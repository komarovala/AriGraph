without band or promenade,\nwithout even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement\nbeing the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of\na small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill\nchance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his\nsea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of\nhim, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he\nresides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely\nnothing!Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for\nthose few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares\nalike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one\'s hands and look\nat the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps\nto count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest\nalways--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that\nstone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside\nthem, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our\nfeet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of\nhumanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,\ngreatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and\nmoat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,\nhave we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy\nif by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will\nsoon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse\nwhom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the\nleg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be\nthe ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the\n"hedges" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the\ncreatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,\nas it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one\nanother, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at\nthe sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of\nquadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We\nsat in a row on the top of the "hedge," enjoying the golden afternoon,\nand scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;\neverything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,\nsummer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and\ndistant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we\nhad nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought\nthe news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its\nvery best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,\nthough small were our possibilities of toilette."Nobody knows us, and we know\nnobody."A position rather rare to those who "dwell among their own people,"\nwho take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable\ncredulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in\nits pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,\nbut courtesy--a courtesy that was given with a kindliness and accepted\nwith a quiet independence which seemed characteristic of these Cornish\nfolk.Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know\na single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener\nat the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty\ngarden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of\nrich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas\ngrew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid\nas trees.In front of the open hall door']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Grand\nCommander, "Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal," and then an\nimmense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the\ncandidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come.The scheme\nof bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular\nduring the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been\noriginal with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the\nmany atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order.Some time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the\norder from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St.Among the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf.Burnett of\nCincinnati, and Gov.They arrived at\nthe lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall\nof the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them.The visitors\nwere arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads,\nand looked more like the prisoners in the play of "Lucretia Borgia"\nthan members of modern civilization.On the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha\nFalls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole.This\norganization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour\none of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev.John Penman\nto consent to become one of its members.Penman was so highly\nIndignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the\ninitiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work,\nwith numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper\'s Weekly.The exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines,\nand ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented\na dark and gloomy appearance.The reverend gentleman was judge of\nprobate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly\ndiminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his\nadvantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never\ncherished much love for each other.The ravings of the Eatanswill\nGazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little\npapers in describing the shortcomings of their "vile and reptile\ncontemporary."After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known\nthat the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the\nmanagers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively\ncampaign for the office of state printer.Both papers had worked hard\nfor the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims\non the party for recognition.Both offices were badly in need of\nfinancial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful\none of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend.How to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the\nproblem that confronted the legislature about to assemble.The war of\nwords between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity.The\neditor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times\nas "Mr.Timothy Muggins Newson"--his right name being Thomas M.\nNewson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr.Foster as the\n"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian."To effect a\nreconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic\ntalent of the party leaders.After frequent consultations between the\nleading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was\narranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the\npaper should be the Minnesotian and Times.It can readily be seen\nthat a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was\nnot likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity.The\nrelations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one\nmanagement than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate.This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature\nadjourned, when the partnership was dissolved.Foster assumed\nentire control of the Minnesotian and Maj.Foster in the\npublication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when\nthe offices separated it was stipulated that Mr.Moore should have the\nprinting of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part\npayment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson,\nMoore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the\npaper he helped to found.After the arrangement was made it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville\nBrown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state\nprinter and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that\nvillage.Newson until\nthe first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R.Marshall\nand Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St.The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the\nMinnesotian, and in a short time Dr.Foster was compelled to surrender\nto its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire\nplant.This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies.Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in\nthe volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W.\nMoore was appointed collector of the port of St.Paul, a position he\nheld for more than twenty years.*       *       *       *       *\n\nDoes any one remember that St.Paul had a paper called the Daily North\nStar?Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever\nhave chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet.During\nthe presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the\nDouglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats.There\nwere only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of\nMr.Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson\nIndependent--and as they had been designated by the president to\npublish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary\nto print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the\nadministration colors at the head of their columns.They were called\n"bread and butter papers."Breckinridge thought\ntheir cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an\norgan at the capital of the state.Young,\nthe editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that\nvillage and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance.It was not\nnecessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a\nperfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily\nnewspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six\ncases of type were all that were necessary.This paper was published\nregularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the\nofficeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it\nsoon collapsed.Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper\nhistory.Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by\nDr.Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to\nGov.This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its\nviolent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with\nmuch favor, and only existed about eight months.*       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about\nhalf a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt.They could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one.Occasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the\nbetter of him and he would uncork a bottle.Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested\nin a printing office for more than two years.During the campaign\nof 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed\npolitical organizations intended to attract the attention of voters.One dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an\nactive member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge\nSquare as they were returning to their hall after a long march.In order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two\norganisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian\noffice in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this\nnauseating beverage.The invitation was\nreadily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the\nadvocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black\nRepublican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky.Bottle after\nbottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats\nof these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much\ngusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation\nthat produced his twenty years\' sleep.One of the cardinal principles\nof the Democracy, at that time was to "love rum and hate <DW65>s."As\nthe entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of\nmarch, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of\ntheir platform was rigidly adhered to.THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862.NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE\nGREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH\nCOULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST.In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations\ncalling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of\nreinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern\nrebellion.It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the\nhistory of the Civil war.McClellan had been compelled to make a\nprecipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond;\nthe army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe\nreverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not\nbeen able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy;\nrebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in\nKentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant\nwatch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which\nthey readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid\nin the prosecution of their cause.France was preparing to invade\nMexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment\nof a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister\nrepublic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save\nRussia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to\nthe success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention\nin behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the\ngovernment in the North were especially active in their efforts\nto prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president;\nconspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by\ngovernment detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring\nto spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North.It was\nduring this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression\nof the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the\nhistory of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of\nMinnesota.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope\nwith an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be.By the\nterms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the\nSioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide\non each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big\nStone lake.In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river\nwas sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow.The selling of\nthis strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little\nCrow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction.The sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the\nsouth side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor.There was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits\nof civilization and worked like white men.This was very distasteful\nto many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before\nthe treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game\nand sell fur to traders.The government built houses for those who\ndesired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them\nhow to farm.At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak\nthey had several hundred acres of land under cultivation.The\ndisinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced\ndissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the\nwhite man\'s party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and\nthe Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who\nbelieved it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform\nmanual labor.The white man\'s, or farmer\'s party, was favored by the\ngovernment, some of them having fine houses built for them.The other\nIndians did not like this, and became envious of them because they\ndiscontinued the customs of the tribe.There was even said to have\nbeen a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was\nto declare war upon the whites.The Indians also claimed that they\nwere not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely\nentirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they\nwere ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the\npaymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and\noften leaving many of them in debt.They protested against permitting\nthe traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and\ndeduct from their small annuities the amount due them.They had at\nleast one white man\'s idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they\ngot ready.*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the\nagencies to get their money.Day after day and week after week passed\nand there was no sign of paymasters.The year 1862 was the the second\nyear of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been\ntaxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war,\nit looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota.Many\nof the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money\nand their families were suffering.The Indians were told that on\naccount of the great war in which the government was engaged the\npayment would never be made.Their annuities were payable in gold and\nthey were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with.Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go\nSouth, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to\nbelieve that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and\nget their land back.It was believed that the men who had enlisted\nlast had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they\ncould clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and\nChippewas would come to their assistance.It is known that the Sioux\nhad been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief,\nbut the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an\nunderstanding.It was even said at the time that the Confederate\ngovernment had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report\nand no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness.*       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called\nupon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth\nand Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men\nmustered in when the news reached St.Paul that open hostilities had\ncommenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the\nwhites was taking place.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that\nthey were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their\nindignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these\ntreacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers\nof the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had,\nwithout a moment\'s warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of\nmen, women and children.It was a singular fact that farmer Indians,\nwhom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard\nto civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after\nhostilities had actually commenced.*       *       *       *       *\n\nA few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency\na portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county.There they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood.It was\nthe first step in the great massacre that soon followed.On the\nmorning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an\nindiscriminate massacre was inaugurated.A detachment of Company B of\nthe Fifth regiment, under command of Capt.Marsh, went to the scene\nof the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their\nnumber, including the captain, killed.The horrible work of murder,\npillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux\nreservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions\nof the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and\nSeminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when\ncompared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this\nterrible outbreak.In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed,\nseveral million dollars\' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people\nrendered homeless.The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern\nboundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota\nriver, had been in a twinkling depopulated.How to repel these\ninvaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the\nstate as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied,\nwas the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national\nauthorities.*       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received,\nword was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were\nassuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and\nChippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been\ninfluenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an\nindiscriminate massacre of the whites.Indian Agent Walker undertook\nto arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had\nscented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which\ncaused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and\nthey were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable\ntribes.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the\nextraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless\nsettlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every\nside, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session\nof the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip\nvolunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of\nshelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky\nwarriors.Ramsey\'s picture\nof the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature?"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages\ncould wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from\nthe category of their crimes," said the governor."Helplessness and\ninnocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs,\nseemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage.Infants hewn\ninto bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the\nmurdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her\npulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful\ntragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by\nthese brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into\ncaptivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families\nburned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself\nwith outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating\nthe bodies of the dead.Such are the spectacles, and a thousand\nnameless horrors besides which this first experience of Indian\nwarfare has burned into the minds and hearts of our frontier people;\nand such the enemy with whom we have to deal."*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old saying that the only good Indians are dead ones had a noble\nexception in the person of Other Day, who piloted sixty-two men,\nwomen and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to\nKandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver.Other Day\nwas an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days,\nbut experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak\nand had adopted the habits of civilization.Paul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver,\nand in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll\nhall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of\nhome guards, he said: "I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the\nmidst of evil.I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing.I\nhave been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write.I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and\nthus learned my vileness.At the present time I have fallen into great\nevil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men,\nwomen and children, without moccasins, without food and without a\nblanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my\nheart is glad.I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit."Other\nDay had been a member of the church for several years and his religion\ntaught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest.Sibley,\non account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed\nin command of the troops ordered to assemble at St.Peter, and in\na few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming,\nhalf-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition,\ncommenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins.The\nnewspapers and the people were crying "On to Ridgely!"which was then\nbeleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl "On\nto Richmond!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nAny one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of "The Girl\nI Left Behind Me" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the\nlittle garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the\nforces under command of Gen.Fort Ridgely was a fort only\nin name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden\nbuildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection\nwhen attacked by a large force.The garrison was under the command of\nLieut.His force consisted of about 150 men from the\nFifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of\ncivilians.He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and\nequipped.Although there were only two attempts made to capture the\ngarrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days.In\naddition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support\nand protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long\nexpected, arrived there the day before the outbreak.After bravely\ndefending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was\nrelieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command\nof Col.McPhail, being the advance of Gen.During\nthe siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and\nspherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with\nbusy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces\nand used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror\namong the redskins.Almost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in\nlarge numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident\nintention of burning and pillaging the village.Judge Charles E.\nFlandrau of this city, who was then residing at St.Peter, organized a\ncompany of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of\nthat place.The judge received several acquisitions to his force while\nen route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of\nabout 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience.They arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in\ndriving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several\ncitizens having been killed and a number of houses burned.Two or\nthree days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded\nthe town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts.After\na desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge\nFlandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired.There were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or\n1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had\nthe Indian attack been successful.Provisions and ammunition becoming\nscarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the\ncountry to Mankato.They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded\nthem with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the\nfight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested.Nearly\ntwo hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving\nnothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed\nbarricade.The long procession of families leaving their desolated\nhomes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes\nin the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the\ngallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a\nplace of safety.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen.Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A\nof the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt.Paul,\nand seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt.Paul, and several citizen volunteers,\nall under the command of Maj.Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with\ninstructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could\nbe found, from their perilous surroundings.Paul\norganizations and most all of their members were St.They\nnever had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not\nfamiliar with the use of firearms.After marching for two days, during\nwhich time they interred a large number of victims of the savage\nSioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from\nFort Ridgely.The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of\ntimber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet\non the other.It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the\ncommand to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been\nknown that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors.Brown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command.About 4\no\'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or\n600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate\nfire upon the almost helpless little command.For two days they\nbravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was\nfound that about half their number had been killed or wounded.When\nthe news of the disaster reached St.Relatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in\ntheir denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were\nresponsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens.It\nwas feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the\nsavages.Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view\nof the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers.There was no\ntelegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick\nand fast.Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh\noutrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover\nfrom the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be\nreceived.Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were\narriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their\nhouses to be destroyed.The situation was appalling, and many of our\ncitizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail\nto check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin.Every boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees,\nand the people of St.Paul were often called upon to assist in\nforwarding them to their place of destination.Home guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened\nportion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms\nor ammunition and their services would have been of little account\nagainst the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked.Paul newspapers offering rewards of\n$25 a piece for Sioux scalps.*       *       *       *       *\n\nGov.Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and\npublished in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents\nof the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of\nthe Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley,\n150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine\ncounty, 210 miles distant.This may have been gratifying to the\nresidents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the\nfrontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were\nseeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout 12 o\'clock one night during the latter part of August a report\nwas circulated over the northern and western portion of St.Paul that\nthe savages were near the city, and many women and children were\naroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the\nprotection of the city authorities.It was an exciting but rather\namusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the\nfrontier.Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was\nnot until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St.Paul\nfelt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen.Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable\nhim to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations.He had\ncollected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including\nthe Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of\nCapt.Daniel travelled to the garden.The expedition marched for two or three days\nwithout encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of\nSeptember several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment\nwere fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake.About 800 of the command\nwere engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal\nnumber of Indians.Marshall, with\nabout 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded\nin utterly routing them.Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty\nwounded.This was the only real battle of the war.Other Day was with\nthe whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter.Pope, who was in command of the department of the\nNorthwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was\nover and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his\ncommand.Daniel went to the bathroom.Pope was met with a decided remonstrance\nby the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the\nremoval of any of the troops until they had made two long marches\nthrough the Dakotas and to Montana.Sibley\'s command reached Camp\nRelease on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was\nlocated a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the\nmassacres.They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods\nand white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to\nprecede at once to their rescue.Sibley was of the opinion that\nany hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the\nprisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution.After a\nfew preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the\ncaptives were released.Sibley made inquiries\nas to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes\nrecently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of\nthem had been guilty of the grossest atrocities.The general decided\nto form a military tribunal and try the offenders.After a series of\nsittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November,\n321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of\nwhom were sentenced to death and the']
