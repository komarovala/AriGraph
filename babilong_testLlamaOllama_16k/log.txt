EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Grandmother told her that if she and Grandfather had been\nwasteful in their younger days, we would not have any silk dresses to\nwear now.Anna said if that was the case she was glad that Grandmother\nsaved the basting thread!1866\n\n_February_ 13.--Our brother James was married to-day to Louise\nLivingston James of New York City._February_ 20.--Our society is going to hold a fair for the Freedmen, in\nthe Town Hall.Susie Daggett and I have been there all day to see about\nthe tables and stoves._February_ 21.--Been at the hall all day, trimming the room.Backus came down and if they had not helped us we would\nnot have done much.Backus put up all the principal drapery and made\nit look beautiful._February_ 22.--At the hall all day.We had\nquite a crowd in the evening and took in over three hundred dollars.Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there all night to take care\nof the hall.We had a fish pond, a grab-bag and a post-office.Anna says\nthey had all the smart people in the post-office to write the\nletters,--Mr.Morse, Miss Achert, Albert Granger and herself.Some one\nasked Albert Granger if his law business was good and he said one man\nthronged into his office one day._February_ 23.--We took in two hundred dollars to-day at the fair.George Willson if she could not\nwrite a poem expressing our thanks to Mr.Backus and she stepped aside\nfor about five minutes and handed us the following lines which we sent\nto him.We think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair."In ancient time the God of Wine\n    They crowned with vintage of the vine,\n    And sung his praise with song and glee\n    And all their best of minstrelsy.The Backus whom we honor now\n    Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow\n    With heathen emblems--better he\n    Will love our gratitude to see\n    Expressed in all the happy faces\n    Assembled in these pleasant places.May joy attend his footsteps here\n    And crown him in a brighter sphere."_February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to\nclean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of\neverything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this\nafternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the\nexpenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of\nthanks:\n\n_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the\nTown Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,\nand the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks\nto the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous\ncontributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public\nenterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young\nladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such\ngenerous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need\nnever again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as\nCanandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But\nour village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New\nYork City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and\nunstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of\nthe hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor\nwould have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are\nespecially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their\nsuperior knowledge and older experience.W. P. Fiske for his\nvaluable services as cashier, and to Messrs.Daggett, Chapin and Hills\nfor services at the door; and to all the little boys and girls who\nhelped in so many ways.The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks to our cashier, the\nmoney is all good, and will soon be on its way carrying substantial\nvisions of something to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor\nFreedmen of the South.By order of Society,\n                                            Carrie C. Richards, Pres\'t.Emma H. Wheeler, Sec\'y.Editor--I expected to see an account of the Young Ladies\' Fair in\nyour last number, but only saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the\nladies to the citizens.Your "local" must have been absent; and I beg\nthe privilege in behalf of myself and many others of doing tardy justice\nto the successful efforts of the Aid Society at their debut February\n22nd.Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and the Society did the\nrest.The decorations were in excellent taste, and so were the young\nladies.The skating pond was never in\nbetter condition.On entering the hall I paused first before the table\nof toys, fancy work and perfumery.Here was the President, and I hope I\nshall be pardoned for saying that no President since the days of\nWashington can compare with the President of this Society.Then I\nvisited a candy table, and hesitated a long time before deciding which I\nwould rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the charming\ncreatures who sold them.One delicious morsel, in a pink silk, was so\ntempting that I seriously contemplated eating her with a\nspoon--waterfall and all.[By the way, how do we know that the Romans\nwore waterfalls?Because Marc Antony, in his funeral oration on Mr.Caesar, exclaimed, "O water fall was there, my countrymen!"]At this\npoint my attention was attracted by a fish pond.I tried my luck, caught\na whale, and seeing all my friends beginning to blubber, I determined to\nvisit the old woman who lived in a shoe.--She was very glad to see me.I\nbought one of her children, which the Society can redeem for $1,000 in\nsmoking caps.The fried oysters were delicious; a great many of the bivalves got into\na stew, and I helped several of them out.Delicate ice cream, nicely\n"baked in cowld ovens," was destroyed in immense quantities.I scream\nwhen I remember the plates full I devoured, and the number of bright\nwomen to whom I paid my devours.Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant\nHavanas, and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra.The fair\npost-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they were almost\nfairies, drove a very thriving business.--Let no man say hereafter that\nthe young ladies of Canandaigua are uneducated in all that makes women\nlovely and useful.The\nmembers of this Society have won the admiration of all their friends,\nand especially of the most devoted of their servants,\n                                                            Q. E. D.\n\nIf I had written that article, I should have given the praise to Susie\nDaggett, for it belongs to her._Sunday, June_ 24.--My Sunday School scholars are learning the shorter\ncatechism.One recited thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another\ntwenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.They do\nnot see why it is called the "shorter" Catechism!They all had their\nambrotypes taken with me yesterday at Finley\'s--Mary Hoyt, Fannie and\nElla Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw\nand Katie Neu.They are all going to dress in white and sit on the front\nseat in church at my wedding.Gooding make\nindividual fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each member of\nour sewing society._Thursday, June_ 21.--We went to a lawn fete at Mrs.F. F. Thompson\'s\nthis afternoon.The flowers, the grounds, the\nyoung people and the music all combined to make the occasion perfect._Note:_ Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.Thompson, who has\npreviously given the village a children\'s playground, a swimming school,\na hospital and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented a\npark as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua Lake._June_ 28.--Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams were married in the\nCongregational church this evening.The church was trimmed beautifully\nand Abbie looked sweet.We attended the reception afterwards at her\nhouse."May calm and sunshine hallow their clasped hands."_July_ 15.--The girls of the Society have sent me my flag bed quilt,\nwhich they have just finished.It was hard work quilting such hot days\nbut it is done beautifully.Bessie Seymour wrote the names on the stars.In the center they used six stars for "Three rousing cheers for the\nUnion."Sandra travelled to the hallway.The names on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie\nPaul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett, Fannie Pierce, Sarah\nAndrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie Williams, Carrie Lamport, Isadore Blodgett,\nNannie Corson, Laura Chapin, Mary F. Fiske, Lucilla F. Pratt, Jennie H.\nHazard, Sarah H. Foster, Mary Jewett, Mary C. Stevens, Etta Smith,\nCornelia Richards, Ella Hildreth, Emma Wheeler, Mary Wheeler, Mrs.Pierce, Alice Jewett, Bessie Seymour, Clara Coleman, Julia Phelps.It\nkept the girls busy to get Abbie Clark\'s quilt and mine finished within\none month.They hope that the rest of the girls will postpone their\nnuptials till there is a change in the weather.Mercury stands 90\ndegrees in the shade._July_ 19, 1866.--Our wedding day.We saw the dear little Grandmother,\nGod bless her, watching us from the window as we drove away.Alexandria Bay, _July_ 26.--Anna writes me that Charlie Wells said he\nhad always wanted a set of Clark\'s Commentaries, but I had carried off\nthe entire Ed._July_ 28.--As we were changing boats at Burlington, Vt, for Saratoga,\nto our surprise, we met Captain and Abbie Williams, but could only stop\na moment.Saratoga, 29_th._--We heard Rev.Theodore Cuyler preach to-day from the\ntext, "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."He\nleads devotional exercises every morning in the parlors of the Columbian\nHotel.I spoke to him this morning and he said my father was one of his\nbest and earliest friends.Canandaigua, _September_ 1.--A party of us went down to the Canandaigua\nhotel this morning to see President Johnson, General Grant and Admiral\nFarragut and other dignitaries.The train stopped about half an hour and\nthey all gave brief speeches.1867\n\n_July_ 27.--Col.James M. Bull was buried from the home of Mr.Alexander\nHowell to-day, as none of his family reside here now._November_ 13.--Our brother John and wife and baby Pearl have gone to\nLondon, England, to live._December_ 28.--A large party of Canandaiguans went over to Rochester\nlast evening to hear Charles Dickens\' lecture, and enjoyed it more than\nI can possibly express.He was quite hoarse and had small bills\ndistributed through the Opera House with the announcement:\n\n                    MR.CHARLES DICKENS\n\n    Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its effects\n    may not be very perceptible after a few minutes\' Reading.We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.It was worth a great deal just to look upon the man\nwho wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the other books,\nwhich have delighted us so much.We hope that he will live to write a\ngreat many more.He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic\nreception in this country and almost apologized for some of the opinions\nthat he had expressed in his "American Notes," which he published, after\nhis first visit here, twenty-five years ago.He evidently thinks that\nthe United States of America are quite worth while.1871\n\n_August_ 6.--Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A., Hon.George H. Stuart,\nPresident of the U. S. Christian Commission, spoke in an open air\nmeeting on the square this afternoon and in our church this evening.The\nhouse was packed and such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips.He\nought to be called the Whitefield of America.He told of the good the\nChristian Commission had done before the war and since.They took up a collection which must have amounted to\nhundreds of dollars.1872\n\n_Naples, June._--John has invited Aunt Ann Field, and James, his wife\nand me and Babe Abigail to come to England to make them a visit, and we\nexpect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.Baltic, July_ 7.--We left New York yesterday under\nfavorable circumstances.It was a beautiful summer day, flags were\nflying and everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we were leaving\nhome and native land.There were many passengers, among them being Mr.Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded the steamer\nfrom a tug boat which came down the bay alongside when we had been out\nhalf an hour.President Grant was with him and stood on deck, smoking\nthe proverbial cigar.We were glad to see him and the passengers gave\nhim three cheers and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm._Liverpool, July_ 16.--We arrived here to-day, having been just ten days\non the voyage.There were many clergymen of note on board, among them,\nRev.John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,\nwho is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our\ntable and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They\nheld services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the\nsteamer, and also in the steerage where the text was "And they willingly\nreceived him into the ship."Sandra went to the bedroom.The immigrants listened eagerly, when the\nminister urged them all to "receive Jesus."We enjoyed several evening\nliterary entertainments, when it was too cold or windy to sit on deck.We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner to-night, that I ever\nate.So large and red and ripe, with the hulls on and we dipped them in\npowdered sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way._London, July_ 17.--On our way to London to-day I noticed beautiful\nflower beds at every station, making our journey almost a path of roses.In the fields, men and women both, were harvesting the hay, making\npicturesque scenes, for the sky was cloudless and I was reminded of the\nold hymn, commencing\n\n    "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\n    Stand dressed in living green."We performed the journey from Liverpool to London, a distance of 240\nmiles, in five hours.John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston\nStation, and we were soon whirled away in cabs to 24 Upper Woburn Place,\nTavistock Square, John\'s residence.Dinner was soon ready, a most\nbountiful repast.We spent the remainder of the day visiting and\nenjoying ourselves generally.It seemed so good to be at the end of the\njourney, although we had only two days of really unpleasant weather on\nthe voyage.John and Laura are so kind and hospitable.They have a\nbeautiful home, lovely children and apparently every comfort and luxury\nwhich this world can afford._Sunday, July_ 22.--We went to Spurgeon\'s Tabernacle this morning to\nlisten to this great preacher, with thousands of others.I had never\nlooked upon such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery\nwhere we sat.The pulpit was underneath one gallery, so there seemed as\nmany people over the preacher\'s head, as there were beneath and around\nhim and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.I thought of the\nhymn, "Hark ten thousand harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise\nabove."Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that he used two canes\nand placed one knee on a chair beside him, when preaching.His text was\n"And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth."I found that all I\nhad heard of his eloquence was true._Sunday, July_ 29.--We have spent the entire week sightseeing, taking in\nHyde Park, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, St.Paul\'s Cathedral, the\nTower of London and British Museum.We also went to Madame Tussaud\'s\nexhibition of wax figures and while I was looking in the catalogue for\nthe number of an old gentleman who was sitting down apparently asleep,\nhe got up and walked away!We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London,\nto see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the "Christmas Palace."Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and came\nto see us to-day._August_ 13.--Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping and sightseeing in\nthis great city, my diary has been well nigh forgotten.The descriptive\nletters to home friends have been numerous and knowing that they would\nbe preserved, I thought perhaps they would do as well for future\nreference as a diary kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.Pancras\' bell was tolling and a funeral procession going by, we heard by\ncable of the death of our dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first\nencouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most\ninterested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I\nwould, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in\nmy heart.She has only stepped inside the\ntemple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord\'s entrance\ncall.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It\ndoes not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my\ndear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting\nblessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go\nand smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that "He who\nholds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,\nwould care for us and bring us to our desired haven."She had received\none letter, telling of our safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going\nabout London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna\'s letter came, after ten days, telling us all\nthe sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last\nnight before she was taken ill, and up at the moon and stars and said\nhow beautiful they were.Anna says, "How can I ever write it?Our dear\nlittle Grandmother died on my bed to-day."_August_ 30.--John, Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field\nand I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow\nwhere we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were\nabout to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.Sherman\nof U.S.A.We stopped to look at him and felt like\ntelling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and\nspirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak\na-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at\nInversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the\nTrossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, "All aboard for\nNaples," it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely\nin Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming\ncity, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw\nthe window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also\nvisited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the\nAbbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went\nthrough the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the\nlibrary.Sir Walter\'s chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but\nLaura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for\na moment saying "I am sure, now, he will be clever."We continued our\njourney that night and arrived in London the next morning._Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September_ 9.--Aunt Ann, Laura\'s sister,\nFlorentine Arnold, nurse and two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are\nhere for three weeks on the seashore._September_ 16.--We have visited all the neighboring towns, the graves\nof the Dairyman\'s daughter and little Jane, the young cottager, and the\nscene of Leigh Richmond\'s life and labors.We have enjoyed bathing in\nthe surf, and the children playing in the sands and riding on the\ndonkeys.We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by an old couple, Mr.Tuddenham, down on the esplanade.They serve excellent meals in a\nmost homelike way.We have an abundance of delicious milk and cream\nwhich they tell me comes from "Cowes"!_London, September_ 30.--Anna has come to England to live with John for\nthe present.She came on the Adriatic, arriving September 24.We are so\nglad to see her once more and will do all in our power to cheer her in\nher loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,\narrived here to-day for a few days\' visit.We had rather a stormy\npassage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel\nand he answered me "The H\'Albert H\'Edward, Miss!"This information must\nhave given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached\nCalais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere\nla Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just\nas they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre\nwithout seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer\'s, Le\nJeune, to be "taken" and had a funny time.He queried "Parlez-vous\nFrancais?"I shook my head and asked him "Parlez-vous Anglaise?"at\nwhich query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to\ntell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two\nsizes of pictures and asked me "Le cabinet, le vignette?"I held up my\nfingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to\nmake ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he\nhoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the\nfirst sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed\nto and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said "Tres\nbien, Madame," and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed\n"tres bien."We visited the Tomb of Napoleon to-day._October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I\nenjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue\nfor the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a\nPresbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The\nsinging in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang "Awake my soul\nto joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer\'s praise," it seemed to me\nthat I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in\nthe refrain "His loving kindness, oh how free."The text was "As an\neagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad\nher wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead\nhim and there was no strange God with him."It was a\nwonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we\nnoticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were\nstanding in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of\nSunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I\nhave only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an\nEnglishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being\nso much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, "In America,\nyou have the \'ops, I know, but you haven\'t the Thames water, you know."_Sunday, November_ 3.--We went to hear Rev.He is a new light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival\nSpurgeon and Newman Hall and all the rest.He is like a lion and again\nlike a lamb in the pulpit._Liverpool, November_ 6.--I came down to Liverpool to-day with Abbie and\nnurse, to sail on the Baltic, to-morrow.There were two Englishmen in\nour compartment and hearing Abbie sing "I have a Father in the Promised\nLand," they asked her where her Father lived and she said "In America,"\nand told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then\nthey turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that\nthe latest cable from America was that U. S. Grant was elected for his\nsecond term as President of the United States.I assured them that I was\nvery glad to hear such good news._November_ 9.--I did not know any of the passengers when we sailed, but\nsoon made pleasant acquaintances.Sykes from New York and in course of conversation I found that she as\nwell as myself, was born in Penn Yan, Yates County, New York, and that\nher parents were members of my Father\'s church, which goes to prove that\nthe world is not so very wide after all.Abbie is a great pet among the\npassengers and is being passed around from one to another from morning\ntill night.They love to hear her sing and coax her to say "Grace" at\ntable.She closes her eyes and folds her hands devoutly and says, "For\nwhat we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful."They\nall say "Amen" to this, for they are fearful that they will not perhaps\nbe "thankful" when they finish!_November_ 15.--I have been on deck every day but one, and not missed a\nsingle meal.There was a terrible storm one night and the next morning I\ntold one of the numerous clergymen, that I took great comfort in the\nnight, thinking that nothing could happen with so many of the Lord\'s\nanointed, on board.He said that he wished he had thought of that, for\nhe was frightened almost to death!We have sighted eleven steamers and\non Wednesday we were in sight of the banks of Newfoundland all the\nafternoon, our course being unusually northerly and we encountered no\nfogs, contrary to the expectation of all.Every one pronounces the\nvoyage pleasant and speedy for this time of year._Naples, N. Y., November_ 20.--We arrived safely in New York on Sunday.Abbie spied her father very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up\nand with glad and happy hearts we returned his "Welcome home."We spent\ntwo days in New York and arrived home safe and sound this evening._November_ 21.--My thirtieth birthday, which we, a reunited family, are\nspending happily together around our own fireside, pleasant memories of\nthe past months adding to the joy of the hour.From the _New York Evangelist_ of August 15, 1872, by Rev."Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,\nwidow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose\nmaiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,\nand of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of\nCanandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived\nnearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of\nwhom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the\nCongregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful\nsupporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the\nsimple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age\nof which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner\nwhich repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning\ngrace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would\nalmost involuntarily \'rise up before her,\' yet loved to be in her\npresence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love\nand peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children\'s\nchildren what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to\nresort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie\nwhich bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a\ndeep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she\nand her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in\nthe church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its\nactivity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good\nwork.While she was well informed in all current events, she most\ndelighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious\nbooks were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her\nbetter thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her\nnever saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited\nthe Master\'s call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock\nof corn fully ripe that cometh in its season."I don\'t think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down\nthings of importance.Noah T. Clarke\'s brother got possession of my\nlittle diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written\non the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:\n\n    "You\'d scarce expect a volume of my size\n    To hold so much that\'s beautiful and wise,\n    And though the heartless world might call me cheap\n    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,\n    And kindly shelter all who toil below,\n    So my future greatness and the good I do\n    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few."I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon\nan old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her\nyouthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, "Try to be somebody," and\non the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for\nunexpected achievement which she could not prevent, "Some must be\ngreat!"*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n1880\n\n_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A. Cummings\nof Oakland, Cal., and has gone there to live.I am sorry to have her go\nso far away, but love annihilates space.There is no real separation,\nexcept in alienation of spirit, and that can never come--to us.THE END\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOKS TO MAKE ELDERS YOUNG AGAIN\n\nBy Inez Haynes Gillmore\n\nPHOEBE AND ERNEST\n\nWith 30 illustrations by R.

WILLIAMSON\'S THE PRINCESS PASSES\n\nIllustrated by Edward Penfield.Another ball struck the crupper of his saddle, and another one\nbored a hole through Prince\'s right ear.As soon as he was out of sight Fred stopped, and, ascertaining that no\ndamage had been done, excepting the perforating of Prince\'s ear and his\nhat, he patted his horse\'s neck and said: "Ah, Prince, old boy, you are\nmarked now for life, but it is all right.I shall always know you by\nthat little hole through your ear."Fred stopped that night at a planter\'s house, who at first viewed him\nwith some suspicion; but when he was told of Buckner\'s advance, he was\nso overjoyed, being an ardent Secessionist, that there was nothing good\nenough for his guest.The next day, when Fred rode into Lebanon, the first man that he saw\nwas Mathews, who sauntered up to him, and said in a sarcastic tone: "It\nseems, young man, that you made a short visit to your poor sick\ngrandfather."I didn\'t\nsee the old gentleman; I concluded to come back.Things are getting a\nlittle too brisk up there for me.Buckner has advanced, and there may be\nsome skirmishing around Elizabethtown.""And so you run," exclaimed Mathews in a tone which made Fred\'s blood\nboil.All of this time Mathews had been carefully looking over the boy\nand horse, and quite a crowd had collected around them.continued Mathews; "a round hole through your horse\'s ear, been\nbleeding, too; your saddle torn by a bullet, and a hole through your\nhat.Boy, you had better give an account of yourself.""Not at your command," replied Fred, hotly."And I deny your right to\nquestion me.""You do, do you, my fine young fellow?I will show you," and he made a\ngrab for Prince\'s bridle.A sharp, quick word from Fred, and the horse sprang, overthrowing\nMathews, and scattering the crowd right and left.Mathews arose, shaking\nthe dust from his clothes and swearing like a trooper.A fine-looking man had just ridden up to the crowd as the incident\noccurred.He looked after the flying boy, and nervously fingered the\nrevolver in his holster.Then a smile came over his face, and he spoke\nto Mathews, who was still swearing and loudly calling for a horse to\npursue Fred."No use, Jim; you might as well chase a streak of lightning.That is the\nfastest horse in Kentucky."Mathews looked at the man a moment in surprise, and then exclaimed:\n"Heavens!"Made a run for it night before last," replied Morgan with a laugh, "to\nkeep from being nabbed by old Thomas.But what was the fuss between you\nand that boy?I wonder what he was doing out here any way?But, Mathews,\nhe did upset you nicely; I think you rolled over at least six times.""I will be even with him yet," growled Mathews.I have heard half a dozen men say that, myself included.But let\'s\nhear what the rumpus was about."When Morgan heard the story, he said: "So Buckner is at Elizabethtown,\nis he?I was going to Bowling Green, but now\nI will change my course to Elizabethtown.But I would like to know what\nthat boy has been doing.From what you say he must have been in a\nskirmish.Trying to throw a train off the track, perhaps; it would be\njust like him.""But, Mathews," he continued, "the boy is gone, so let us talk\nbusiness.I am going to raise a regiment of cavalry for the Confederate\nservice, and I want you to raise a company.""That I will, John," said Mathews."There is no other man I had rather\nride under."Fred laughed heartily as he looked back and saw Mathews shaking the dust\nfrom himself.Finding that he was not pursued he brought Prince down to\na walk."I could almost swear," he said to himself, "that I caught a\nglimpse of Morgan as I dashed through the crowd.Thomas surely ought to\nhave him before this time.As he was riding through Danville he met his uncle, Judge Pennington,\nwho, to his surprise, greeted him most cordially, and would insist on\nhis stopping a while."Over towards Elizabethtown to see my sick grandfather," replied Fred,\ngravely.asked his uncle, somewhat nettled."Well, uncle, I have been over towards Elizabethtown ostensibly to see\nmy grandfather, but really to see what I could find over there.""I found Buckner\'s men as thick as hops, and I found a warm reception\nbesides.Look here," and he showed his uncle the hole through his hat."If you will go out and look at Prince, you will find a hole through\nhis ear, and you will also find the saddle torn with a bullet.Oh, yes,\nBuckner\'s men were glad to see me; they gave me a warm reception.""Oh, I side-tracked one of their trains.""Fred," said he, "you are engaging in\ndangerous business.I have heard of\nsome of your doings.Mary moved to the hallway."Then it was he I saw at Lebanon."Because--because--I thought--I thought he was in Lexington.""It was because," answered the judge, severely, "that you thought he was\na prisoner at Camp Dick Robinson.Ah, Fred, you were not as sharp as you\nthought.You foiled their plans; but, thank God!All pretense of neutrality is now at an\nend.These men will now be found in the ranks, fighting for the liberty\nof the South.As for Morgan, he will be heard from, mark my word.""He is a daring fellow, and sharp,\ntoo; yes, I believe he will be heard from.""Fred, Morgan thinks you have had more to do with finding out their\nplans than any other one person.""Morgan does me too much honor," replied Fred, quietly.The judge remained quiet for a moment, and then said: "My boy, I wish\nyou could have seen Morgan before you had so thoroughly committed\nyourself to the other side.He\nbelieves if he could talk with you, you might be induced to change your\nmind.He says in the kind of work in which he expects to engage, you\nwould be worth a brigade of men.Fred, will you, will you not think of\nthis?You are breaking our hearts with your course now.""Dear uncle," replied Fred, "I thank Morgan for his good opinion, and I\nreciprocate his opinion; for of all the men I have met, I believe he,\nmost of all, has the elements of a dashing, successful leader.But as\nfor his offer, I cannot consider it for a moment."The judge sighed, and Fred saw that his further presence was not\ndesirable, so he made his adieus, and rode away.Morgan wants to win me over," thought Fred, "and that was the\nreason uncle was so nice.I think this last scrape has burnt the bridges\nbetween us, and they will trouble me no more."Fred made his report to General Thomas, who heard it with evident\nsatisfaction."This, then, was your idea, Fred?""Yes, General, I in some way conceived the notion that Buckner would try\nto surprise Louisville just as he did try to do.I knew that trains were\nrunning regularly between Nashville and Louisville, and thought that a\nsurprise could be effected.But the idea was so vague I was ashamed to\ntell you, for fear of exciting ridicule.So, I got my leave of absence\nand stole off, and if nothing had come of it, no one would have been the\nwiser."General Thomas smiled, and said: "It was an idea worthy of a great\ngeneral, Fred.General Anderson has much to thank you for, as well as\nthe people of Louisville.But you must take a good rest now, both you\nand your horse.From appearances, I think it will not be many days\nbefore General Zollicoffer will give us plenty to do."FOOTNOTE:\n\n[A] The name of the gallant young man who tore up the track was\nCrutcher; the author does not know the name of the fireman.On October 7th General Anderson, at his own request, was relieved of the\ncommand of the Department of Kentucky, on account of continued\nill-health.The next day General W. T. Sherman, a man destined to fill\nan important place in the history of the war, was appointed to the\nposition.Both the Federal and the Confederate governments had now\nthrown aside all pretense of neutrality.Kentucky echoed to the martial\ntread of armed men.At Maysville under General Nelson, at Camp Dick Robinson under General\nThomas, at Louisville under General Sherman, and at Paducah under\nGeneral Grant, the Federal government was gathering its hosts; while the\nConfederate government with its troops occupied Columbus, Bowling Green,\nCumberland Gap, and the mountains of eastern Kentucky.General Albert\nSydney Johnston, one of the ablest of the Confederate generals, was in\nsupreme command, with headquarters at Bowling Green.General Zollicoffer marched from Cumberland Gap early in the month, and\nassumed offensive operations.When General Sherman took command, Fred was sent by General Thomas to\nLouisville with dispatches.General Sherman had heard of some of the\nexploits of the young messenger, and he was received very kindly.Sherman, at that time, was in the prime of life.Straight as an arrow,\nof commanding presence, he was every inch a soldier.He was quick and\nimpulsive in his actions, and to Fred seemed to be a bundle of nerves.In conversation he was open and frank and expressed his opinion freely,\nin this resembling General Nelson.But the rough, overbearing nature of\nNelson he entirely lacked.He was one of the most courteous of men.He would have Fred tell of some of his exploits, and when he gave an\naccount of his first journey to Louisville, and his adventure with\nCaptain Conway, the general was greatly pleased.Fred\'s account of how\nhe discovered the details of the plot at Lexington was received with\nastonishment, and he was highly complimented.But the climax came when\nhe told of how he had thrown the train from the track, and thus brought\nBuckner\'s intended surprise to naught.The general jumped up, grasped\nFred\'s hand, and exclaimed:\n\n"That, young man, calls for a commission, if I can get you one, and I\nthink I can.""General," replied Fred, "I thank you very much, but I do not wish a\ncommission.It is true, I am hired\nprivately by General Nelson, and if I understand rightly I am getting\nthe pay of a lieutenant; but I am not bound by oath to serve any length\nof time, neither could I have accomplished what I have if I had been a\nregular enlisted soldier.""But remember, if you are ever in\nneed of any favor, do not hesitate to call on me."This Fred readily promised, and left the general, highly elated over the\ninterview.Before leaving Louisville, Fred did not forget to call on the Vaughns.He found Miss Mabel well, and he thought her more beautiful than ever.A\nsad, pensive look on her face but added to her loveliness.Only the day\nbefore she had bidden her betrothed farewell, and he had marched to the\nfront to help fight the battles of his country.As she hung weeping\naround his neck, he pointed to a little miniature flag pinned on his\nbreast--it was the same flag that Mabel wore on that day she was beset\nby the mob--and said:\n\n"Dearest, it shall be worn there as long as my heart beats.Never shall\nit be touched by a traitorous hand as long as I live.Every time I look\nupon it, it will be an incentive to prove worthy of the brave girl who\nwore it on her breast in the face of a brutal mob."Then with one fond clasp of the hands, one long lingering kiss, he was\ngone; and to Mabel all the light and joy of the world seemed to go with\nhim.But the coming of Fred brought new thoughts, and for the time her eyes\ngrew brighter, her cheeks rosier and laugh happier.The bright, brave\nboy who saved her from the mob was very welcome, and to her he was only\na boy, a precious, darling boy.They made Fred relate his adventures, and one minute Mabel\'s eyes would\nsparkle with fun, and the next melt in tenderness.In spite of himself,\nFred\'s heart beat very fast, he hardly knew why.But when he told with\ntrembling voice how he had parted from his father, and how he had been\ndisowned and driven from home, the sympathy of the impulsive girl\novercame her, and with eyes swimming in tears, she arose, threw her arms\naround him, imprinted a kiss on his forehead, and murmured: "Poor boy!Then turning to her mother, she said, "We will adopt him,\nwon\'t we, mother, and I will have a brother."Then remembering what she had done, she retired blushing and in\nconfusion to her seat.That kiss finished Fred; it thrilled him through\nand through.Yet somehow the thought of being a brother to Mabel didn\'t\ngive him any satisfaction.He knew Mabel looked upon him as only a boy,\nand the thought made him angry, but the next moment he was ashamed of\nhimself.He took his leave, promising to call the next time he was in\nthe city, and went away with conflicting emotions.Fred was really suffering from an attack of first love, and didn\'t know\nit.It was better for him that he didn\'t, for it was the sooner\nforgotten.On his return to Camp Dick Robinson Fred found that General Thomas had\nadvanced some of his troops toward Cumberland Gap.Colonel Garrard was\noccupying an exposed position on the Rock Castle Hills, and Fred was\nsent to him with dispatches.Fred found the little command in\nconsiderable doubt over the movements of General Zollicoffer.One hour\nthe rumor would be that he was advancing, and the next hour would bring\nthe story that he was surely retreating.Colonel Garrard feared that he\nwould be attacked with a greatly superior force.Fred resolved that he would do a little scouting on his own account.Colonel Garrard offered to send a small party with him, but Fred\ndeclined the offer, saying that a squad would only attract attention,\nand if he ran into danger he would trust to the fleetness of his horse\nto save him.Riding east, he made a wide detour, and at last came to where he thought\nhe must be near the enemy\'s lines.In his front was a fine plantation;\nnear by, in the woods, some <DW64>s were chopping.These <DW64>s he\nresolved to interview.His appearance created great consternation, and\nsome of them dropped their axes, and looked as if about to run."Don\'t be afraid, boys," said Fred, kindly."I only want to know who\nlives in yonder house.""Not now, sah; he down to Zollicoffer camp.""Oh, then General Zollicoffer is camped near here?""Yes, sah; \'bout two mile down de road.""Do any of the soldiers ever come this way?""Yes, sah; \'bout twenty went up de road not mo\' than two hours ago.Den\na capin man, he cum to see Missy Alice most ebber day.""Thank you," said Fred, as he rode away."I think I will pay a visit to\nMissy Alice myself."Riding boldly up to the house, he dismounted.Before entering the house\nhe accosted an old <DW64> who was working in the yard, and slipping a\ndollar into his hand, said:\n\n"Uncle, if you see any one coming either way, will you cry, \'Massa, your\nhorse is getting away?\'""Trus\' me fo\' dat," said the old man, grinning from ear to ear."I jess\nmake dat hoss jump, and den I yell, \'Massa, hoss gittin\' way.\'""That\'s it, uncle, you are all right," and Fred turned and went into the\nhouse, where he introduced himself as a Mr.He\nhad friends in Zollicoffer\'s army, and had run the gauntlet of the\nFederal lines to visit them.Could they tell him how far it was to\nGeneral Zollicoffer\'s camp.The ladies received him coldly, but told him the distance.But Fred was\nnot to be repulsed.He was a good talker, and he tried his best.He told\nthem the news of the outside world, and what the Yankees were doing, and\nhow they would soon be driven from the State.This at once endeared him\nto the ladies, especially the younger, who was a most pronounced little\nrebel.Miss Alice was a comely girl, somewhere between twenty and\ntwenty-five years of age, and by a little but well directed flattery\nFred completely won her confidence.She inquired after some\nacquaintances in Lexington, and by a happy coincidence Fred knew them,\nand the conversation became animated.At length Fred remarked: "I hope it will not be long before General\nZollicoffer will advance.We are getting anxious up at Lexington; we\nwant to see the Yankees driven into the Ohio.""You will not have to wait long," replied the girl."Captain Conway\ntells me they are about ready, and will advance on the 20th or 21st----"\nshe stopped suddenly, bit her lip, and looked scared.In all probability she had told something that Captain Conway had told\nher to keep secret.Fred did not appear to notice her confusion, and at\nonce said: "Conway, Conway, Captain Conway.Is it Captain P. C. Conway\nof whom you speak?""Yes, sir," replied the girl, brightening up."Why, I know him, know him like a book; in fact, we are old\nfriends--special friends, I may say.He would rejoice to find me here,"\nand then he added mentally, "and cut my throat.""A brilliant soldier, and a brave one, is Captain Conway," continued\nFred, "and if he is given an opportunity to distinguish himself, it will\nnot be long before it will be Major or Colonel Conway."This praise pleased Miss Alice greatly, and she informed Fred that he\nwould soon have the pleasure of meeting his friend; that she expected\nhim every moment.Fred moved somewhat uneasily in his chair.He had no desire to meet\nCaptain Conway, and he was about to make an excuse of going out to see\nhow his horse was standing, when they were startled by the old <DW64>\nrunning toward the house and yelling at the top of his voice: "Massa,\nmassa, yo\' hoss is gittin\' away."The sly old fellow had thrown a stone at Prince, and the horse was\nrearing and plunging.Fred dashed out of the house; a party of horsemen was coming up the\nroad, in fact, was nearly to the house.It was but the work of a moment\nfor Fred to unhitch his horse and vault into the saddle, but the party\nwas now not more than fifty yards away.They had noticed the horse hitched at the gate, and were coming at full\nspeed to try and surprise the owner.The moment Conway saw Fred he knew\nhim.he cried, "Fred Shackelford, what luck!"and snatched a pistol\nfrom the holster and fired.The ball whistled past Fred\'s head\nharmlessly, and he turned in the saddle and returned the fire.It was\nthe first time he had ever shot at a man, and even in the heat of\nexcitement he experienced a queer sensation, a sinking of the heart, as\nthough he were committing a crime.Fairly and squarely the ball from his revolver struck the horse of\nCaptain Conway in the forehead, and the animal fell dead, the rider\nrolling in the dust.His men stopped the pursuit, and,\ndismounting, gathered around the captain, thinking he was killed.But he sprang to his feet, shouting: "A hundred dollars to the one who\nwill take that young devil, dead or alive.Here, Corporal Smith, you\nhave a fleet horse, let me take him," and jumping into the saddle, he\nwas in pursuit, followed by all his men, except Corporal Smith, who\nstood in the road looking after them.asked the two ladies, who stood\non the veranda, wringing their hands, and very much excited."Blamed if I know," answered the corporal."The sight of that young chap\nseemed to make the captain kinder crazy.The moment he caught sight of\nhim, he called him by name, and banged away at him.""You say the captain called him by name?""Well, he said he knew the captain, and that he was one of his best\nfriends.The corporal had no explanation to offer, so went and took a look at the\ncaptain\'s horse.In the meantime the pursued and the pursuers had passed out of sight up\nthe road, enveloped in a cloud of dust."Remember, boys," shouted Conway, "a hundred dollars to the one who\nbrings him down.But it was nothing but play for Fred to distance them, and he laughed to\nthink that they expected to catch him.But the laugh suddenly died on\nhis lips; he turned pale, and glanced hurriedly to the right and left.A\nhigh rail fence ran on each side of the road.The scouting party of\nwhich the <DW64>s spoke was returning.Captain Conway saw the other party, and shouted in triumph."Now, boys, we have him," and he spurred his horse forward, revolver in\nhand.There was a look of malignant hatred on his face, and he muttered:\n"Now, my boy, I will settle scores with you.I shall never take you back\nto camp.\'Captured a spy, killed while trying to escape.\'As for Fred, even in his extremity, his courage or his presence of mind\nnever deserted him.He felt that to be captured by Conway was death, for\nhad not the captain sworn to kill him on sight?His mind was made up; he\nwould wheel and charge the captain\'s party.Just as he was about to do this, he espied an opening in the\nfence on the left.As quick as thought he dashed through it, thinking it\nmight afford a chance of escape.The field\nwas a perfect cul-de-sac, bounded on all sides by a high rail fence, the\nonly opening the one he had come through.Through this opening the enemy poured, and when they saw the trap which\nFred had entered, their shouts made the welkin ring.Their shouts rang in Fred\'s ears like the tolling of a\nfuneral bell.So must the bay of hounds sound in the ears of the hunted\nquarry.It was built of heavy rails, and\nfull seven feet high.Bending over his horse\'s\nneck, Fred said: "Prince, it is a question of life or death.Do your\nbest, old fellow; we can but fail."With\ndistended nostrils, eyes flashing with excitement, and every muscle\nquivering, he gathered himself for the mighty spring.As lightly as a\nbird he cleared the fence, staggered as he struck the ground on the\nother side, then on again like the wind.Fred turned in his saddle, and uttered a yell of defiance.But the hands of his troopers were unsteady,\nand the shots went wild.Before his men could dismount and throw down\nthe fence, Fred was beyond pursuit.Captain Conway fairly foamed at the\nmouth.He raved and swore like a madman."It\'s no use swearing, Captain," said a grizzled lieutenant."I thought\nI knew something about horses, but that beat any leap I ever saw.I would rather have the horse than the boy."']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The text does not mention Sandra at all. It talks about a scene where Fred is being chased by Captain Conway and his men, but there is no mention of Sandra's name or any character that could be related to her.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['It\'s a fine sight to see them start.Would you like to come and look at them?"He had turned back and was walking with us down the street, pointing\nout everything that occurred to him as noticeable, in the kindest and\ncivilest way.When we apologised for troubling him, and would have\nparted company, our friend made no attempt to go."Oh, I\'ve nothing at all to do, except"--he took out the biggest and\nmost respectable of watches--"except to attend a prayer-meeting at\nhalf-past six.I should have time to show you the town; we think it is\na very nice little town.I ought to know it; I\'ve lived in it, boy and\nman for thirty-seven years.But now I have left my business to my sons,\nand I just go about and amuse myself, looking into the shop now and\nthen just for curiosity.You must have seen my old shop, ladies, if you\ncame down that street."Which he named, and also gave us his own name, which we had seen over\nthe shop door, but I shall not record either.Not that I think the\nhonest man is ever likely to read such "light" literature as this book,\nor to recall the three wanderers to whom he was so civil and kind, and\nupon whom he poured out an amount of local and personal facts, which\nwe listened to--as a student of human nature is prone to do--with an\namused interest in which the comic verged on the pathetic.How large\nto each man seems his own little world, and what child-like faith he\nhas in its importance to other people!I shall always recall our friend\nat St.Ives, with his prayer-meetings, his chapel-goings--I concluded\nhe was a Methodist, a sect very numerous in Cornwall--his delight in\nhis successful shop and well-brought-up sons, who managed it so well,\nleaving him to enjoy his _otium cum dignitate_--no doubt a municipal\ndignity, for he showed us the Town Hall with great gusto.Evidently to\nhis honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes\nto get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a\npunctual man all my life, ma\'am," added he, half apologetically, till\nI suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had\nliked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final\npointing across the street, "There\'s my shop, ladies, if you would care\nto look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its\nancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but\nnight was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a\nmost untempting meal, and hurried Charles\'s departure, lest we should\nbe benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and\nunlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done\nour duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we\nlaughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that\nthe man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all\nthose notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH\n\n\nThe last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a\nstarless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael\'s Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,\nif after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,\nthe day on which we went to the Land\'s End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some\nof us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so\ntill the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out\non the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point\nof gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare\nenough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted\nfor the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering\nsun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last\ntime, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land\'s End would\nbe like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out\nthe truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead\nof a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through\nPenzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along\nto morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage\nto go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen\'s, which we knew\nby report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted\nwith had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised\nfaithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall\nnever forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely\nroads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about\nPenzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the\nhigh promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was\nnow all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer\nleaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three\nchildren trotting to school or church, with their books under their\narms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;\nreligious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist\nsects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church\nof England.Buryan\'s--a curious old church founded on the place where\nan Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A\nfew stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing\nspecial to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and\nsunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the\ncelebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in\nEngland of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,\nwho can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,\n  But all earth\'s powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant\nGoldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat\'s\ncrew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point\non which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at\ngreat labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked\nproperly since.By Charles\'s advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who\nstalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the\nLizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a\nlabyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You\'ll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of\nthem in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide\'s hand been\nmuch readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even\nso far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat\nanxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that\nenormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the\nlovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must\nhonestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones\naround it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most\nadventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain\nrelief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms\nbroken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land\'s End is said to be one\nof the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,\nPardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought\nto see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a\ndull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and\nugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of\na village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came\nforward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief\nexclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more\nwhen we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of\nan hour at the Land\'s End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too\ndaintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour\nof the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great\nBritain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a\nsympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It\'s very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our\ncontrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the\nhouse, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme\nend of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further\ninto the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things\ninnumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who\nis Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,\none seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to\ngo to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,\nshould spend a Sunday at the Land\'s End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for\ntwo mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a\nsunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand\nlonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best\nto finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what\nwe had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to\ncreep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective\napplicable to the Land\'s End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh\nwind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt\nthan any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one\'s nerves\nwere strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do\nanything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came\nforward--a regular man-of-war\'s-man he looked--we at once resolved to\nadventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was\naccustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I\'ll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but\nyou--" eying me over with his keen sailor\'s glance, full of honesty and\ngood humour, "you\'re pretty well on in years, ma\'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal\nyet."Oh, I\'ve taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was\nnearly seventy.So we\'ll do our best, ma\'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold\nby, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he\nguided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that\nis, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done\nfor," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of\nwaters below.[Illustration: THE LAND\'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the\nexploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have\nbeen bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one\ngrand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at\nthe farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that\nmagnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of\nLyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and\none, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to\nhim, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a\nscene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of\nSt.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly\nto walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long\nrambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under\nhis arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an\nexcellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from\nthe north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little\nlady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;\nand the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both\nas a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this\neternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We\nbade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,\ncautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of\nour guide."Yes, ladies, that\'s the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General\nArmstrong\'s horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor\nbeast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious\nthing.I wouldn\'t have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw\nit with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below\nthere--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of\nboiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen\nswimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a\ncuriosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and\nthe captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held\non there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;\nthe wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She\nwas pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst\nnot tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at\nWhitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember\nit well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But\nwhen he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,\n\'She saved my life, she saved my life,\' till he was taken away by his\nfriends.Look out, ma\'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped\nand broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the\nhotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who\nproceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,\nbut had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty\'s ship\n_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma\'am.I was in her off\nBalaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once\nso familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to\nbe almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I\ncame home invalided, and didn\'t attempt the service afterwards; but I\nnever thought I should come home at all.Yes, it\'s a fine place the\nLand\'s End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right\noff.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I\'m not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten\nface--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a\nfine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we\ngave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted\non our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone\nweighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,\nbut ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack\nand unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and\nI keep it still in remembrance of the Land\'s End, and of the honest\nsailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land\'s End no more.It\nbecame now a real place, of which the reality, though different from\nthe imagination, was at least no disappointment.John journeyed to the bathroom.How few people in\nattaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out\nour original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled\ndays they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have\nbeen glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the\ncarriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story\na friend had once told how, staying at Land\'s End, she crossed the bay\nalone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where\nshe was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care\nby a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey\'s end that he\nhad left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the\nbay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village\nhad become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,\nwhich was fast melting into night."We\'ll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a\ncomfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could\nfrom the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers\' burial\nground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the\nNine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting\nthings, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the\nrising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might\nbe, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land\'s End!It is in great things as in small, the\nworry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We\nhave done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH\n\n\nMonday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing\nthat by the week\'s end our travels must be over and done, and that if\nwe wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next\nmorning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which\ninvolved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable\ncarriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn\'t be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from\nhis ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,\nmaster will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like\nto-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,\nthen he\'ll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o\'clock\nto get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it\'s a good road, though\nrather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning\nmoon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,\nbut decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard\'s Head,\nLamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on\nno account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with\nscientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen\na single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of\nthat magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the\nday.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,\nand I couldn\'t get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn\'t trouble anybody very much, mightn\'t we go again to\nWhitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it\nin delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a\nrest for the next day\'s fatigue.there\nwould be no temptation to put on miners\' clothes, and go dangling in\na basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was\nreported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but\nsome of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper\nair.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no\ntime" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard\'s Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a\nsecond view of the Land\'s End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we\nmade various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never\nhad the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that\nwe could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone\nthrough England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always\nseemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient\nchurch and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me\nsome ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark\n"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,\nreleased for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,\nweighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling\nto their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of\nthe "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the\nvillage with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not\nhelp thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for\na large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the\ncarriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,\ngradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was\nalmost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking\nyourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a\nparadise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about\nlike sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,\nshallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed\nbefore reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious\none, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne\'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we\nquite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such\na splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,\nand the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary\nfigure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless\na human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal\nwisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,\nthe sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could\nnot last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched\nourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every\narm\'s-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I\nseen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very\nminute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin\'s head.The\ncollecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical\ninterests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King\nStephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have\nlanded here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over\nby Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite\ngreatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the\nexceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,\nwho can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a\nglow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in\ncreation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for\ndreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur\nof the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and\nbreaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed\nimpossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his\nwife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all\nhis other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the\nLand\'s End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful\nwe felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased\nto have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the\nArmed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make\nout which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some\nfragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a\nlittle group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable\nfarewell of the Land\'s End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled\nor thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it\nwas another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small\nboy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only\nunemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent\nair for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask\nhim to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But\nhe accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most\ngraphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,\nmaking a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with\ntwo moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own\naccord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a\ngroup of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me\nhow many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what\nhard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she\nliked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at\nSennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I\nhad parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in\ntime to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus\nbelli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser\npeople can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the\nstrong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and\nput an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore\nsum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent\nreason that I couldn\'t do it myself!)Therefore I\nconclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as\ntheir fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to\nPenzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for\nthe swarm at the Land\'s End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence\nhere must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are\nhappy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an\nequally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was\nquite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of\nMarazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign\nprincess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an\ninterest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,\nwith the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,\na year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von\nPawel-Rammingen, her father\'s secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval\nknight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael\'s\nMount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half\nthe town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured\nevery available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,\nthe two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which\nwere supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest\ncuriosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the\nSt.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the\nLand\'s End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in\na grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see\nanything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,\nno doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long\nsometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and\ndown Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or\neven a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,\nso we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in\nthe lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging\nfor to-morrow\'s flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady\nas to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter\nmight drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this\none little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during\nall the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not\nliving--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And\nfinally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite\nmournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I\'ll\nwait till the moons up, and that\'ll help us.We\'ll get into Falmouth\nby daylight.I\'ve got to do the same thing often enough through the\nsummer, so I don\'t mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a\nhasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,\nnot meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date\nof writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly\ntill 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight\nof a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,\nand went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH\n\n\nInto King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,\nwhere he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one\nmay believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going\nto-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had\naccompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged\nall before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped\nto find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King\nMark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at\nan inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we\nleft behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the\nprettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed\nwith.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but\nin all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine\nscarcely ever failed us.Ives\nBay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded\ncountry near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the\nglittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then\ndarting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,\nthe little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its\nrepresentative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the\nancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to\nchange from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,\ntill we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;\na huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of\naccommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact\nlittle machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled\nourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather\nmore, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely\nquiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere\nrode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King\nArthur\'s death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,\n"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with\nthe "Morte d\'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better\nbriefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the\nedification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of\nthe duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel\nand Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto\nwhom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried\naway, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good\nknight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened\nArthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was\nrecognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead\nof Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round\nTable, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed\nvirtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married\nGuinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love\nof Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,\nhis best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a\nrebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his\nend was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry\nhim to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in\nthere his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,\nwho lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across\nthe mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was\nafterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still\nin fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order\nof Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will\nthen be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but\na very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country\ntowns; the same genteel linendrapers\' and un-genteel ironmongers\'\nshops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but\nsolid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and\ntheir backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of\nthese said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a\nmild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau\'s _Deerbrook_,\nor Miss Austen\'s _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they\nhave probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to\nrest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little\nriver Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King\nArthur\'s army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A\nslab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called\n"King Arthur\'s Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his\nRound Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,\nthe bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head\nof Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of\nDavidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is\ncalled "King Arthur\'s grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to\nchoose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and\nbelieve in Arthur\'s disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,\n\n  "To the island-valley of Avillion...\n  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a\nvirtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,\nwith the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend\nof Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his\ndwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to\nthe bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing\nround it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still\nlingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and\nhorses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;\nflitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human\nfoot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and\nwe might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash\nof the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;\nand pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la\nFaye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could\ndesire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,\npiled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them\nhills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever\nsince the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,\neverything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or\nother colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for\nvegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,\nthe result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful\natmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,\nsteam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back\nagain.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make\nthe little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the\nsaid tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a\nstreet, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old\npost-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were\namused to find we had to get ready for a _table d\'hote_ dinner, in\nthe only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,\na comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,\nserved us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and\npleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does\nnot always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,\nor Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights\nin the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway\nwhich now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to\nconfirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself\nand his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married\nto the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we\nthought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk\non the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning\nagainst a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the\nmany grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of\nTintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,\nthe sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear\namber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where\nsea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low\ncloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures\nsitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very\nmoderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long\nblack thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it\'s King\nArthur\'s luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and\nwent home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--\n\n\nAnd all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and\nnot spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished\nto stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all\nis--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,\nyet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love\nbetween two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered\nthat we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark\nand Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the\nbriefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch\nhome Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,\nher handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal\nresult; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where\nhe married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,\ntill, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he\nimplored to come to him.A tale--of which\nthe only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of\nthe second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern\npoets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly\nstory, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the\nscarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a\ncurious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just\nbecause he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand\nwrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should\never have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps\nTennyson\'s Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory\'s,\nfounded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all\nthe mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,\nhonour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of\nwoman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at\nthat hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the\ndays when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,\nall with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have\nexisted in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we\ncould not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining\ndown the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that\ngoodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from\nwhom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot\nclimb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite\ndirection to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks\nthe beam.While waiting for\nthe tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding\npath, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of\nrock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,\nourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down\ninto, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach\nthe shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not\ntourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the\nnarrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack\nover his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the\nleast notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted\neach to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK\'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,\nit was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove\nthree times a day.They all had their\nnames; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its\nlong ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young\nand some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of \'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a\nsort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for\nthat; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I\'d be glad to bring you\nsome, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we\nexplained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way\nto London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then\nbidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the\nbusy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He\nmight have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth\'s "Leech-gatherer\non the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall\ncertainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in\nthe afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at\nthe end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe\nshelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high\nfootpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of\nsea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and\nlegends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux\nCastle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells\nhad been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached\nthe cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe\nvoyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on\nboard--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter\nnights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the\ndepths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by\nminute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we\nmoralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people\nhave, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the\nAlmighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,\ndragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,\ninstead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious\nand even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely\nreconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we\ndrove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel\nblack in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,\nand there was nothing left but to\n\n  "Watch the twilight stars come out\n    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the\nbeach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin\'s feet\n"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was\nto grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were\nall about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly\nup the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and\ndescended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Sandra went back to the garden.Other\nruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King\nUther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful\nnatural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur\'s cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing\nin the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some\nholes in the slate rock."And up there you\'ll find the chapel.It\'s an\neasy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making\na verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the\nunknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for\noffence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on\nstill, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside\nit.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those\nlong-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,\nfought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it\ncan still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur\'s time.However,\nthere are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys\nso much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is\na great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost\nanything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one\nobvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,\nseawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed\nto behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate\nformation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of\nthe tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,\nand gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become\nsea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it\ndoes still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and\nactual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of\nTintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into\nan island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,\nYgrayne\'s husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin\nfortresses were habitable till Elizabeth\'s time, there is evidence to\nprove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep\nand the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in\nwhose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the\nfamiliar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two\ntame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about\nin a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough\nor a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and\nscream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky\nhollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron\ngate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel\nwe found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves\nbeyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had\nfound in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one\'s grasp of life, the greater is\none\'s longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this\nwonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves\nonce more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John\nCurgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby\nwaves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat\nwent dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there\'s some sea on, there always is here, but we\'ll be through it\npresently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied\nhis oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all\nthe while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,\nunless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had\nto be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts\nof the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click\nof their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in\nsummer.In winter--\n\n"Oh, they\'re used to it; we\'re all used to it," said our man, who was\nintelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a\ntime I\'ve got sea-fowls\' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a\ncliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The\ngentry buy them, and we\'re glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;\nbut one must earn one\'s bread, and it\'s not so bad when you take to it\nyoung."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds\'\neggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea\'s down a bit, as I said.Hold on,\nmate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out\nof daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking\non a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow\nthat it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;\nwhile beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of\nthe everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from\nwhich no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don\'t like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn\'t we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to\nreturn; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,\ncompared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as\nnothing.Yet with its\nterror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two\nminutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into\ndaylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic\noverhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world\nshall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself\non my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not\nto regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see\nit, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in\nquiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building\ndating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,\nand with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude\nHaven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild\nSeptember sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited\ncountry which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of\nit, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round\nand pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about\nhalf-a-mile off."There, ladies, that\'s King Arthur\'s grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied\nrecords of the hero\'s last resting-place remind one of the three heads,\nsaid to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little\nboy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur\'s\ncountry is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it\nalone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of\nTintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the\nbright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in\nshort, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian\nlegend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of\nbarbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere\nidea of such a hero as that ideal knight\n\n  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:\n  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:\n  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:\n  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"\n\nrises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the\ndescendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died\namong us in this very nineteenth century--\n\n  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"\n\nif this could be--what a blessing for Arthur\'s beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L\'ENVOI\n\n\nWritten more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have\nlong been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,\nchoking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent\ndays, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our\nUnsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,\nlike Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,\nmay see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,\nmay see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would\ncall "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far\nforward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:\n  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,\n  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C."What is your idea about the way they happened to come there, based on\nwhat you have learned since?""Well, it is a very simple idea," returned the sprite."You know when a\nsuspender button comes off it always disappears.Of course it must go\nsomewhere, but the question is, where?No one has ever yet been known to\nrecover the suspender button he has once really lost; and my notion of\nit is simply that the minute a metal suspender button comes off the\nclothes of anybody in all the whole universe, it immediately flies up\nthrough the air and space to Twinkleville, which is nothing more than a\nhuge magnet, and lies there until somebody picks it up and tries to sell\nit.I remember as a boy sweeping our back yard clear of them one\nevening, and waking the next morning to find the whole place covered\nwith them again; but we never could make money on them, because the moon\nwas our sole market, and only the best people of the moon ever used\nsuspenders, and as these were unfortunately relatives of ours, we had to\ngive them all the buttons they wanted for nothing, so that the button\ncrops became rather an expense to us than otherwise.But with soda-water\nit was different.Everybody, it doesn\'t make any difference where he\nlives, likes soda-water, and it was an especially popular thing in the\nmoon, where the plain water is always so full of fish that nobody can\ndrink it.But as I said before, often the stage-coach wouldn\'t or\ncouldn\'t stop, and we found ourselves getting poorer every day.Finally\nmy father made up his mind to lease, and move into this new star, sink a\nhalf-dozen soda-water wells there, and by means of a patent he owned,\nwhich enabled him to give each well a separate and distinct flavor,\ndrive everybody else out of the business.""You don\'t happen to remember how that patent your father owned worked,\ndo you?"asked the major, noticing that Jimmieboy seemed particularly\ninterested when the sprite mentioned this."If you do, I\'d like to buy\nthe plan of it from you and give it to Jimmieboy for a Christmas\npresent, so that he can have soda-water wells in his own back yard at\nhome.""No, I can\'t remember anything about it," said the sprite."Nine\nthousand years is a long time to remember things of that kind, though I\ndon\'t think the scheme was a very hard one to work.For vanilla cream,\nit only required a well with plain soda-water in it with a quart of\nvanilla beans and three pints of cream poured into it four times a week;\nsame way with other flavors--a quart of strawberries for strawberry,\nsarsaparilla for sarsaparilla, and so forth; but the secret was in the\npouring; there was something in the way papa did the pouring; I never\nknew just what it was.But if you don\'t stop asking questions I\'ll never finish my story.""You shouldn\'t make it so interesting if you don\'t want us to have our\ncuriosity excited by it," said Jimmieboy."I\'d have asked those\nquestions if the major hadn\'t."Well, we moved, and in a very short time were comfortably settled in\nthe suburban star I have mentioned," continued the sprite.John went to the bedroom."As we\nexpected, my father grew very, very rich.He was referred to in the moon\nnewspapers as \'The Soda-water King,\' and once an article about him said\nthat he owned the finest suspender-button mine in the universe, which\nwas more or less true, but which, as it turned out, was unfortunate in\nits results.Some moon people hearing of his ownership of the\nTwinkleville Button Mines came to him and tried to persuade him that\nthey ought to be worked.Father said he didn\'t see any use of it,\nbecause the common people didn\'t wear suspenders, and so didn\'t need the\nbuttons."\'True,\' said they, \'but we can compel them to need them, by making a\nlaw requiring that everybody over sixteen shall wear suspenders.\'"\'That\'s a good idea,\' said my father, and he tried to have it made a\nlaw that every one should wear suspenders, high or low, and as a result\nhe got everybody mad at him.The best people were angry, because up to\nthat time the wearing of suspenders had been regarded as a sign of noble\nbirth, and if everybody, including the common people, were to have them\nthey would cease to be so.The common people themselves were angry,\nbecause to have to buy suspenders would simply be an addition to the\ncost of living, and they hadn\'t any money to spare.In consequence we\nwere cut off by the best people of the moon.Nobody ever came to see us\nexcept the very commonest kind of common people, and they came at night,\nand then only to drop pailfuls of cod-liver oil, squills, ipecac, and\nother unpopular things into our soda-water wells, so that in a very\nshort time my poor father\'s soda-water business was utterly ruined.People don\'t like to order ten quarts of vanilla cream soda-water for\nSunday dinner, and find it flavored with cod-liver oil, you know.""Yes, I do know," said Jimmieboy, screwSandra moved to the bathroom.']
