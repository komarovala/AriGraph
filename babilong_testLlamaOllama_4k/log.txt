EPISODIC MEMORY: ['[56] This would,\nin my opinion, be the course to follow during the south-west monsoon,\nwhile during the north-east monsoon there is usually so much rain that\nneither the salt river nor the water mills would be required, while\nmoreover during that time there is little danger of an attack.These\nthree plans being adopted, the banks of the moat could be protected by\na wall of coral stone to prevent the earth being washed away by the\nwater, as the present rocky bed of the moat is sufficiently strong\nto serve as a foundation for it.The moat has already been dug to\nits proper breadth, which is 10 roods.In my opinion there are two other defects in this Castle: the one\nis as regards the embrazures, the other is in the new horse stable\nand carpenters\' yard, which are on the south side just outside the\nopposite bank of the moat.I think these ought to be altered, for\nthe reasons stated in our letter to Colombo of November 30, 1695.I\nwas however opposed by the Constable-Major Toorse in his letter of\nDecember 16 next, and his proposal was approved in Batavia by letter\nof July 3 following.Sandra moved to the kitchen.This work will therefore have to remain as it is,\nalthough it appears that we did not explain ourselves sufficiently;\nbecause Their Excellencies seem to think that this yard and stable\nwere within the knowledge of His Excellency van Mydregt.John travelled to the kitchen.It is true\nthat the plan for them was submitted to His Excellency, as may be seen\nfrom the point submitted by the late Mr.Blom on February 17, 1692,\nand April 29, 1691, but no answer was ever received with regard to\nthis matter, on account of the death of His Excellency van Mydregt,\n[57] and I have an idea that they were not at all according to his\nwish.However, the yard and stable will have to remain, and with\nregard to the embrazures the directions of the Constable-Major must\nbe followed.If it be recommended that the deepening of the moat is possible\nwithout danger to the fort, and if the plan of the water mills and\nbanks be not approved, so that a dry moat would have to suffice,\nI think the outer wall might be completed and the ground between\nthe rocks be sown with a certain kind of thorn called in Mallabaar\nOldeaalwelam and in Dutch Hane sporen (cock spurs), on account of\ntheir resemblance to such spurs in shape and stiffness.This would\nform a covering of natural caltrops, because these thorns are so sharp\nthat they will penetrate even the soles of shoes, which, besides,\nall soldiers in this country do not wear.Another advantage in these\nthorns is that they do not easily take fire and do not grow higher\nthan 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the ground, while the plants grow in quite\na tangled mass.I thought it might be of some use to mention this here.The present bridge of the fort is built of palmyra wood, as I found\non my arrival from Batavia; but as the stone pillars have already\nbeen erected for the construction of a drawbridge, this work must be\ncompleted as soon as the timber that I ordered from the Wanni for this\npurpose arrives.In the carpenters\' yard some timber will be found that\nwas prepared three years ago for the frame of this drawbridge, which,\nperhaps, could yet be utilized if it has been well preserved.This\nwork will have to be hurried on, for the present bridge is dangerous\nfor anything heavy to pass over it, such as elephants, &c. It will\nalso be much better to have a drawbridge for the fortification.The\nbridge must be built as broad as the space between the pillars and\nthe opposite catches will permit, and it must have a strong wooden\nrailing on either side, which may be preserved for many years by\nthe application of pitch and tar, while iron is soon wasted in this\ncountry unless one always has a large quantity of paint and linseed\noil.Yet, an iron railing is more ornamental, so I leave this matter\nto Your Honours.[51]\n\nThe fortress Hammenhiel is in good condition, but the sand bank\nupon which it is built has been undermined by the last storm in the\nbeginning of December during the north-east monsoon.Sandra journeyed to the office.The damage must\nbe remedied with stones.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.In this fortress a reservoir paved with\nDutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,\nbut it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets\nand may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in\nmy letter to Colombo of September 8, 1694.As this is a new work it\nwill have to remain as present, until such time as alterations can\nbe made.The ramparts of this fortress, which are hollow, have been\nroofed with beams, over which a floor of stone and chunam has been\nlaid, with a view to the space below being utilized for the storing\nof provisions and ammunition.This is a mistake, as the beams are\nliable to decay and the floor has to support the weight of the canon,\nso that there would be danger in turning the guns round for fear of\nthe floor breaking down.So far back as the time of Commandeur Blom\na beginning was made to replace this roof by an entire stone vault,\nwhich is an important work.The gate of the fortress, which is still\ncovered with beams, must also be vaulted.[52]\n\nPonneryn and the passes Pyl, Elephant, and Buschutter only\nrequire a stone water tank, but they must not be as high as that of\nHammenhiel.Dutch bricks were applied for from Jaffnapatam on February\n17, 1692, and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo\npromised to send them here as soon as they should arrive from the\nFatherland, so that Your Honours must wait for these.Ponneryn is\nnot so much in want of a reservoir, as it has a well with fairly good\ndrink water.[53]\n\nThe work that demands the chief attention in Manaar is the deepening\nof the moat, as the fortifications, dwelling houses, and stores are\ncompleted.But since this work has to be chiefly carried out by the\nCompany\'s slaves, it will take some time to complete it.There are\nalso several elevations near the fort which will have to be reduced,\nso that they may not at any time become a source of danger.During\nmy circuit on two or three occasions the Opperhoofd and the Council\nat Manaar applied for lime to be sent from here, as no more coral\nstone for the burning of lime was to be found there.This takes\naway the Company\'s sloops from their usual employment, and the\nofficials have been informed that they must get the lime made\nfrom the pearl shells which are found in abundance in the bay of\nCondaatje as remains of the fishery.Daniel travelled to the garden.John moved to the hallway.It makes very good lime, and\nthe forests in the neighbourhood provide the fuel, and the lime can\nthen be brought to Manaar in pontons and tonys.Information on this\nsubject may be found in the correspondence between this station and\nJaffnapatam.Care must be taken that the lime of the pearl shells\nis used for nothing but the little work that has yet to be done in\nthe fort, such as the pavements for the canons and the floors of the\ngalleries in the dwelling houses.The Opperhoofd and other officers\nwho up to now have been living outside the fort must now move into\nit, as there are many reasons why it is undesirable that they should\nreside outside--a practice, besides, which is against the Company\'s\nrules with regard to military stations in India.(54)\n\nProvisions and ammunition of war are matters of foremost consideration\nif we desire to have our minds at ease with regard to these stations,\nfor the one is necessary for the maintenance of the garrison and the\nofficials, while the other is the instrument of defence.These two\nthings ought at all times to be well provided.His late Excellency\nvan Mydregt for this reason very wisely ordered that every station\nshould be stocked with provisions for two years, as may be seen in\nthe letter sent from Negapatam bearing date March 17, 1688.This is\nwith regard to the Castle, but as regards the outstations it will be\nsufficient if they are provided with rice for six or eight months.On\naccount of the great expense the Castle has not of late been provided\nfor two years, but this will soon be changed now that the passage to\nTrincomalee and Batticaloa has been opened, even if the scarcity in\nCoromandel should continue, or if the Theuver should still persist in\nhis prohibition of the importation of nely from Tondy.I have heard,\nhowever, that this veto has been withdrawn, and that vessels with this\ngrain will soon arrive here.If this rumour be true and if a good\ndeal of rice is sent here from Cotjaar, Tammelegan, and Batticaloa,\na large quantity of it might be purchased on behalf of the Company\nwith authority of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of\nColombo, which might be obtained by means of our sloops.Perhaps\nalso the people of Jaffnapatam who come here with their grain may be\nprevailed upon to deliver it to the Company at 50 per cent.or so\nless, as may be agreed upon.This they owe to their lawful lords,\nsince the Company has to spend so much in governing and protecting\nthem.Sanction to this measure was granted by His Excellency van\nMydregt in his letter from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of June 12, 1688,\nwhich may be looked up.If a calculation be made of the quantity of\nprovisions required for two years, I think it would be found that it\nis no less than 300 lasts of rice a year.This includes provisions\nfor the garrison and those who would have to come into the fort in\ncase of a siege, so that 600 lasts would be required for two years,\na last being equal to 3,000 lb.or 75 Ceylon parras, thus in all\n45,000 parras.At the rate of one parra per month for each person,\n1,875 people could be maintained for two years with this store of\nrice.This would be about the number of people the Company would\nhave to provide for in case of necessity, considering that there are\naccording to the latest regulations 600 Company\'s servants, while\nthere are according to the latest enumeration 1,212 women, children,\nand slaves in the town, making a total of 1,812 persons who have to be\nfed; so that the above calculation is fairly correct.Sometimes also\nManaar will have to be provided, because Mantotte does not yield a\nsufficient quantity of nely to supply that fort for two years.This\nmust also be included in the calculation, and if Your Honours are\nwell provided in this manner you will be in a position to assist some\nof the married soldiers, the orphanage, and the poor house with rice\nfrom the Company\'s stores in times of scarcity, and will be able to\nprevent the sale in rice being monopolized again.Daniel went back to the bedroom.It was the intention\nof His Excellency van Mydregt that at such times the Company\'s stores\nshould be opened and the rice sold below the bazaar price.Sandra went back to the office.Care must\nbe taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened\nthat some of the Company\'s servants sent natives on their behalf,\nwho then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This\nwas mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,\n1695.The Company can hardly have too much rice in store, for it can\nalways be disposed of with profit when necessary, and therefore I think\n600 lasts need not be the limit, so long as there is a sufficient\nnumber of vessels available to bring it.But as rice alone will not\nsuffice, other things, such as salt, pepper, bacon, meat, &c., must\nalso be considered.Salt may be obtained in sufficient quantities\nin this Commandement, but pepper has to be obtained from Colombo,\nand therefore this spice must never be sold or issued from the store\nhouses until the new supply arrives, keeping always 3,000 or 4,000\nlb.Daniel travelled to the hallway.Bacon and meat also have to be obtained from Colombo,\nand His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo were kind\nenough to send us on my verbal request ten kegs of each from Galle\nlast August by the ship "Nederland."But I find that it has become\nstale already, and it must be changed for new as soon as possible,\nwith authority of His Excellency and the Council, in order that it may\nnot go further bad.In compliance with the orders of His Excellency\nvan Mydregt in his letter of November 23, 1687, the old meat and\nbacon must be returned to Colombo, and a new supply sent here every\nthree or four years, the stale meat being supplied in Colombo to\nsome of the Company\'s vessels.But considering that His Excellency\nthe Governor and the Council of Colombo are not always in a position\nto supply Jaffnapatam with a sufficient quantity of meat and bacon,\nas there are so many other stations in Ceylon to be provided for,\nit would be well to keep in mind the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen\nthat in emergencies 1,000 or 1,200 cattle could be captured and kept\nwithin the fort, where they could be made to graze on the large plain,\nwhile as much straw from the nely would have to be collected as could\nbe got together to feed these animals as long as possible.This\nsmall loss the inhabitants would have to bear, as the Company has to\nprotect them and their lands, and if we are victorious a recompense\ncould be made afterwards.I would also advise that as much carrawaat\n[58] as could be found in the quarters of the Carreas, Palwelys,\n[59] and other fishermen should be brought into the fort; because\nthis dried fish makes a very good and durable provision, except\nfor the smell.The provision of arrack must also not be forgotten,\nbecause used moderately this drink does as much good to our people as\nit does harm when taken in large quantities.As I have heard so many\ncomplaints about the arrack here, as well as in Trincomalee, at the\npearl fishery, at Coromandel, &c., it is apparent that the Company is\nnot properly served in this respect.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.On this account also some arrack\nwas returned from Negapatam and the Bay of Condaatje.Henceforth\nno arrack must be accepted which has not been tested by experts,\nneither for storing in the warehouses nor for sending to the different\nstations, because at present I cannot say whether it is adulterated by\nthe people who deliver it to the Company or by those who receive it\nin the stores, or even by those who transport it in the sloops.With\nregard to the munitions of war, I think nothing need be stated here,\nbut that there is a sufficient stock of it, because by the last stock\ntaking on August 31, 1696, it appears that there is a sufficient\nstore of canons, gun-carriages, gunpowder, round and long grenades,\ninstruments for storming, filled fire bombs, caseshot-bags, martavandes\nfor the keeping of gunpowder, and everything that pertains to the\nartillery.The Arsenal is likewise sufficiently provided with guns,\nmuskets, bullets, native side muskets, &c. I would only recommend that\nYour Honours would continue to have ramrods made for all the musket\nbarrels which are still lying there, suitable timber for which may be\nfound in the Wanni.It is from there also that the boards are obtained\nfor gun-carriages.And as I found that some had not been completed,\nI think this work ought to be continued, so that they may be ready\nwhen wanted.No doubt His Excellency the Governor and the Council of\nColombo will be willing to send a sufficient quantity of pitch and\ntar for the preservation both of the sloops']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,\nwho gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at\nthe time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives\nhim the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,\nthe planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to\nhis power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England\nby his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan\'s\ndaughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed\ngeneration, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and\nleast any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him\nhereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my\ntreatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas\nDale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to\na theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,\ninstead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the\nflutterings of a too susceptible widower\'s heart are hidden under a\ngreat resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved\nentirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:\n\n"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make\nbetween God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the\ndreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men\'s hearts shall be\nopened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be\nnot to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking\nof so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man\'s weakness may\npermit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good\nof this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of\nGod, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge\nof God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so\nentangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even\nawearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on\nthis subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind\nand his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God\'s\ndispleasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange\nwives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good\ncircumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should\nthus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,\nher manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in\nall nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,\nI have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are\nwicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man\'s\ndistruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such\ndiabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and\nconsequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,\nwhether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious\nreason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:\n\n"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde\nanother, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest\nand strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,\nin a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions\nand sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe\nindured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,\nand carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a\ngood Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not\nindeavor to make her a Christian?Mary went to the bedroom.And these have happened to my greater\nwonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which\nin common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede\nforgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the\nremedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:\n\n"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I\nwas created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but\nto labour in the Lord\'s vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and\nincrease the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the\ngospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be\nreaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation\nin the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance\nof love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge\nof God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness\nto receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her\nowne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of\nso untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right\nway?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or\nuncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn\'t to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed\nup his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands\nof people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the\nsacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,\nand the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive\nhe vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men\'s\nactions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt\nmee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to\ngorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually\ninclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared\nconscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less\nfearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate\nan estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope\nbut one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in\nbirth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con\'tent.... But shall it\nplease God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill\nmy ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe\nappointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have\naccomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will\ndaily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to\nAmonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir\nThomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a\nreverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas\nwas carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on\nshore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best\nsort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not\nvalue her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would\nstill dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan\'s daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully\ninstructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good\nprogress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly\nconfessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is\nsince married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his\nletter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may\nperceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father\nand friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in\nthe church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will\nincrease in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She\nwill goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one\nsoule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date\nwith the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness\nof which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale\nit says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the\ndaughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English\nGentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her\ncountrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was\nbaptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground\nher in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,\nthen Rolfe\'s tender conscience must have given him another twist for\nwedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had\nceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure\nwork of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It\nis not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her\ndetention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate\nof the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,\nboth of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious\nsubjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,\nfor it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to\nLondon.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may\nsuppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to\nconvert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever\nmay have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor\nDale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED\n\nSir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet\nGovernor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the\nchange in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had\nbeen held in common by the company, and there had been no division of\nproperty or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime\nland was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began\nat once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the\ncolonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort\nto fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter\'s to spread vital\npiety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,\nagainst "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The\nTwo Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers\nthe charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,\nabandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable\nlabour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first\nsettling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these\naspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were\njails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision\nall brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a\nprivate he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States\nGeneral in 1611 granted him three years\' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and\nfrugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a\nsoldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some\ninjurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,\nhe pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for\nsettling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,\nthe Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the\nthree hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,\nthat not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and\ncrazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards\nwith credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in\n1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and\ndied in 1620 from the effects of the climate.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.He was twice married, and\nhis second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him\nand received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Why should you not wear rubber boots or\n          overshoes in the house?Why should you change under-clothing night and\n          morning?Where should the night-dress be placed in the\n          morning?What should be done with the bed-clothes?Name the four kinds of work about which you\n          have learned.How are the organs of the body kept at work?[Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around\nus.We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.You already know something about them, for you are using them all the\ntime.In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil.This\npupil is only a hole with a muscle around it.When you are in the light,\nthe muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all\nthe light you need through a small opening.When you are in the dark,\nthe muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.The pupils of the cat\'s eyes are very large in the dark.They want all\nthe light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.[Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]\n\nThe pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of\nsight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not\nbear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing\nwe see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that\nthe nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While\nwriting, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;\nthen the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good\ncare of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the\npupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light\nis too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: "Let us see\nwhich of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time."Then they foolishly began to look']

Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,\npublished in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully\nexplain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be\ntoo voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated\nthe hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.Daniel travelled to the office.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.HAMILTON FISH,\n                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from\n   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the\n   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I\n   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the\n   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the\n   following circumstantial report:\n\n   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at\n   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North\n   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of\n   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming\n   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department\n   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government\n   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition\n   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,\n   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to\n   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for\n   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in\n   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous\n   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward\n   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the\n   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the\n   earth\'s crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and\n   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English\n   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,\n   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the\n   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick\n   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great\n   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,\n   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of\n   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the\n   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the\n   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the\n   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board\n   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each\n   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few\n   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of\n   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie\n   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first\n   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;\n   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present\n   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so\n   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an\n   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of\n   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the\n   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the\n   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were\n   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the\n   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of\n   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated\n   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;\n   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,\n   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the\n   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of\n   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at\n   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the\n   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not\n   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific\n   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at\n   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them\n   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its\n   main characteristic.Daniel went back to the hallway.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,\n   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal\n   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant\n   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of\n   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being\n   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by\n   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe\n   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated\n   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very\n   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its\n   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten\n   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual\n   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly\n   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being\n   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner\n   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also\n   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this\n   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most\n   prominent:\n\n   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous\n   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial\n   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago\n   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most\n   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal\n   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a\n   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of\n   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt\n   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases\n   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the\n   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must\n   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,\n   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining\n   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been\n   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant\n   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this\n   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that\n   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,\n   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines\n   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one\n   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the\n   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the\n   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred\n   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at\n   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average\n   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in\n   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and\n   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an\n   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in\n   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one\n   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat\n   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree\n   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of\n   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when\n   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed\n   from a common source; and\n\n   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change\n   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less\n   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of\n   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and\n   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees\n   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of\n   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of\n   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could\n   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of\n   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful\ncontrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only\na portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:\n\n   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten\n   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone\n   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the\n   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise\n   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to\n   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that\n   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to\n   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive\n   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by\n   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.John travelled to the bathroom.Turbine wheels were built,\n   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the\n   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between\n   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet\n   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the\n   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the\n   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron\n   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred\n   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of\n   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two\n   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected\n   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron\n   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost\n   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['John travelled to the kitchen.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger\nin after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the\nfield, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant\nyoung friend,\n\n                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel\nFreddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed\nand breathless interest.George and Helen couldn\'t help jumping up off\ntheir seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when\nanything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful\nstory that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh\'s" and\n"ah\'s" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed\nZouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true\nstory of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had\nbeen read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang\nup once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,\nmayn\'t I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"Mary journeyed to the bathroom.cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a\npity it wasn\'t all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a\nlittle bird has whispered in my ear that \'Colonel Freddy\' was\nwonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more\nquestions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time\nthey paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg\nher to let them drive over to Mr.R----\'s place, and find out all about\nit.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at\nlast one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more\nstories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,\nwhich looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny\'s\ndaughter hasn\'t forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a\ndouble quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,\nforgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of\nlightning and began pummelling on his sister\'s door with both fists;\nshouting, "Come, get up!here\'s another Sock story for\nus!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen\'s\nstockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to\ntheir places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the\nwrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the\nwhole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored\nmaxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,\nperforming a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his\nfather opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down\nstairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to\nexamine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was\nagain a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read\n"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that\ndear \'Little White Angel.\'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother\'s commencing to read the\nfirst story, it was found to be called, "God\'s Pensioners;" and\ncommenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted\nto "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Leavitt\'s, the\npublishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock\nStories.*

if\nfascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little\ngals--\'specially when they\'re my own.""Yes, you be, and don\'t you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,\nthinking it a good joke."Well, it\'ll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we\'ll see\nwhat the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little\nbread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house\nwas responsible.When the meal was over she said:\n\n"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,\nand you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they\ncould be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed\nat the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Mary moved to the kitchen.Hugh Donovan\'s face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what\'s best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.John went back to the office.Her husband took it,\nand brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you\'ll feel it if you don\'t stop your howlin\'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you\'d come to your senses," he said, in a tone of\nsatisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as\nshe cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and\nhopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,\nand wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which\nat once drew the attention of Mrs."I can\'t help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip\nwith which her husband had threatened the child."I\'ll give ye something\nto cry for.""Oh, don\'t--don\'t beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won\'t unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart\nsinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs.John moved to the bathroom."Shure, if you\'ll be a good gal, I\'ll give you all the pleasure\nI can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged\nsun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the\nhouse, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her\nsupplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child\'s curiosity on\nher way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her\nsorrow."Shure it\'s my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink\nwhich prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become\nafraid of her new guardians.She felt\nsure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was\nDan to know where she was.The poor child\'s lips quivered, and she could\nhardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea\'s disappearance that he felt it\nnecessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her\nrecovery."I\'ll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake\nthinking of her, for it won\'t do any good."I didn\'t know how much I loved the dear child\ntill I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her\nagain."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up\nbright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won\'t have any time, Dan.Rogers,\ntelling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is\nto be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not\nfeel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how\nthe little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your\nmother broke her leg, and I didn\'t think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to\nbe of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and\ninterview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was\nabsent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying\na gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between\nEighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His\ncourage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that\na child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea\'s age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would\nhave saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan\nto himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been\nunobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve\nas he noted our hero\'s inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don\'t think\nyou\'ll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:\n\n"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite\nthe house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly\nafterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man\'s appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I\nbelieve his hair was brown"--Hartley\'s was black."I am sorry I can\'t\nremember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab\ndrove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,\n\'Drive to Harlem.\'"Sandra journeyed to the bathroom."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Sandra went back to the garden."That puts me on the right\ntrack."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me\nknow," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite\nyours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to\ndeceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of\nyour search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive\nintelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look\nafter you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while\nyou are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait\nthree weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had\none source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet\nVernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be\nseriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse\nto the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He\ndid not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of\nsuccess should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his\nchild\'s expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western\nadventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley\'s want of\ncharacter, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a\nhazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some\ngenuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of\nshares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a\nhundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a\ncorresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the\novertures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious\ninvestigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and\nhow well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was\nso satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in\ntrain.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful\naccomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously\nraised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man\nfrom Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as\ncollateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without\na doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars\nbetween them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary\nassistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It\'s a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he\nthought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is\nlikely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand\nof her.Mary went to the hallway.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a\nCunard steamer.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and\ndecided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good\nadvantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for\nsale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting\nsurprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed\nupon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it']
