QUESTION: Where is Mary?

ASSOCIATED SUBGRAPH: ['daniel, moved to, kitchen', 'john, travelled to, hallway', 'daniel, journeyed to, hallway', 'mary, went back to, bathroom', 'mary, went back to, kitchen', 'john, travelled to, office']
EPISODIC MEMORY: ['John travelled to the hallway.John travelled to the office.Mary went back to the kitchen.Mary went back to the bathroom.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Daniel moved to the kitchen.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find the most recent information about Mary's location. I see that there are two relevant facts about Mary: 'mary, went back to, bathroom' and 'mary, went back to, kitchen'. Since both facts have the same verb "went back to", I will consider the order of appearance in the text. The fact 'mary, went back to, kitchen' appears after 'mary, went back to, bathroom', so it is more recent.
Direct answer: kitchen

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find the most recent information about Daniel's location. Let me check the relevant facts... Ah, here it is! The last fact about Daniel says he moved to the office. However, there's another fact that says he went to the bathroom, but then he journeyed to the hallway and finally moved to the office. Since moving to a location usually implies a more permanent change than going or journeying, I'll rely on the most recent "moved" fact.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find information about John's location. I will look for sentences that mention John and a place he moved to. I found two relevant sentences: 'John went back to the hallway' and 'John travelled to the office'. Since 'went back' implies returning to a previous location, it is likely that John was in the hallway after being in another place. However, since there are no other mentions of John moving from the hallway again, I will consider this as his current location.

Direct answer: Hallway
