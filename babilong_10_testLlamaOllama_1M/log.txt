EPISODIC MEMORY: ['But they had\n got into the mood by then, and they rushed at me.You can imagine, I\n fled, and seized hold of the British Consul.I did think the British\n Empire would stand by me, but he would do nothing but laugh.And I\n found myself up in the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,\n hands under one and round one.They were so happy that I waved my hand\n to them, and they shouted and cheered.The unit is only annoyed that\n they had not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.Then they\n tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command there, because he was English,\n and the Consul for the same reason, and the captain of the transport\n because he had brought us out.We sang all the national anthems, and\n then they danced for us.It was a weird sight in the moonlight.Some\n of the dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me of our\n Highland flings.We went on till one in the morning--all the British\n colony, there.I confess, I was tired--though I did enjoy it.Captain\n Bevan’s good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected--simply “God bless\n you.” Mrs.Young, the Consul’s wife, Mrs.Kerr, both Russians, simply\n gave up their whole time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs.Kerr\n had _the whole unit_ to tea.I had lunch one day at the British Mess,\n and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.They all came out to dinner\n with us.‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way place, and\n seventy-five new faces was a God-send.Well, as I said before, they\n are the kindest set of people I ever came across.They brought us our\n bread, and changed our money, and arranged with the bank, and got us\n this train with berths, and thought of every single thing for us.‘NEARING ODESSA,\n      ‘_Sep.‘DARLING EVE,--We are nearing the second stage of our journey, and\n _they say_ we shall be in Odessa to-night.We have all come to the\n conclusion that a Russian minute is about ten times as long as ours.If we get in to-night we shall have taken nine days from Archangel;\n with all the lines blocked with military trains, that is not bad.All the same we have had some struggles, but it has been a very\n comfortable journey and very pleasant.The Russian officials all along\n the line have been most helpful and kind.A Serbian officer on board,\n or rather a Montenegrin, looked after us like a father.‘What we should have done without M. and Mme.Malinina at Moscow, I\n don’t know.They gave the whole afternoon up to us: took us to the\n Kremlin--he, the whole unit on special tramcars, and she, three of\n us in her motor.She has a beautiful\n hospital, a clearing one at the station, and he is a member of the\n Duma, and Commandant of all the Red Cross work in Moscow.We only had\n a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to make one want to see more.I\n carried away one beautiful picture to remember--the view of Moscow in\n the sunset light, simply gorgeous.‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.I am not\n sorry to have had these three weeks since we left to get the unit in\n hand.When M. Malinina said it was\n time to leave the Kremlin, and the order was given to “Fall in,” I was\n quite proud of them, they did it so quickly.It is wonderful even now\n what they manage to do.Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket.They were told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them\n peeled an apple with her teeth.They were told not to drink unboiled\n water, so they handed their water-bottles out at dead of night to\n Russian soldiers, to whom they could not explain, to fill for them,\n as of course they understood they were not to fill them from water on\n the train.I must say they are an awfully nice lot on the whole.We\n certainly shall not fail for want of energy.The Russian crowds are\n tremendously interested in them.--Ever your loving aunt,\n\n      ‘ELSIE.’\n\n      ‘RENI, _Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--We have left Odessa and are really off to our\n Division.We were told this is the important point in the war\n just now--“A Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is in command\n against us.He was in command at Krushinjevatz when we were taken\n prisoners.Every one says how anxiously they are looking out for us,\n and, indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us.We are two little\n field hospitals for a whole Division.Think if that was the provision\n for our own men.We saw the\n 2nd Division preparing in Odessa.Only from the point of view of the\n war, they ought to be looked after, but when one remembers that they\n are men, every one of them with somebody who cares for them, it is\n dreadful.I wish we were each six women instead of one.I have wired\n home for another Base Hospital to take the place of the British Red\n Cross units when they move on with the 2nd Division.The Russians are\n splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals, but you can\n imagine what the pressure is from their own huge armies.We had such\n a reception at Odessa.All the Russian officials, at the station, and\n our Consul, and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers.They had\n a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of Serbian soldiers to\n carry up our personal luggage, and most delightful quarters for us on\n the outskirts of the town in a sanatorium.We were the guests of the\n city while we were there.Odessa\n is immensely interested in us.We were told that the form of greeting\n while we were there was, “Have you seen _them_?” The two best things\n were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala performance at the\n opera.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something\n to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole\n house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing\n our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.‘DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow\n since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in\n three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it\n has been, Amy dear.You cannot imagine what war is just behind the\n lines, and in a retreat!--our second retreat, and almost to the same\n day.We evacuated Kragujevatz on the 25th of October last year.We\n evacuated Medgidia on the 22nd this year.On the 25th this year, we\n were working in a Russian dressing-station at Harshova, and were moved\n on in the evening.We arrived at Braila to find 11,000 wounded, and\n seven doctors--only one of them a surgeon.Am going back to Braila to do surgery.Have\n sent every trained person there.--Your loving sister,\n\n      ELSIE.‘_P.S._--We have had lots of exciting things too, and amusing things,\n and _good_ things.’\n\n      ‘ON THE DANUBE AT TULCEA,\n      ‘_Nov.‘DEAREST AMY,--I am writing this on the boat between Tulcea and\n Ismail, where I am going to see our second hospital and the transport.Admiral Vesolskin has given me a special boat, and we motored over\n from Braila.The Étappen command had been expecting us all afternoon,\n and the boat was ready.They were very amused to find that “the\n doctor” they had been expecting was a _woman_!‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at\n Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.They gave us a\n very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the\n _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the\n day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight\n hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we\n unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice\n hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck\n the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating\n rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being\n brought back five versts.Then we were told to\n send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the\n _personnel_.The whole country was covered with\n groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.Russians, Serbs, and\n Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through\n the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places\n the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were\n throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,\n being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way\n of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on\n to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head\n over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different\n stories of our groups.My special lot slept the first night on straw\n in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the\n next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in\n barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent\n the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in\n Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that\n place, and there we have been ever since.‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an\n officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official\n figures are 7000).They had been working thirty-six hours without\n stopping when we arrived.‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in\n their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the\n trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing\n I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were\n evacuated straight to Odessa.‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through\n everything, and game for any amount of work.‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever.I do hope the papers at\n home have realised what the 1st Division did, and how they suffered in\n the fight in the middle of September.General Genlikoffsky said to me,\n “_C’était magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros_”;--and another\n Russian: “We did not quite believe in these Austrian Serbs, but no one\n will ever doubt them again.”\n\n ‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder than ever of\n British women.I wish you could have seen trained Sisters scrubbing\n floors at Medgidia, and those strapping transport girls lifting the\n stretchers out of the ambulances so steadily and gently.I have told\n in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown brought the equipments\n through to Galatz.We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of\n radiators.We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a rather\n stupid Serbian officer.It is a comfort to feel you are all thinking\n of us.--Your loving sister,\n\n      ‘E.I.’\n\n      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN BETWEEN\n      ‘RENI AND ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING EVE,--Now we have got a hospital at Reni again, for badly\n wounded, working in connection with the evacuation station.We have\n got the dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are\n getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall have to overflow\n into the Expedition houses.I\n remember thinking Reni a most uninteresting place--crowds of shipping\n and the wharf all crammed with sacks.It was just a big junction like\n Crewe!‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not finished.One\n unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,\n though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought\n it was a mere continental foible.When the cold came I realised\n that there is some sense in this foible after all!We _cannot_ get\n the wards warm, notwithstanding extra stoves and roaring fires.The\n poor Russians do mind cold so much.But they don’t want to leave the\n hospital.One man whom I told he must have an operation later on in\n another hospital, said he would rather wait for it in ours.The first\n time we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men to go.‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we are using Russian\n Red Cross money, and he told us he had been told in Petrograd that\n the S.W.H.were beautifully organised, and the only drawback was\n the language.We have got a\n certain number of Austrian prisoners as orderlies, and most of them\n curiously can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable\n way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,\n twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we\n cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,\n and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem\n to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and\n telegraphed, and planned and made two journeys to Ismail, to try and\n get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it doesn’t go.‘What did happen over the change of Government?I do hope we have got\n the right lot now, to put things straight at home, and carry through\n things abroad.Remember it all depends on you people at home._The\n whole thing depends on us._ I know we lose the perspective in this\n gloomy corner, but there is one thing quite clear, and that is that\n they are all trusting to our _sticking_ powers.They know we’ll hold\n on--of course--I only wish we would realise that it would be as well\n to use our intellects too, and have them clear of alcohol.’\n\n      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,\n      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘You don’t know what a comfort it is on this tumultuous front, to\n know that all you people at home have just settled down to it, and\n that you’ll put things right in the long run.It is curious to feel\n how everybody is trusting to that.The day we left Braila, a Rumanian\n said to me in the hall, “It is England we are trusting to.She has\n got hold now like a strong dog!” But it is a bigger job than any of\n you imagine, _I_ think.But there is not the slightest doubt we shall\n pull it off.I am glad to think the country has discovered that it is\n possible to have an alternative Government.If it does not do, we must\n find yet another._To her little Niece, Amy M‘Laren_\n\n      ‘ON AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,\n      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING AMY,--How are you all?We have been very busy since we came\n out here: first a hospital for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a\n Rumanian hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz and\n Reni.In the very middle, by some funny mistake, we were sent flying\n right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,\n and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we\n left.I’ll tell you the name of the place when the war is over, and\n show it to you on the map.We saw the petrol tanks on fire as we came\n away, and the ricks of grain too.‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school.I don’t think the children\n in these parts are doing many lessons during the war, and that will\n be a great handicap for their countries afterwards.Perhaps, however,\n they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the\n crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able\n to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and\n pots and pans and pigs.‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,\n sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were\n little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as\n gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of\n carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what\n the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,\n is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have\n got to help these people, because they are having the worst of it.I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can use any number, and\n bandages.Blessings on you, precious\n little girl.--Your loving aunt,\n\n      ELSIE.’\n\n ‘I have had my meals with the Staff.Unfortunately, most of them\n speak only Russian, but one man speaks French, and another German.The man who speaks German is\n having English lessons from her.He picked up _Punch_ and showed _me_ YOU.So, I said “you.”\n He repeated it quite nicely, and then found another OU.“Though,”\n and when I said “though,” he flung up his hands, and said, “Why a\n practical nation like the English should do things like this!”’\n\n      ‘S.W.H.,\n      RENI, _March 5, 1917_.‘DARLING MARY,--We have been having such icy weather here, such\n snowstorms sweeping across the plain.One day I really thought the house would be cut off from the hospital.The unit going over to Roll was quite a sight, with the indiarubber\n boots, and peaked Russian caps, with the ends twisted round their\n throats.We should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been for\n the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,\n and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across\n the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The\n Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in\n seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I\n would not have missed it for anything.The hospital has only had about\n forty patients for some time, as there has been no fighting, and it\n was just as well when we were so short of wood.We collected them all\n into one ward, and let the other fires out.‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.Took off the\n men’s shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and beat the\n mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s food, and in the end\n stated we were _ochin chesté_ (very clean), and that the patients\n were well cared for medically and well nursed.All of which was\n very satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the orderlies\n was disgraceful, and so it was.I hadn’t realised they were my job.However, I told him next time he came he should not find one single\n louse.Laird and I have a nice snug little room together.That is one\n blessing here, we have plenty of sun.Very soon it will begin to get\n quite hot.I woke up on the 1st of March and thought of getting home\n last year that day, and two days after waking up in Eve’s dear little\n room, with the roses on the roof.Bless all you dear people.--Ever\n your loving aunt,\n\n      ‘ELSIE.’\n\n      ‘_March 23, 1917._\n\n ‘We have been awfully excited and interested in the news from\n Petrograd.We heard of it, probably long after you people at home\n knew all about it!It is most interesting to see how everybody is on\n the side of the change, from Russian officers, who come to tea and\n beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good) to the men in the wards.In any\n case they say we shall find the difference all over the war area.One\n Russian officer, who was here before the news came, was talking about\n the Revolution in England two hundred years ago, and said it was the\n most interesting period of European history.“They say all these ideas\n began with the French Revolution, but they didn’t--they began long\n before in England,” he thought.He spoke English beautifully, and had\n had an English nurse.He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and\n we wondered all the time whether he was thinking of changes in Russia\n after the war, but now I wonder if he knew the changes were coming\n sooner.‘Do you know we have all been given the St.Prince\n Dolgourokoff, who is in command on this front, arrived quite\n unexpectedly, just after roll call.The telegram saying he was coming\n arrived a quarter of an hour after he left!General Kropensky, the\n head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince arrived about two\n minutes after him.He went all over the hospital, and a member of\n his gilded staff told matron he was very pleased with everything.He decorated two men in the wards with St.George’s Medal, and then\n said he wanted to see us together, and shook hands with everybody and\n said, “Thank you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr.Laird’s was\n for service, as she had not been under fire.George’s Medal is a\n silver one with “For Bravery” on its back.Our patients were awfully\n pleased, and inpressed on us that it carried with it a pension of a\n rouble a month for life.We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate\n the occasion.‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital looked in its\n ordinary, and even I was _fairly_ satisfied.I tell the unit that\n they must remember that they have an old maid as commandant, and must\n live up to it!I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled\n sheets.One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter home: “Our\n C.M.O.is an idealist!” I thought that was rather sweet; I believe she\n added, “but she does appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate\n hers.She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is one of the\n thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the hospital.We put up\n “Icons” in each of the four wards.The Russians are a very religious\n people, and it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them.The\n priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came in his long grey\n cloak.The two wards open out of one another, so he held the service\n in one, the men all saying the responses and crossing themselves.The\n four icons lay on the table before him, with three lighted candles at\n the inner comers, and he blessed water and sprinkled them, and then he\n sprinkled everybody in the room.The icons were fixed up in the corner\n of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn in front of them, as\n they always have them.We are going to have the evening hymn sung\n every evening at six o’clock.I heard that first in Serbia from those\n poor Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.The night nurses come up from the\n village literally wet through, having dragged one another out of mud\n holes all the way.Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to us.I have made Vera\n Holme master of the horse.‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters who have\n returned from Odessa.There is a great rivalry between the Armoured\n Car men and the British Red Cross men, about the capabilities of\n their Sisters.(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!)man said their Sisters were so smart they got a man on to the\n operating-table five minutes after the other one went off.Said an\n Armoured Car man: “But that’s nothing.The Scottish Sisters get the\n second one on before the first one is off.” The other story runs that\n there was some idea of the men waiting all night on a quay, and the\n men said, “But you don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?”\n I have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made them work all\n night.’\n\n      ‘RENI, _Easter Day, 1917_.‘We, all the patients, sick and wounded, belonging to the Army and\n Navy, and coming from different parts of the great, free Russia, who\n are at present in your hospital, are filled with feelings of the\n truest respect for you.We think it our duty as citizens on this\n beautiful day of Holy Easter to express to you, highly respected and\n much beloved Doctor, as well as to your whole Unit, our best thanks\n for all the care and attention you have bestowed upon us.We bow low\n and very respectfully before the constant and useful work which we\n have seen daily, and which we know to be for the well-being of our\n allied countries.‘We are quite sure that, thanks to the complete unity of action of\n all the allied countries, the hour of gladness and the triumph of the\n Allied arms in the cause of humanity and the honour of nations is near.‘_Vive l’Angleterre!_\n\n      ‘Russian Soldiers, Citizens, and the Russian Sister,\n      ’VERA V. DE KOLESNIKOFF.’\n\n      ‘RENI, _March 2, 1917_.‘DARLING EVE,--Very many thanks for the war prayers.The Archbishop’s prayers that I wanted are the\n original ones at the beginning of the war.Just at present we are\n very lucky as regards the singing, as there are three or four capital\n voices in the unit.We have the service at 1.30 on Sunday.That lets\n all the morning work be finished.I do wonder what has become of Miss\n Henderson and the new orderlies!We want them all\n so badly, not to speak of my cool uniform.That will be needed very\n soon I think.We are having\n glorious weather, so sunny and warm.All the snow has gone, and the\n mud is appalling.I thought I knew the worst mud could do in Serbia,\n but it was nothing to this.We have made little tiled paths all about\n our domain, and keep comparatively clean there.I wish we could take\n over the lot of buildings.The other day I thought I had made a great\n score, and bought two thousand poud of wood at a very small price.It\n was thirty-five versts out.We got the Cossacks to lend us transport.But the transport stuck in the mud, and came back the next day, having\n had to haul the empty carts out of mud holes by harnessing four horses\n first to one cart and then to another.It was no wonder I got the wood\n so cheap.‘_April 18, 1918._\n\n ‘I am writing this sitting out in my little tent, with a glorious\n view over the Danube.We have pitched some of the tents to relieve\n the crowding in the house.They are no longer beautiful and white, as\n they were at Medgidia.We have had to stain them a dirty grey colour,\n so as to hide them from aeroplanes.Yesterday, we had an awful gale,\n and a downpour of rain, and the tents stood splendidly, and not a\n drop of water came through.Miss Pleister and the Austrian orderly\n who helped her to pitch them are triumphant.Do get our spy-incident,\n from the office.We had an awful\n two days, but it is quite a joke to look back on.The unit were most\n thoroughly and Britishly angry.But I very soon saw\n the other side, and managed to get them in hand once more.General\n Kropensky, our chief, was a perfect brick.The armoured car section\n sent a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him, and he came\n off at once.He talks perfect English, and he has since written me a\n charming letter saying our _sang-froid_ and our _savoir-faire_ saved\n the situation.I am afraid there was not much _sang-froid_ among us,\n but some of us managed to keep hold of our common sense.As I told\n the girls, in common fairness they must look at the other side--spy\n fever raging, a foreign hospital right on the front, and a Revolution\n in progress.I told them, even if they did not care about Russia, I\n supposed they cared about the war and England, and I wondered what\n effect it would have on all these Russian soldiers if we went away\n with the thing not cleared up, and still under suspicion.After all,\n the ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England, except in\n the very concrete form of _us_.We should have played right into the\n devil’s hands if we had gone away.Of course, they saw it at once,\n and we stuck to our guns for England’s sake.The 6th Army, I think,\n understands that England, as represented by this small unit, is keen\n on the war, and does not spy!We have had a telegram from the General\n in command, apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.And the men from all regiments round come up to the out-patients’\n department, and are most grateful and punctiliously polite.You know the Russian greeting\n on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,” and the answer, “He is risen\n indeed.” We learnt them both, and made our greetings in Russian\n fashion.On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.The church was crowded with soldiers--very\n few women there.They were most reverent and absorbed outside in the\n courtyards.It was a very curious scene; little groups of people with\n lighted candles waiting to get in.Here, we had a very nice Easter\n service.My “choir” had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang\n the Magnificat.One of the armoured car men, on his way from Galatz\n to Belgrade, stayed for the service, and it was nice to have a man’s\n voice in the singing.Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.Our patients are\n delightful, the hospital in good order.The Steppe is a fascinating\n place to wander over, the little valleys, and the villages hidden\n away in them, and the flowers!We have been riding our transport\n horses--rather rough, but quite nice and gentle.We all ride astride\n of course.‘_On Active Service._\n\n      ‘To Mrs.FLINDERS PETRIE,\n      Hon.Sec., Scottish Women’s Hospitals.‘RENI, _May 8, 1917_.PETRIE,--How perfectly splendid about the Egyptologists.Miss Henderson brought me your message, saying how splendidly they are\n subscribing.That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had actually thought\n of coming out as an Administrator, and that you found you could not.I cannot tell you how splendid it would have been if you could have\n come.... I want “a woman of the world”... and I want an adaptable\n person, who will talk to the innumerable officers who swarm about this\n place, and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!‘I do wish you could see our hospital now.Such a nice story:--Matron was in Reni the other day, seeing the\n Commandant of the town about some things for the hospital, and when\n she came out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing round her\n house.They asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the\n Commandant was going to see about it.Whereupon the men said, “The\n Commandant must be told that the Scottish Hospital (_Schottlandsche\n bolnitza_) is the best hospital on this front, and must have whatever\n it wants.That is the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you\n recognise the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken Russia.We get on awfully well with the Russian soldier.Two of our patients\n were overheard talking the other day, and they said, “The Russian\n Sisters are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are good\n and not pretty.” The story was brought up to the mess-room by quite\n a nice-looking girl who had overheard it.But we thought we’d let\n the judgment stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”--though we _don’t_\n undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is\n delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am\n writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely\n place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and\n little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other\n night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another\n attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was\n finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers\n and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept\n through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How\n splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,\n _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,\n but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,\n the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the\n icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to\n Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,\n\n      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’\n\n      ‘_May 11, 1917._\n\n ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you\n dear people.But she did arrive\n with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and\n which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to\n Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the\n Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said\n he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the\n Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car\n yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the\n only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our\n Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know\n my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they\n think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very\n sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They\n are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that\n as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some\n little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for\n the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the\n most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village\n seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.But, when he\n got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior\n place!He wanders about with a Russian\n soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we\n hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,\n and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his\n dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his\n excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,\n ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,\n and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,\n he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not\n had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the\n wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him\n his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I\n ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled\n and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain\n to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who\n had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I\n got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared\n with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home\n is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother\n is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and\n he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s\n Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he\n does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the\n family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little\n brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud\n they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and\n been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;\n and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish\n Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for\n anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow\n hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I\n doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with\n tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe\n operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also\n a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is\n at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems\n rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to\n ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport\n horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all\n ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully\n uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past\n here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of\n us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly\n often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy\n them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It\n was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni\n the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came\n out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They\n asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant\n had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must\n be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that\n it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian\n soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the\n Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our\n hospital.’\n\n      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians\n and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are\n “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on\n us.I don’t believe we can disentangle\n it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing\n one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a\n habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’\n\n      ‘_July 15, 1917._\n\n ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that\n at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and\n Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had\n a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies\n brought it out.’\n\n      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front\n with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors\n and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most\n awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on\n having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at\n home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and\n so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There\n are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of\n them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;\n their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full\n and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were\n slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I\n don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was\n very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and\n said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many\n things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we\n had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from\n the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,\n who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe\n before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they\n recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’\n\n      ‘_Aug.28._\n\n ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for\n my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you\n were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it\n me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this\n telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not\n used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy\n returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,\n and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the\n Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting\n money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,\n and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun\n before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,\n a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve\n hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left\n hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they\n always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when\n there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,\n but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’\n\n      ‘S.W.H.,\n      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off\n in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this\n place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful\n camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question\n was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being\n back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,\n and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this\n turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day\n under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I\n mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due\n as a holiday, _which I am going to take_.I’ll see you all soon.--Your\n loving aunt,\n\n      ‘ELSIE.’\n\n_To Mrs.Simson_\n\n      ‘ARCHANGEL, _Nov.Have not been very well; nothing to worry about.Shall report in London, then come straight to you.‘INGLIS.’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE MOORINGS CUT\n\n    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’\n\n    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God\n    You plunged.This is not death,\n    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’\n\nThe reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London\nCommittee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that\nshe wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her\nand her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the\nmiddle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton\nwool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20\ngallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for\nMesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired\nasking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands\nfull, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their\nhelp would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And\nagain:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She\nsoon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in\nthe world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had\ntried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot\nbe argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia\ncreated disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in\nretreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by\nthe equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the\norderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of\nthe precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,\nwhen the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the\nequipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got\non a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to\nMiss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with\na refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and\nfinally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General\nPopovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without\nthose two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got\nthrough.’\n\nShe details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after\nthe despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to\nfall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and\nhelpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At\nthe station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a\ntalk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,\nand had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English\ncustoms.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going\non quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and\nhot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably\nabsurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England\nwas there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and\neverybody.’\n\nAs we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was\ngood of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--\n\n    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,\n      And type of all her race.’\n\nDr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She\nrefused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front\nwith her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to\n the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000\n strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the\n Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for\n twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having\n lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to\n have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to\n get under way.’\n\nIn the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she\nhas been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--\n\n ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign\n Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this\n lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’\n\nThere is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the\n unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble\n each, and good ones.’\n\nTo members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted\nfor many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,\nwhen for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on\nthe transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that\nSerbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of\nJohn Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--\n\n ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was\n off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,\n while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did\n in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away\n from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten\n miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For\n some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed\n in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few\n wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but\n her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own\n chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and\n was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him\n strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of\n this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became\n so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial\n to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained\n should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked\n first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always\n keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for\n picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up\n in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,\n wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required\n implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always\n so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally\n unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,\n and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not\n allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not\n share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was\n no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved\n for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was\n kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough\n for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the\n one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there\n were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of\n her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in\n her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred\n her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as\n he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his\n followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a\n lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity\n and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,\n she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt\n anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the\n weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and\n she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the\n news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was\n extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how\n she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority\n in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news\n arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover\n sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the\n Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two\n thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class\n compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was\n compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing\n every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the\n station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she\n suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could\n only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often\n found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her\n tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so\n with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she\n climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of\n the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on\n the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small\n cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was\n interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer\n very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she\n constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he\n died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set\n in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we\n reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,\n and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at\n Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for\n each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to\n say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with\n the deepest regret.Inglis\n had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning\n she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her\n standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face\n ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with\n the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers\n kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she\n said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’\n\nAs they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most\nof all, that they should see her face no more.’\n\n ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and\n arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for\n a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only\n whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we\n should meet soon in London.’\n\nAfter her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous\nyears, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms\nof the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and\nwar rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of\nthe One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story\nof Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat\n‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever\nswamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom\nof the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down\ntheir lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she\nremained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us\nto-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we\ngive thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to\nits dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the\nhigh courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils\nsurrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the\nmenace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,\nshe was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once\ndeath in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven\nfeet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her\ncaptain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas\nlaboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’\n\nIn her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on\nboard:--\n\n ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got\n into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,\n owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon\n us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings\n broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told\n me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they\n broke.”’\n\nThere was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she\nhad heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am\n going forth.’\n\nHer niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--\n\n ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in\n Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,\n but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by\n wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do\n not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night\n train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were\n at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did\n not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I\n found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to\n see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that\n I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured\n on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I\n know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been\n dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and\n we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and\n Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her\n living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now\n don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board\n ship nothing was possible.”\n\n ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the\n doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she\n at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand\n starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there\n are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this\n her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to\n her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how\n she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I\n knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was\n overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about\n bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an\n unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul\n in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she\n could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch\n straight with the War Office.”\n\n ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent\n work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”\n\n ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday\n evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two\n hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense\n of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong\n alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear\n in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us\n with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we\n could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I\n _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally\n and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a\n cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great\n experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is\n wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,\n and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if\n there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details\n for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting\n some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,\n she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We\n repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered\n back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,\n “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit\n her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”\n\n ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life\n beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many\n mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they\n watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only\n a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a\n glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one\n wish to follow after.”’\n\nAs ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome\nand show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not\nwell--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her\nmust be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless\nheaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news\nthat she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed\nthe bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds\nof those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her\nface once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,\nthat even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words\nthat she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one\nof us should go to her.’\n\nHer people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the\nhearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their\nstrong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active\nfeet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for\nthe last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and\nunderstood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed\naround her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The\nScottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of\ntheir hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the\nEast in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and\nSerbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by\nFrance, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad\nwhy she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It\nis not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect\nand recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of\nthe last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company\ngathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and\nrelatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the\nsocieties, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded\nat home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great\nthings abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people\nof Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders\nmilitary honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played\nas the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with\ntriumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and\npraise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of\nmany hearts in his farewell words:--\n\n ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to\n remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,\n Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for\n ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light\n of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever\n with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God\n and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage\n and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high\n devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of\n representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an\n immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that\n high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken\n land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated\n and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’\n\nThe buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking\nmorn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun\ncarriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited\nthe last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the\nshawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many\nanother of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot\nthe long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,\nDr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the\nLondon Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--\n\n      ‘_November 26, 1917._\n\n ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with\n explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel\n Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from\n Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible\n and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and\n whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make\n sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for\n they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their\n support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’\n\nHow the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the\ngrief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said\none to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’\n\nEdinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in\nthe living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the\nWater of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the\ngrave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives\nof the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place\nwhere the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story\nwas grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own\nnation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and\nsuffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the\nfortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which\nshe had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and\nleft her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by\nthe crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A.

you will thus be safe from the malice\nof the Stranglers, who would follow you hither to revenge the death of\ntheir chiefs, Providence having chosen you to deliver those three great\ncriminals to justice.Heaven will bless you!--Go and wait for me at the\ndoor of the governor\'s house; I will introduce you.The matter is so\nimportant that I do not hesitate to disturb him thus late in the night.Go quickly!--I will follow on my side."The steps of Mahal were distinctly audible, as he withdrew precipitately,\nand then silence reigned once more in the house.Joshua returned to his\ndesk, and hastily added these words to the despatch, which he had before\ncommenced:\n\n"Whatever may now happen, it will be impossible for Djalma to leave\nBatavia at present.You may rest quite satisfied; he will not be at Paris\nby the 13th of next February.As I foresaw, I shall have to be up all\nnight.--I am just going to the governor\'s.To-morrow I will add a few\nlines to this long statement, which the steamship \'Ruyter\' will convey to\nEurope."Having locked up his papers, Joshua rang the bell loudly, and, to the\ngreat astonishment of his servants, not accustomed to see him leave home\nin the middle of the night, went in all haste to the residence of the\ngovernor of the island.We now conduct the reader to the ruins of Tchandi.[5] This report is extracted from Count Edward de Warren\'s excellent work,\n"British India in 1831."--E.To the storm in the middle of the day, the approach of which so well\nserved the Strangler\'s designs upon Djalma, has succeeded a calm and\nserene night.The disk of the moon rises slowly behind a mass of lofty\nruins, situated on a hill, in the midst of a thick wood, about three\nleagues from Batavia.Long ranges of stone, high walls of brick, fretted away by time,\nporticoes covered with parasitical vegetation, stand out boldly from the\nsheet of silver light which blends the horizon with the limpid blue of\nthe heavens.Some rays of the moon, gliding through the opening on one of\nthese porticoes, fall upon two colossal statues at the foot of an immense\nstaircase, the loose stones of which are almost entirely concealed by\ngrass, moss, and brambles.The fragments of one of these statues, broken in the middle, lie strewed\nupon the ground; the other, which remains whole and standing, is\nfrightful to behold.It represents a man of gigantic proportions, with a\nhead three feet high; the expression of the countenance is ferocious,\neyes of brilliant slaty black are set beneath gray brows, the large, deep\nmouth gapes immoderately, and reptiles have made their nest between the\nlips of stone; by the light of the moon, a hideous swarm is there dimly\nvisible.A broad girdle, adorned with symbolic ornaments, encircles the\nbody of this statue, and fastens a long sword to its right side.The\ngiant has four extended arms, and, in his great hands, he bears an\nelephant\'s head, a twisted serpent, a human skull, and a bird resembling\na heron.The moon, shedding her light on the profile of this statue,\nserves to augment the weirdness of its aspect.Here and there, enclosed in the half-crumbling walls of brick, are\nfragments of stone bas-reliefs, very boldly cut; one of those in the best\npreservation represents a man with the head of an elephant, and the wings\nof a bat, devouring a child.Nothing can be more gloomy than these ruins,\nburied among thick trees of a dark green, covered with frightful emblems,\nand seen by the moonlight, in the midst of the deep silence of night.Against one of the walls of this ancient temple, dedicated to some\nmysterious and bloody Javanese divinity, leans a kind of hut, rudely\nconstructed of fragments of brick and stone; the door, made of woven\nrushes, is open, and a red light streams from it, which throws its rays\non the tall grass that covers the ground.Three men are assembled in this\nhovel, around a clay-lamp, with a wick of cocoanut fibre steeped in\npalm-oil.The first of these three, about forty years of age, is poorly clad in the\nEuropean fashion; his pale, almost white, complexion, announces that he\nbelongs to the mixed race, being offspring of a white father and Indian\nmother.The second is a robust African <DW64>, with thick lips, vigorous\nshoulders, and lank legs; his woolly hair is beginning to turn gray; he\nis covered with rags, and stands close beside the Indian.The third\npersonage is asleep, and stretched on a mat in the corner of the hovel.These three men are the three Thuggee chiefs, who, obliged to fly from\nthe continent of India, have taken refuge in Java, under the guidance of\nMahal the Smuggler."The Malay does not return," said the half-blood, named Faringhea, the\nmost redoubtable chief of this homicidal sect: "in executing our orders,\nhe has perhaps been killed by Djalma.""The storm of this morning brought every reptile out of the earth," said\nthe <DW64>; "the Malay must have been bitten, and his body ere now a nest\nof serpents.""To serve the good work," proceeded Faringhea, with a gloomy air, "one\nmust know how to brave death.""And to inflict it," added the <DW64>.A stifled cry, followed by some inarticulate words, here drew the\nattention of these two men, who hastily turned their heads in the\ndirection of the sleeper.His\nbeardless face, of a bright copper color, his robe of coarse stuff, his\nturban striped brown and yellow, showed that he belonged to the pure\nHindoo race.His sleep appeared agitated by some painful vision; an\nabundant sweat streamed over his countenance, contracted by terror; he\nspoke in his dream, but his words were brief and broken, and accompanied\nwith convulsive starts.said Faringhea to the <DW64>."Do you not remember, how, five years ago, that savage, Colonel Kennedy,\nbutcher of the Indians, came to the banks of the Ganges, to hunt the\ntiger, with twenty horses, four elephants, and fifty servants?""Yes, yes," said the <DW64>; "and we three, hunters of men, made a better\nday\'s sport than he did.Kennedy, his horses, his elephants, and his\nnumerous servants did not get their tiger--but we got ours," he added,\nwith grim irony."Yes; Kennedy, that tiger with a human face, fell into\nour ambush, and the brothers of the good work offered up their fine prey\nto our goddess Bowanee.""If you remember, it was just at the moment when we gave the last tug to\nthe cord round Kennedy\'s neck, that we perceived on a sudden a traveller\nclose at hand.He had seen us, and it was necessary to make away with\nhim.Now, since that time," added Faringhea, "the remembrance of the\nmurder of that man pursues our brother in his dreams," and he pointed to\nthe sleeping Indian."And even when he is awake," said the <DW64>, looking at Faringhea with a\nsignificant air.said the other, again pointing to the Indian, who, in the\nagitation of his dream, recommenced talking in abrupt sentences; "listen!he is repeating the answers of the traveller, when we told him he must\ndie, or serve with us on Thuggee.His mind is still impressed--deeply\nimpressed--with those words."And, in fact, the Indian repeated aloud in his sleep, a sort of\nmysterious dialogue, of which he himself supplied both questions and\nanswers."\'Traveller,\' said he, in a voice broken by sudden pauses, \'why that\nblack mark on your forehead, stretching from one temple to the other?It\nis a mark of doom and your look is sad as death.Come with us; Kallee will avenge you.--\'Yes, I have\ngreatly suffered.\'--\'Yes, for a very long\ntime.\'--What do you reserve for\nthose who injure you?\'--\'Will you not render blow for\nblow?\'--\'Who are you, then, that render\ngood for evil?\'--\'I am one who loves, and suffers, and forgives.\'"said the <DW64> to Faringhea; "he has not\nforgotten the words of the traveller before his death."Still under the influence of his dream, the Indian continued:\n\n"\'Traveller, we are three; we are brave; we have your life in our\nhands--you have seen us sacrifice to the good work.Be one of us, or\ndie--die--die!Not thus--do not look at me thus!\'"As he\nuttered these last words, the Indian made a sudden movement, as if to\nkeep off some approaching object, and awoke with a start.Then, passing\nhis hand over his moist forehead, he looked round him with a bewildered\neye."For a bold hunter of\nmen, you have a weak head.Luckily, you have a strong heart and arm."The other remained a moment silent, his face buried in his hands; then he\nreplied: "It is long since I last dreamed of that traveller."said Faringhea, shrugging his shoulders."Did you not\nyourself throw the cord around his neck?""Did we not dig his grave by the side of Colonel Kennedy\'s?Did we not\nbury him with the English butcher, under the sand and the rushes?""Yes, we dug his grave," said the Indian, trembling; "and yet, only a\nyear ago, I was seated one evening at the gate of Bombay, waiting for one\nof our brothers--the sun was setting behind the pagoda, to the right of\nthe little hill--the scene is all before me now--I was seated under a\nfigtree--when I heard a slow, firm, even step, and, as I turned round my\nhead--I saw him--coming out of the town.""A vision," said the <DW64>; "always the same vision!""A vision," added Faringhea, "or a vague resemblance.""I knew him by the black mark on his forehead; it was none but he.I\nremained motionless with fear, gazing at him with eyes aghast.He\nstopped, bending upon me his calm, sad look.In spite of myself, I could\nnot help exclaiming: \'It is he!\'--\'Yes,\' he replied, in his gentle voice,\n\'it is I. Since all whom thou killest must needs live again,\' and he\npointed to heaven as he spoke, \'why shouldst thou kill?--Hear me!I have\njust come from Java; I am going to the other end of the world, to a\ncountry of never-melting snow; but, here or there, on plains of fire or\nplains of ice, I shall still be the same.Even so is it with the souls of\nthose who fall beneath thy kalleepra; in this world or up above, in this\ngarb or in another, the soul must still be a soul; thou canst not smite\nit.--and shaking his head sorrowfully, he went on his\nway, walking slowly, with downcast eyes; he ascended the hill of the\npagoda; I watched him as he went, without being able to move: at the\nmoment the sun set, he was standing on the summit of the hill, his tall\nfigure thrown out against the sky--and so he disappeared.added the Indian with a shudder, after a long pause: "it was none but\nhe."In this story the Indian had never varied, though he had often\nentertained his companions with the same mysterious adventure.This\npersistency on his part had the effect of shaking their incredulity, or\nat least of inducing them to seek some natural cause for this apparently\nsuperhuman event."Perhaps," said Faringhea, after a moment\'s reflection, "the knot round\nthe traveller\'s neck got jammed, and some breath was left him, the air\nmay have penetrated the rushes with which we covered his grave, and so\nlife have returned to him.""No, no," said the Indian, shaking his head, "this man is not of our\nrace."said the Indian, in a solemn voice; "the number of victims that\nthe children of Bowanee have sacrificed since the commencement of ages,\nis nothing compared to the immense heap of dead and dying, whom this\nterrible traveller leaves behind him in his murderous march."cried the <DW64> and Faringhea.repeated the Hindoo, with a convinced accent, that made its\nimpression upon his companions."Hear me and tremble!--When I met this\ntraveller at the gates of Bombay, he came from Java, and was going\ntowards the north, he said.The very next day, the town was a prey to the\ncholera, and we learned sometime after, that this plague had first broken\nout here, in Java.""That is true," said the <DW64>."\'I am going towards the\nnorth, to a country of eternal snow,\' said the traveller to me.The\ncholera also went towards the north, passing through Muscat--Ispahan\n--Tauris--Tiflis--till it overwhelmed Siberia.""True," said Faringhea, becoming thoughtful:\n\n"And the cholera," resumed the Indian, "only travelled its five or six\nleagues a day--a man\'s tramp--never appeared in two places at once--but\nswept on slowly, steadily,--even as a man proceeds."At the mention of this strange coincidence, the Hindoo\'s companions\nlooked at each other in amazement.After a silence of some minutes, the\nawe-struck <DW64> said to the last speaker: "So you think that this man--"\n\n"I think that this man, whom we killed, restored to life by some infernal\ndivinity, has been commissioned to bear this terrible scourge over the\nearth, and to scatter round his steps that death, from which he is\nhimself secure.added the Indian, with gloomy enthusiasm,\n"this awful wayfarer passed through Java--the cholera wasted Java.He\npassed through Bombay--the cholera wasted Bombay.He went towards the\nnorth--the cholera wasted the north."So saying, the Indian fell into a profound reverie.The <DW64> and\nFaringhea were seized with gloomy astonishment.The Indian spoke the truth as to the mysterious march (still unexplained)\nof that fearful malady, which has never been known to travel more than\nfive or six leagues a day, or to appear simultaneously in two spots.Nothing can be more curious, than to trace out, on the maps prepared at\nthe period in question, the slow, progressive course of this travelling\npestilence, which offers to the astonished eye all the capricious\nincidents of a tourist\'s journey.Passing this way rather than\nthat--selecting provinces in a country--towns in a province--one quarter\nin a town--one street in a quarter--one house in a street--having its\nplace of residence and repose, and then continuing its slow, mysterious,\nfear inspiring march.The words of the Hindoo, by drawing attention to these dreadful\neccentricities, made a strong impression upon the minds of the <DW64> and\nFaringhea--wild natures, brought by horrible doctrines to the monomania\nof murder.Yes--for this also is an established fact--there have been in India\nmembers of an abominable community, who killed without motive, without\npassion--killed for the sake of killing--for the pleasure of murder--to\nsubstitute death for life--to make of a living man a corpse, as they have\nthemselves declared in one of their examinations.The mind loses itself in the attempt to penetrate the causes of these\nmonstrous phenomena.By what incredible series of events, have men been\ninduced to devote themselves to this priesthood of destruction?Without\ndoubt, such a religion could only flourish in countries given up, like\nIndia, to the most atrocious slavery, and to the most merciless iniquity\nof man to man.Such a creed!--is it not the hate of exasperated humanity, wound up to\nits highest pitch by oppression?--May not this homicidal sect, whose\norigin is lost in the night of ages, have been perpetuated in these\nregions, as the only possible protest of slavery against despotism?May\nnot an inscrutable wisdom have here made Phansegars, even as are made\ntigers and serpents?What is most remarkable in this awful sect, is the mysterious bond,\nwhich, uniting its members amongst themselves, separates them from all\nother men.They have laws and customs of their own, they support and help\neach other, but for them there is neither country nor family; they owe no\nallegiance save to a dark, invisible power, whose decrees they obey with\nblind submission, and in whose name they spread themselves abroad, to\nmake corpses, according to their own savage expression.[6]\n\nFor some moments the three Stranglers had maintained a profound silence.Outside the hut, the moon continued to throw great masses of white\nradiance, and tall bluish shadows, over the imposing fabric of the ruins;\nthe stars sparkled in the heavens; from time to time, a faint breeze\nrustled through the thick and varnished leaves of the bananas and the\npalms.The pedestal of the gigantic statue, which, still entire, stood on the\nleft side of the portico, rested upon large flagstones, half hidden with\nbrambles.Suddenly, one of these stones appeared to fall in; and from the\naperture, which thus formed itself without noise, a man, dressed in\nuniform, half protruded his body, looked carefully around him, and\nlistened.Seeing the rays of the lamp, which lighted the interior of the hovel,\ntremble upon the tall grass, he turned round to make a signal, and soon,\naccompanied by two other soldiers, he ascended, with the greatest silence\nand precaution, the last steps of the subterranean staircase, and went\ngliding amongst the ruins.For a few moments, their moving shadows were\nthrown upon the moonlit ground; then they disappeared behind some\nfragments of broken wall.At the instant when the large stone resumed its place and level, the\nheads of many other soldiers might have been seen lying close in the\nexcavation.The half-caste, the Indian, and the <DW64>, still seated\nthoughtfully in the hut, did not perceive what was passing.[6] The following are some passages from the Count de Warren\'s very\ncurious book, "British India in 1831:" "Besides the robbers, who kill for\nthe sake of the booty they hope to find upon travellers, there is a class\nof assassins, forming an organized society, with chiefs of their own, a\nslang-language, a science, a free-masonry, and even a religion, which has\nits fanaticism and its devotion, its agents, emissaries, allies, its\nmilitant forces, and its passive adherents, who contribute their money to\nthe good work.This is the community of the Thugs or Phansegars\n(deceivers or stranglers, from thugna, to deceive, and phansna, to\nstrangle), a religious and economical society, which speculates with the\nhuman race by exterminating men; its origin is lost in the night of ages."Until 1810 their existence was unknown, not only to the European\nconquerors, but even to the native governments.Between the years 1816\nand 1830, several of their bands were taken in the act, and punished: but\nuntil this last epoch, all the revelations made on the subject by\nofficers of great experience, had appeared too monstrous to obtain the\nattention or belief of the public; they had been rejected and despised as\nthe dreams of a heated imagination.And yet for many years, at the very\nleast for half a century, this social wound had been frightfully on the\nincrease, devouring the population from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin and\nfrom Cutch to Assam."It was in the year 1830 that the revelations of a celebrated chief,\nwhose life was spared on condition of his denouncing his accomplices,\nlaid bare the whole system.The basis of the Thuggee Society is a\nreligious belief--the worship of Bowanee, a gloomy divinity, who is only\npleased with carnage, and detests above all things the human race.Her\nmost agreeable sacrifices are human victims, and the more of these her\ndisciple may have offered up in this world the more he will be\nrecompensed in the next by all the delights of soul and sense, by women\nalways beautiful, and joys eternally renewed.If the assassin meets the\nscaffold in his career, he dies with the enthusiasm of a martyr, because\nhe expects his reward.To obey his divine mistress, he murders, without\nanger and without remorse, the old man, woman and child; whilst, to his\nfellow-religionists, he may be charitable, humane, generous, devoted, and\nmay share all in common with them, because, like himself, they are the\nministers and adopted children of Bowanee.The destruction of his\nfellow-creatures, not belonging to his community--the diminution of the\nhuman race--that is the primary object of his pursuit; it is not as a\nmeans of gain, for though plunder may be a frequent, and doubtless an\nagreeable accessory, it is only secondary in his estimation.Destruction\nis his end, his celestial mission, his calling; it is also a delicious\npassion, the most captivating of all sports--this hunting of men!--\'You\nfind great pleasure,\' said one of those that were condemned, \'in tracking\nthe wild beast to his den, in attacking the boar, the tiger, because\nthere is danger to brave, energy and courage to display.Think how this\nattraction must be redoubled, when the contest is with man, when it is\nman that is to be destroyed.Instead of the single faculty of courage,\nall must be called into action--courage, cunning, foresight, eloquence,\nintrigue.To sport\nwith all the passions, to touch the chords of love and friendship, and so\ndraw the prey into one\'s net--that is a glorious chase--it is a delight,\na rapture, I tell you!\'"Whoever was in India in the years 1831 and 1832, must remember the\nstupor and affright, which the discovery of this vast infernal machine\nspread through all classes of society.A great number of magistrates and\nadministrators of provinces refused to believe in it, and could not be\nbrought to comprehend that such a system had so long preyed on the body\npolitic, under their eyes as it were, silently, and without betraying\nitself."--See "British India in 183," by Count Edward de Warren, 2 vols.THE AMBUSCADE\n\nThe half-blood Faringhea, wishing doubtless to escape from the dark\nthoughts which the words of the Indian on the mysterious course of the\nCholera had raised within him, abruptly changed the subject of\nconversation.His eye shone with lurid fire, and his countenance took an\nexpression of savage enthusiasm, as he cried: "Bowanee will always watch\nover us, intrepid hunters of men!The world\nis large; our prey is everywhere.The English may force us to quit India,\nthree chiefs of the good work--but what matter?We leave there our\nbrethren, secret, numerous, and terrible, as black scorpions, whose\npresence is only known by their mortal sting.said he to the Hindoo, with an\ninspired air.Wherever men are to be found, there must\nbe oppressors and victims--wherever there are victims, there must be\nhearts swollen with hate--it is for us to inflame that hate with all the\nardor of vengeance!It is for us, servants of Bowanee, to draw towards\nus, by seducing wiles, all whose zeal, courage, and audacity may be\nuseful to the cause.Let us rival each other in devotion and sacrifices;\nlet us lend each other strength, help, support!That all who are not with\nus may be our prey, let us stand alone in the midst of all, against all,\nand in spite of all.For us, there must be neither country nor family.Our family is composed of our brethren; our country is the world."This kind of savage eloquence made a deep impression on the <DW64> and the\nIndian, over whom Faringhea generally exercised considerable influence,\nhis intellectual powers being very superior to theirs, though they were\nthemselves two of the most eminent chiefs of this bloody association.cried the Indian, sharing the enthusiasm\nof Faringhea; "the world is ours.Even here, in Java, let us leave some\ntrace of our passage.Before we depart, let us establish the good work in\nthis island; it will increase quickly, for here also is great misery, and\nthe Dutch are rapacious as the English.Brother, I have seen in the\nmarshy rice-fields of this island, always fatal to those who cultivate\nthem, men whom absolute want forced to the deadly task--they were livid\nas corpses--some of them worn out with sickness, fatigue, and hunger,\nfell--never to rise again.Brothers, the good work will prosper in this\ncountry!""The other evening," said the half-caste, "I was on the banks of the\nlake, behind a rock; a young woman came there--a few rags hardly covered\nher lean and sun-scorched body--in her arms she held a little child,\nwhich she pressed weeping to her milkless breast.She kissed it three\ntimes, and said to it: \'You, at least, shall not be so unhappy as your\nfather\'--and she threw it into the lake.It uttered one wail, and\ndisappeared.On this cry, the alligators, hidden amongst the reeds,\nleaped joyfully into the water.There are mothers here who kill their\nchildren out of pity.--Brothers, the good work will prosper in this\ncountry!""This morning," said the <DW64>, "whilst they tore the flesh of one of his\nblack slaves with whips, a withered old merchant of Batavia left his\ncountry-house to come to the town.Lolling in his palanquin, he received,\nwith languid indolence, the sad caresses of two of those girls, whom he\nhad bought, to people his harem, from parents too poor to give them food.The palanquin, which held this little old man, and the girls, was carried\nby twelve young and robust men.There are here, you see, mothers who in\ntheir misery sell their own daughters--slaves that are scourged--men that\ncarry other men, like beasts of burden.--Brothers, the good work will\nprosper in this country!""Yes, in this country--and in every land of oppression, distress,\ncorruption, and slavery.""Could we but induce Djalma to join us, as Mahal the Smuggler advised,"\nsaid the Indian, "our voyage to Java would doubly profit us; for we\nshould then number among our band this brave and enterprising youth, who\nhas so many motives to hate mankind.""He will soon be here; let us envenom his resentments.""Remind him of his father\'s death!""Only let hatred inflame his heart, and he will be ours."The <DW64>, who had remained for some time lost in thought, said suddenly:\n"Brothers, suppose Mahal the Smuggler were to betray us?""He" cried the Hindoo, almost with indignation; "he gave us an asylum on\nboard his bark; he secured our flight from the Continent; he is again to\ntake us with him to Bombay, where we shall find vessels for America,\nEurope, Africa.""What interest would Mahal have to betray us?""Nothing\ncould save him from the vengeance of the sons of Bowanee, and that he\nknows.""Well," said the black, "he promised to get Djalma to come hither this\nevening, and, once amongst us, he must needs be our own.""Was it not the Smuggler who told us to order the Malay to enter the\najoupa of Djalma, to surprise him during his sleep, and, instead of\nkilling him as he might have done, to trace the name of Bowanee upon his\narm?Djalma will thus learn to judge of the resolution, the cunning and\nobedience of our brethren, and he will understand what he has to hope or\nfear from such men.Be it through admiration or through terror, he must\nbecome one of us.""But if he refuses to join us, notwithstanding the reasons he has to hate\nmankind?""Then--Bowanee will decide his fate," said Faringhea, with a gloomy look;\n"I have my plan.""But will the Malay succeed in surprising Djalma during his sleep?""There is none nobler, more agile, more dexterous, than the Malay," said\nFaringhea."He once had the daring to surprise in her den a black\npanther, as she suckled her cub.He killed the dam, and took away the\nyoung one, which he afterwards sold to some European ship\'s captain."exclaimed the Indian, listening to a singular\nkind of hoot, which sounded through the profound silence of the night and\nof the woods."Yes, it is the scream of the vulture seizing its prey," said the <DW64>,\nlistening in his turn; "it is also the signal of our brethren, after they\nhave seized their prey."In a few minutes, the Malay appeared at the door of the hut.He had wound\naround him a broad length of cotton, adorned with bright  stripes."Well," said the <DW64>, anxiously; "have you succeeded?""Djalma must bear all his life the mark of the good work," said the\nMalay, proudly."To reach him, I was forced to offer up to Bowanee a man\nwho crossed my path--I have left his body under the brambles, near the\najoupa.But Djalma is marked with the sign.Mahal the Smuggler was the\nfirst to know it."said the Indian, confounded by the Malay\'s\nadroitness."Had he awoke," replied the other, calmly, "I should have been a dead\nman--as I was charged to spare his life.""Because his life may be more useful to us than his death," said the\nhalf-caste.Then, addressing the Malay, he added: "Brother, in risking\nlife for the good work, you have done to-day what we did yesterday, what\nwe may do again to-morrow.This time, you obey; another you will\ncommand.""We all belong to Bowanee," answered the Malay."What is there yet to\ndo?--I am ready."Whilst he thus spoke, his face was turned towards the\ndoor of the hut; on a sudden, he said in a low voice: "Here is Djalma."He must not see me yet," said Faringhea, retiring to an obscure corner\nof the cabin, and hiding himself under a mat; "try to persuade him.If he\nresists--I have my project."Hardly had Faringhea disappeared, saying these words, when Djalma arrived\nat the door of the hovel.At sight of those three personages with their\nforbidding aspect, Djalma started in surprise.But ignorant that these\nmen belonged to the Phansegars, and knowing that, in a country where\nthere are no inns, travellers often pass the night under a tent, or\nbeneath the shelter of some ruins, he continued to advance towards them.After the first moment, he perceived by the complexion and the dress of\none of these men, that he was an Indian, and he accosted him in the\nHindoo language: "I thought to have found here a European--a Frenchman--"\n\n"The Frenchman is not yet come," replied the Indian; "but he will not be\nlong."Guessing by Djalma\'s question the means which Mahal had employed to draw\nhim into the snare, the Indian hoped to gain time by prolonging his\nerror.asked Djalma of the Phansegar."He appointed us to meet here, as he did you," answered the Indian.inquired Djalma, more and more astonished."General Simon told you to be at this place?""Yes, General Simon," replied the Indian.There was a moment\'s pause, during which Djalma sought in vain to explain\nto himself this mysterious adventure.asked he, with a\nlook of suspicion; for the gloomy silence of the Phansegar\'s two\ncompanions, who stared fixedly at each other, began to give him some\nuneasiness."We are yours, if you will be ours," answered the Indian."I have no need of you--nor you of me."The English killed your father, a king; made you a\ncaptive; proscribed you, you have lost all your possessions."At this cruel reminder, the countenance of Djalma darkened.He started,\nand a bitter smile curled his lip.The Phansegar continued:\n\n"Your father was just and brave--beloved by his subjects--they called him\n\'Father of the Generous,\' and he was well named.Will you leave his death\nunavenged?Will the hate, which gnaws at your heart, be without fruit?""My father died with arms in his hand.I revenged his death on the\nEnglish whom I killed in war.He, who has since been a father to me, and\nwho fought also in the same cause, told me, that it would now be madness\nto attempt to recover my territory from the English.When they gave me my\nliberty, I swore never again to set foot in India--and I keep the oaths I\nmake.""Those who despoiled you, who took you captive, who killed your\nfather--were men.Are there not other men, on whom you can avenge\nyourself!"You, who speak thus of men, are not a man!""I, and those who resemble me, are more than men.We are, to the rest of\nthe human race, what the bold hunter is to the wild beasts, which they\nrun down in the forest.Will you be, like us, more than a man?Will you\nglut surely, largely, safely--the hate which devours your heart, for all\nthe evil done you?""Your words become more and more obscure: I have no hatred in my heart,"\nsaid Djalma."When an enemy is worthy of me, I fight with him; when he is\nunworthy, I despise him.So that I have no hate--either for brave men or\ncowards."cried the <DW64> on a sudden, pointing with rapid gesture to\nthe door, for Djalma and the Indian had now withdrawn a little from it,\nand were standing in one corner of the hovel.At the shout of the <DW64>, Faringhea, who had not been perceived by\nDjalma, threw off abruptly the mat which covered him, drew his crease,\nstarted up like a tiger, and with one bound was out of the cabin.Then,\nseeing a body of soldiers advancing cautiously in a circle, he dealt one\nof them a mortal stroke, threw down two others, and disappeared in the\nmidst of the ruins.All this passed so instantaneously, that, when Djalma\nturned round, to ascertain the cause of the <DW64>\'s cry of alarm,\nFaringhea had already disappeared.The muskets of several soldiers, crowding to the door, were immediately\npointed at Djalma and the three Stranglers, whilst others went in pursuit\nof Faringhea.The <DW64>, the Malay, and the Indian, seeing the\nimpossibility of resistance, exchanged a few rapid words, and offered\ntheir hands to the cords, with which some of the soldiers had provided\nthemselves.The Dutch captain, who commanded the squad, entered the cabin at this\nmoment.said he, pointing out Djalma to the\nsoldiers, who were occupied in binding the three Phansegars.Djalma had remained petrified with surprise, not understanding what was\npassing round him; but, when he saw the sergeant and two soldiers\napproach with ropes to bind him, he repulsed them with violent\nindignation, and rushed towards the door where stood the officer.The\nsoldiers, who had supposed that Djalma would submit to his fate with the\nsame impassibility as his companions, were astounded by this resistance,\nand recoiled some paces, being struck in spite of themselves, with the\nnoble and dignified air of the son of Kadja-sing."Why would you bind me like these men?"cried Djalma, addressing himself\nin Hindostanee to the officer, who understood that language from his long\nservice in the Dutch colonies."Why would we bind you, wretch?--because you form part of this band of\nassassins.added the officer in Dutch, speaking to the soldiers,\n"are you afraid of him?--Tie the cord tight about his wrists; there will\nsoon be another about his neck.""You are mistaken," said Djalma, with a dignity and calmness which\nastonished the officer; "I have hardly been in this place a quarter of an\nhour--I do not know these men."Not a Phansegar like them?--Who will believe the falsehood?"cried Djalma, with so natural a movement and expression of\nhorror, that with a sign the officer stopped the soldiers, who were again\nadvancing to bind the son of Kadja-sing; "these men form part of that\nhorrible band of murderers!and you accuse me of being their\naccomplice!--Oh, in this case, sir!I am perfectly at ease," said the\nyoung man, with a smile of disdain."It will not be sufficient to say that you are tranquil," replied the\nofficer; "thanks to their confessions, we now know by what mysterious\nsigns to recognize the Thugs.""I repeat, sir, that I hold these murderers in the greatest horror, and\nthat I came here--"\n\nThe <DW64>, interrupting Djalma, said to the officer with a ferocious joy:\n"You have hit it; the sons of the good work do know each other by marks\ntattooed on their skin.For us, the hour has come--we give our necks to\nthe cord.Often enough have we twined it round the necks of those who\nserved not with us the good work.Now, look at our arms, and look at the\narms of this youth!"The officer, misinterpreting the words of the <DW64>, said to Djalma: "It\nis quite clear, that if, as this <DW64> tells us, you do not bear on your\narm the mysterious symbol--(we are going to assure ourselves of the\nfact), and if you can explain your presence here in a satisfactory\nmanner, you may be at liberty within two hours.""You do not understand me," said the <DW64> to the officer; "Prince Djalma\nis one of us, for he bears on his left arm the name of Bowanee."he is like us, a son of Kale!""He is like us, a Phansegar," said the Indian.The three men, irritated at the horror which Djalma had manifested on\nlearning that they were Phansegars, took a savage pride in making it\nbelieved that the son of Kadja-sing belonged to their frightful\nassociation.The latter again\ngave a look of disdainful pity, raised with his right hand his long, wide\nleft sleeve, and displayed his naked arm.cried the officer, for on the inner part of the fore\narm, a little below the bend, the name of the Bowanee, in bright red\nHindoo characters, was distinctly visible.The officer ran to the Malay,\nand uncovered his arm; he saw the same word, the same signs.Not yet\nsatisfied, he assured himself that the <DW64> and the Indian were likewise\nso marked.cried he, turning furiously towards Djalma; "you inspire even\nmore horror than your accomplices.Bind him like a cowardly assassin,"\nadded he to the soldiers; "like a cowardly assassin, who lies upon the\nbrink of the grave, for his execution will not be long delayed."Struck with stupor, Djalma, who for some moments had kept his eye riveted\non the fatal mark, was unable to pronounce a word, or make the least\nmovement: his powers of thought seemed to fail him, in presence of this\nincomprehensible fact.said the officer to him, with\nindignation."I cannot deny what I see--what is," said Djalma, quite overcome."It is lucky that you confess at last," replied the officer."Soldiers,\nkeep watch over him and his accomplices--you answer for them."Almost believing himself the sport of some wild dream.Djalma offered no\nresistance, but allowed himself to be bound and removed with mechanical\npassiveness.The officer, with part of his soldiers, hoped still to\ndiscover Faringhea amongst the ruins; but his search was vain, and, after\nspending an hour in fruitless endeavors, he set out for Batavia, where\nthe escort of the prisoners had arrived before him.Some hours after these events, M. Joshua van Dael thus finished his long\ndespatch, addressed to M. Rodin, of Paris:\n\n"Circumstances were such, that I could not act otherwise; and, taking all\ninto consideration, it is a very small evil for a great good.Three\nmurderers are delivered over to justice, and the temporary arrest of\nDjalma will only serve to make his innocence shine forth with redoubled\nluster."Already this morning I went to the governor, to protest in favor of our\nyoung prince.\'As it was through me,\' I said, \'that those three great\ncriminals fell into the hands of the authorities, let them at least show\nme some gratitude, by doing everything to render clear as day the\ninnocence of Prince Djalma, so interesting by reason of his misfortunes\nand noble qualities.Most certainly,\' I added, \'when I came yesterday to\ninform the governor, that the Phansegars would be found assembled in the\nruins of Tchandi, I was far from anticipating that any one would confound\nwith those wretches the adopted son of General Simon, an excellent man,\nwith whom I have had for some time the most honorable relations.We must,\nthen, at any cost, discover the inconceivable mystery that has placed\nDjalma in this dangerous position;\' and, I continued,\'so convinced am I\nof his innocence, that, for his own sake, I would not ask for any favor\non his behalf.He will have sufficient courage and dignity to wait\npatiently in prison for the day of justice.\'In all this, you see, I\nspoke nothing but the truth, and had not to reproach myself with the\nleast deception, for nobody in the world is more convinced than I am of\nDjalma\'s innocence."The governor answered me as I expected, that morally he felt as certain\nas I did of the innocence of the young prince, and would treat him with\nall possible consideration; but that it was necessary for justice to have\nits course, because it would be the only way of demonstrating the\nfalsehood of the accusation, and discovering by what unaccountable\nfatality that mysterious sign was tattooed upon Djalma\'s arm."Mahal the Smuggler, who alone could enlighten justice on this subject,\nwill in another hour have quitted Batavia, to go on board the \'Ruyter,\'\nwhich will take him to Egypt; for he has a note from me to the captain,\nto certify that he is the person for whom I engaged and paid the passage.At the same time, he will be the bearer of this long despatch, for the\n\'Ruyter\' is to sail in an hour, and the last letter-bag for Europe was\nmade up yesterday evening.But I wished to see the governor this morning,\nbefore closing the present."Thus, then, is Prince Djalma enforced detained for a month, and, this\nopportunity of the \'Ruyter\' once lost, it is materially impossible that\nthe young Indian can be in France by the 13th of next February.You see,\ntherefore, that, even as you ordered, so have I acted according to the\nmeans at my disposal--considering only the end which justifies them--for\nyou tell me a great interest of the society is concerned."In your hands, I have been what we all ought to be in the hands of our\nsuperiors--a mere instrument: since, for the greater glory of God, we\nbecome corpses with regard to the will.[7] Men may deny our unity and\npower, and the times appear opposed to us; but circumstances only change;\nwe are ever the same."Obedience and courage, secrecy and patience, craft and audacity, union\nand devotion--these become us, who have the world for our country, our\nbrethren for family, Rome for our Queen!About ten o\'clock in the morning, Mahal the Smuggler set out with this\ndespatch (sealed) in his possession, to board the "Ruyter."An hour\nlater, the dead body of this same Mahal, strangled by Thuggee, lay\nconcealed beneath some reeds on the edge of a desert strand, whither he\nhad gone to take boat to join the vessel.When at a subsequent period, after the departure of the steamship, they\nfound the corpse of the smuggler, M. Joshua sought in vain for the\nvoluminous packet, which he had entrusted to his care.Neither was there\nany trace of the note which Mahal was to have delivered to the captain of\nthe "Ruyter," in order to be received as passenger.Finally, the searches and bushwhacking ordered throughout the country for\nthe purpose of discovering Faringhea, were of no avail.The dangerous\nchief of the Stranglers was never seen again in Java.[7] It is known that the doctrine of passive and absolute obedience, the\nmain-spring of the Society of Jesus, is summed up in those terrible words\nof the dying Loyola: "Every member of the Order shall be, in the hands of\nhis superiors, even as a corpse (Perinde ac Cadaver)."--E.Three months have elapsed since Djalma was thrown into Batavia Prison\naccused of belonging to the murderous gang of Megpunnas.The following\nscene takes place in France, at the commencement of the month of\nFebruary, 1832, in Cardoville Manor House, an old feudal habitation\nstanding upon the tall cliffs of Picardy, not far from Saint Valery, a\ndangerous coast on which almost every year many ships are totally\nwrecked, being driven on shore by the northwesters, which render the\nnavigation of the Channel so perilous.From the interior of the Castle is heard the howling of a violent\ntempest, which has arisen during the night; a frequent formidable noise,\nlike the discharge of artillery, thunders in the distance, and is\nrepeated by the echoes of the shore; it is the sea breaking with fury\nagainst the high rocks which are overlooked by the ancient Manor House.It is about seven o\'clock in the morning.Daylight is not yet visible\nthrough the windows of a large room situated on the ground-floor.In this\napartment, in which a lamp is burning, a woman of about sixty years of\nage, with a simple and honest countenance, dressed as a rich farmer\'s\nwife of Picardy, is already occupied with her needle-work,\nnotwithstanding the early hour.Close by, the husband of this woman,\nabout the same age as herself, is seated at a large table, sorting and\nputting up in bags divers samples of wheat and oats.The face of this\nwhite-haired man is intelligent and open, announcing good sense and\nhonesty, enlivened by a touch of rustic humor; he wears a shooting-jacket\nof green cloth, and long gaiters of tan- leather, which half\nconceal his black velveteen breeches.The terrible storm which rages without renders still more agreeable the\npicture of this peaceful interior.A rousing fire burns in a broad\nchimney-place faced with white marble, and throws its joyous light on the\ncarefully polished floor; nothing can be more cheerful than the old\nfashioned chintz hangings and curtains with red Chinese figures upon a\nwhite ground, and the panels over the door painted with pastoral scenes\nin the style of Watteau.A clock of Sevres china, and rosewood furniture\ninlaid with green--quaint and portly furniture, twisted into all sorts of\ngrotesque shapes--complete the decorations of this apartment.Out-doors, the gale continued to howl furiously, and sometimes a gust of\nwind would rush down the chimney, or shake the fastenings of the windows.The man who was occupied in sorting the samples of grain was M. Dupont,\nbailiff of Cardoville manor.said his wife; "what dreadful weather, my dear!This M.\nRodin, who is to come here this morning, as the Princess de Saint\nDizier\'s steward announced to us, picked out a very bad day for it.""Why, in truth, I have rarely heard such a hurricane.If M. Rodin has\nnever seen the sea in its fury, he may feast his eyes to-day with the\nsight.""What can it be that brings this M. Rodin, my dear?"The steward tells me in his letter to\nshow M. Rodin the greatest attention, and to obey him as if he were my\nmaster.It will be for him to explain himself, and for me to execute his\norders, since he comes on the part of the princess.""By rights he should come from Mademoiselle Adrienne, as the land belongs\nto her since the death of the duke her father.""Yes; but the princess being aunt to the young lady, her steward manages\nMademoiselle Adrienne\'s affairs--so whether one or the other, it amounts\nto the same thing.""May be M. Rodin means to buy the estate.Though, to be sure, that stout\nlady who came from Paris last week on purpose to see the chateau appeared\nto have a great wish for it."At these words the bailiff began to laugh with a sly look."What is there to laugh at, Dupont?"asked his wife, a very good\ncreature, but not famous for intelligence or penetration."I laugh," answered Dupont, "to think of the face and figure of that\nenormous woman: with such a look, who the devil would call themselves\nMadame de la Sainte-Colombe--Mrs.A pretty saint, and a pretty\ndove, truly!She is round as a hogshead, with the voice of a town-crier;\nhas gray moustachios like an old grenadier, and without her knowing it, I\nheard her say to her servant: \'Stir your stumps, my hearty!\'--and yet she\ncalls herself Sainte-Colombe!""How hard on her you are, Dupont; a body don\'t choose one\'s name.And, if\nshe has a beard, it is not the lady\'s fault.""No--but it is her fault to call herself Sainte-Colombe.Ah, my poor Catherine, you are yet very green in some\nthings.""While you, my poor Dupont, are well read in slander!The first thing she asked for on arriving was the\nchapel of the Castle, of which she had heard speak.She even said that\nshe would make some embellishments in it; and, when I told her we had no\nchurch in this little place, she appeared quite vexed not to have a\ncurate in the village."that\'s the first thought of your upstarts--to play the\ngreat lady of the parish, like your titled people.""Madame de la Sainte-Colombe need not play the great lady, because she is\none.""Yes--only see how she was dressed, in scarlet gown, and violet gloves\nlike a bishop\'s; and, when she took off her bonnet, she had a diamond\nband round her head-dress of false, light hair, and diamond ear-drops as\nlarge as my thumb, and diamond rings on every finger!None of your\ntuppenny beauties would wear so many diamonds in the middle of the day.""Do you mean to say there\'s more?""She talked of nothing but dukes, and marquises, and counts, and very\nrich gentlemen, who visit at her house, and are her most intimate\nfriends; and then, when she saw the summer house in the park, half-burnt\nby the Prussians, which our late master never rebuilt, she asked, \'What\nare those ruins there?\'and I answered: \'Madame, it was in the time of\nthe Allies that the pavilion was burnt.\'--\'Oh, my clear,\' cried she; \'our\nallies, good, dear allies!So\nyou see, Dupont, I said to myself directly: \'She was no doubt one of the\nnoble women who fled abroad--\'"\n\n"Madame de la Sainte-Colombe!"cried the bailiff, laughing heartily."Oh,\nmy poor, poor wife!""Oh, it is all very well; but because you have been three years at Paris,\ndon\'t think yourself a conjurer!""Catherine, let\'s drop it: you will make me say some folly, and there are\ncertain things which dear, good creatures like you need never know.""I cannot tell what you are driving at, only try to be less\nslanderous--for, after all, should Madame de la Sainte-Colombe buy the\nestate, will you be sorry to remain as her bailiff, eh?""Not I--for we are getting old, my good Catherine; we have lived here\ntwenty years, and we have been too honest to provide for our old days by\npilfering--and truly, at our age, it would be hard to seek another place,\nwhich perhaps we should not find.What I regret is, that Mademoiselle\nAdrienne should not keep the land; it seems that she wished to sell it,\nagainst the will of the princess."is it not very extraordinary that Mademoiselle\nAdrienne should have the disposal of her large fortune so early in life?"Our young lady, having no father or mother, is\nmistress of her property, besides having a famous little will of her own.Dost remember, ten years ago, when the count brought her down here one\nsummer?--what an imp of mischief!eh?--how they\nsparkled, even then!""It is true that Mademoiselle Adrienne had in her look--an expression--a\nvery uncommon expression for her age.""If she has kept what her witching, luring face promised, she must be\nvery pretty by this time, notwithstanding the peculiar color of her\nhair--for, between ourselves, if she had been a tradesman\'s daughter,\ninstead of a young lady of high birth, they would have called it red."Heaven forbid--I always thought\nthat she would be as good as pretty, and it is not speaking ill of her to\nsay she has red hair.On the contrary, it always appears to me so fine,\nso bright, so sunny, and to suit so well her snowy complexion and black\neyes, that in truth I would not have had it other than it was; and I am\nsure, that now this very color of her hair, which would be a blemish in\nany one else, must only add to the charm of Mademoiselle Adrienne\'s face.She must have such a sweet vixen look!"to be candid, she really was a vixen--always running about the park,\naggravating her governess, climbing the trees--in fact, playing all\nmanner of naughty tricks.""I grant you, Mademoiselle Adrienne was a chip of the old block; but then\nwhat wit, what engaging ways, and above all, what a good heart!"Once I remember she gave her shawl and her\nnew merino frock to a poor little beggar girl, and came back to the house\nin her petticoat, and bare arms.""Oh, an excellent heart--but headstrong--terribly headstrong!""Yes--that she was; and \'tis likely to finish badly, for it seems that\nshe does things at Paris--oh!such things--"\n\n"What things?""Oh, my dear; I can hardly venture--"\n\n"Fell, but what are they?""Why," said the worthy dame, with a sort of embarrassment and confusion,\nwhich showed how much she was shocked by such enormities, "they say, that\nMademoiselle Adrienne never sets foot in a church, but lives in a kind of\nheathen temple in her aunt\'s garden, where she has masked women to dress\nher up like a goddess, and scratches them very often, because she gets\ntipsy--without mentioning, that every night she plays on a hunting horn\nof massive gold--all which causes the utmost grief and despair to her\npoor aunt the princess."Here the bailiff burst into a fit of laughter, which interrupted his\nwife."Now tell me," said he, when this first access of hilarity was over,\n"where did you get these fine stories about Mademoiselle Adrienne?""From Rene\'s wife, who went to Paris to look for a child to nurse; she\ncalled at Saint-Dizier House, to see Madame Grivois, her godmother.--Now\nMadame Grivois is first bedchamber woman to the princess--and she it was\nwho told her all this--and surely she ought to know, being in the house.""Yes, a fine piece of goods that Grivois!once she was a regular bad \'un,\nbut now she professes to be as over-nice as her mistress; like master\nlike man, they say.The princess herself, who is now so stiff and\nstarched, knew how to carry on a lively game in her time.Fifteen years\nago, she was no such prude: do you remember that handsome colonel of\nhussars, who was in garrison at Abbeville?an exiled noble who had served\nin Russia, whom the Bourbons gave a regiment on the Restoration?""Yes, yes--I remember him; but you are really too backbiting.""Not a bit--I only speak the truth.The colonel spent his whole time\nhere, and every one said he was very warm with this same princess, who is\nnow such a saint.Every evening, some new\nentertainment at the chateau.What a fellow that colonel was, to set\nthings going; how well he could act a play!--I remember--"\n\nThe bailiff was unable to proceed.A stout maid-servant, wearing the\ncostume and cap of Picardy, entered in haste, and thus addressed her\nmistress: "Madame, there is a person here that wants to speak to master;\nhe has come in the postmaster\'s calash from Saint-Valery, and he says\nthat he is M.A moment after, M. Rodin made his appearance.According to his custom, he\nwas dressed even more than plainly.With an air of great humility, he\nsaluted the bailiff and his wife, and at a sign from her husband, the\nlatter withdrew.The cadaverous countenance of M. Rodin, his almost\ninvisible lips, his little reptile eyes, half concealed by their flabby\nlids, and the sordid style of his dress, rendered his general aspect far\nfrom prepossessing; yet this man knew how, when it was necessary, to\naffect, with diabolical art, so much sincerity and good-nature--his words\nwere so affectionate and subtly penetrating--that the disagreeable\nfeeling of repugnance, which the first sight of him generally inspired,\nwore off little by little, and he almost always finished by involving his\ndupe or victim in the tortuous windings of an eloquence as pliant as it\nwas honeyed and perfidious; for ugliness and evil have their fascination,\nas well as what is good and fair.The honest bailiff looked at this man with surprise, when he thought of\nthe pressing recommendation of the steward of the Princess de Saint\nDizier; he had expected to see quite another sort of personage, and,\nhardly able to dissemble his astonishment, he said to him: "Is it to M.\nRodin that I have the honor to speak?""Yes, sir; and here is another letter from the steward of the Princess de\nSaint-Dizier.""Pray, sir, draw near the fire, whilst I just see what is in this letter.The weather is so bad," continued the bailiff, obligingly, "may I not\noffer you some refreshment?""A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour."Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the\nchamber; like a man of skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just\nand useful inductions from those little appearances, which, revealing a\ntaste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character; on this\noccasion, however, his curiosity was at fault."Very good, sir," said the bailiff, when he had finished reading; "the\nsteward renews his recommendation, and tells me to attend implicitly to\nyour commands.""Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble you\nlong.""It will be no trouble, but an honor.""Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as one\nenters this chateau, one is struck with the good order and perfect\nkeeping of everything in it--which proves, my dear sir, what excellent\ncare you take of it.""Oh, sir, you flatter me.""Flatter you?--a poor old man like myself has something else to think of.But to come to business: there is a room here which is called the Green\nChamber?""Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for a\nstudy.""You will have the goodness to take me there.""Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so.After the death of the\nCount-Duke, and when the seals were removed, a number of papers were shut\nup in a cabinet in that room, and the lawyers took the keys with them to\nParis.""Here are those keys," said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a large and\na small key tied together."Yes--for certain papers--and also far a small mahogany casket, with\nsilver clasps--do you happen to know it?""Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count\'s writing-table.It must be\nin the large, lacquered cabinet, of which you have the key.""You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess de\nSaint-Dizier?""Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?""And Mademoiselle Adrienne?"said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep contrition and\ngrief.has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne?""No, no--she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful."for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil\nspirit of revolt and perversity--to a character which certainly has not\nits equal upon earth--it would be far better to be deprived of those\ndangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition.But\nI conjure you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this subject\nis too painful," said M. Rodin, with a voice of deep emotion, lifting the\ntip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as if to stop a\nrising tear.The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was\nstruck with the change in M. Rodin\'s voice.He answered him, therefore,\nwith much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I really did not\nknow--"\n\n"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of\nfeeling--tears are so rare with old men--but if you had seen, as I have,\nthe despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been too\nmuch kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she\nhas encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my\ndear sir!"After a moment\'s pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his\nemotion, he said to Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that\nwhich relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet\nanother.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a\ncircumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or\nsixteen years ago, the Marquis d\'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in\ngarrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house."It was only just now, that I\nwas talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well\nhe could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In\nthe Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in\nthat part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he\nsang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You\ndoubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious\nBonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d\'Aigrigny (whose private\nsecretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.""That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and\nflattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,\nnotwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a\ngreat preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain\nabbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are\narchbishops and cardinals."M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of\nconviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that\nM. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well, sir, that is splendid\nconduct!"said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of\nsimplicity; "it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like M.\nd\'Aigrigny\'s.But amongst all his good qualities, he has particularly\nthat of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor,\nconscience--and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you.""What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"\n\n"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your\nname.""He will be there soon, if not there now.He went to Italy about three\nmonths ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of\nnews--the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of the\nestates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.""Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to\nthe will of Providence!""And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to\nmention my name?"First of all, you must know that this house is\nsold.The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from\nParis.""I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their\nbailiff."It is just on that subject that I am going\nto speak to you."Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I am\nparticularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do all\nin my power to serve you, if--"\n\n"Ah, sir!"cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; "what gratitude do I not owe\nyou!"Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell you,\nthat I\'m obliged to annex a small condition to my support.""The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in every\nway worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of this\nrespectable--"\n\n"What, sir?"said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; "Madame de la Sainte\nColombe the lady who has bought us out?""Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate.My wife persists that\nshe is a great lady; but--between ourselves--judging by certain words\nthat I heard her speak--"\n\n"You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont.Madame de la Sainte\nColombe is far from being a great lady.I believe she was neither more\nnor less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais\nRoyal.You see, that I deal openly with you.""And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used to\nvisit her!""No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives!However, the fact\nis, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and\nmiddle age--indifferent--alas!more than indifferent to the salvation of\nher soul--Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely way to\nexperience grace--which renders her, as I told you, worthy of veneration,\nbecause nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance--always\nproviding it to be lasting.Now to make the good work sure and effectual,\nwe shall need your assistance, my dear M."A great deal; and I will explain to you how.There is no church in this\nvillage, which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes.Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of the two\nclergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have long\nlived in these parts, for information respecting them."in that case the choice will soon be made.The incumbent of\nDanicourt is one of the best of men.""Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte\nColombe.""You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of\nRoiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust\nherself to his care.""And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?""Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de\nla Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep\nyour place as bailiff.I give you my word of it, and what I promise I\nperform.""I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced\nby Rodin\'s manner, and the authority of his words; "but I should like to\nknow--"\n\n"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with\nyou, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to\nsupport.I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an\nintrigue.It is only for the purpose of doing a good action.The curate\nof Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M.\nd\'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.Though very poor, he has to support an\naged mother.Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte\nColombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of\nzeal and patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little\nadvantages, by which his old mother might profit--there you see is the\nsecret of this mighty scheme.When I knew that this lady was disposed to\nbuy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend\'s parish, I wrote about\nit to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to\nrender him this small service, which, as you see, will not remain without\na recompense.For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have\nthe power to keep you in your place as bailiff.""Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment\'s reflection, "you are so\nfrank and obliging, that I will imitate your sincerity.In the same\ndegree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this\ncountry, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is\ndreaded for his intolerance--and, moreover--"\n\n"Well, and what more?""Why, then, they say--"\n\n"Come, what do they say?"Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff\nwas quite struck dumb with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin\ntook a singular expression when he laughed.he repeated, with\nredoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont, for a man\nof sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle\nstories?--A Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above\nall, can you believe such romance of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old\nfreedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read about them in the\nConstitutionnel!""And yet, sir, they say--"\n\n"Good heavens!what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like\nyou, do not meddle with what is said--they manage their own little\nmatters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice, for\nthe sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable\nprovision for the rest of their days.I tell you frankly, however much I\nmay regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for\nmy man, you will not remain bailiff here."But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady,\nhearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to\nyour friend."but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the\nneighborhood--persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every\nday--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my friend,\nand a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,\nand you will continue bailiff.""But, sir--that would be calumny!"said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and\naffectionate reproach, "how can you think me capable of giving you evil\ncounsel?--I was only making a supposition.You wish to remain bailiff on\nthis estate.I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for you to\nconsider and decide.""But, sir--"\n\n"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other.Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and\nweakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves or\nothers: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but, in\norder to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have\ncontributed to his appointment--I must request that you will write to me\ntwice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked\nin the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de la Sainte\nColombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the\nwhole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the\nproceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it--or, if anything\nblameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed of it by\nthis weekly correspondence.""But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?""Now, my dear M. Dupont!how can you thus brand the sweetest, most\nwholesome of human desires--mutual confidence?--I ask of you nothing\nelse--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that\ngoes on here.On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other,\nyou remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret,\nto recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.""I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any\nconditions!--I and my wife have only this place to give us bread, and we\nare too old to find another.Do not expose our probity of forty years\'\nstanding to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a\ncounsellor!""My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon\nthis, and give me your answer in the course of a week."I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a\nloud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of\nthe cliffs.Hardly had he spoken, when the\nsame noise was again heard more distinctly than before."It is the sound of cannon," cried Dupont, rising; "no doubt a ship in\ndistress, or signaling for a pilot.""My dear," said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, "from the terrace,\nwe can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted--they are drifting\nright upon the shore--the ship is firing minute gulls--it will be lost."cried the bailiff, taking his hat and preparing to\ngo out, "to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do nothing!""Can no help be given to these vessels?""If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them; since\nthe last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.""Lost with all on board?--Oh, very frightful," said M. Rodin."In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no matter,"\nsaid the bailiff, addressing his wife, "I will run down to the rocks with\nthe people of the farm, and try to save some of them, poor\ncreatures!--Light large fires in several rooms--get ready linen, clothes,\ncordials--I scarcely dare hope to save any, but we must do our best."I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too old\nand feeble to be of any service," said M. Rodin, who was by no means\nanxious to encounter the storm."Your good lady will be kind enough to\nshow me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I require,\nI will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste."Ring the big bell," said the\nbailiff to his servant; "let all the people of the farm meet me at the\nfoot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.""Yes, my dear," replied Catherine; "but do not expose yourself.""Kiss me--it will bring me luck," said the bailiff; and he started at a\nfull run, crying: "Quick!quick; by this time not a plank may remain of\nthe vessels.""My dear madam," said Rodin, always impassible, "will you be obliging\nenough to show me the Green Chamber?""Please to follow me, sir," answered Catherine, drying her tears--for she\ntrembled on account of her husband, whose courage she well knew.THE TEMPEST\n\nThe sea is raging.Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white\nfoam, stand out, in high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red\nlight, which extends along the horizon.Above are piled heavy masses of\nblack and sulphurous vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish\ngray, driven by the violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,\nbehind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique\nrays upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of\nthe tallest waves.A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as\nthe eye can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this\ndangerous coast.Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea,\nrises Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its\nbrick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this\nsky loaded with vapors.A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from\nthe stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast.Now she rolls her\nmonstrous hull upon the waves--now plunges into their trough.A flash is\nseen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of the\nroar of the tempest.That gun is the last signal of distress from this\nlost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is\nworking her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a\ndistance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left.The dismasted\nship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must\nsome time pass right ahead of the steamer.Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the\nenormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was\ncarried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered\nuseless.A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel\namidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the\nhelm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the\nship.But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a\ngreater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in\nswiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent--a new\nclanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.The ship was an English vessel, the "Black Eagle," homeward bound from\nAlexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java, via the\nRed Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the\nsteamship "Ruyter."The "Black Eagle," quitting the Straits of Gibraltar,\nhad gone to touch at the Azores.She headed thence for Portsmouth, when\nshe was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester.The steamer was the\n"William Tell," coming from Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in\nthe last place, for Hamburg to Havre.These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide\nand tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed.The\ndeck of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and\npassengers appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea\nbroke on jagged rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.The captain of the "Black Eagle," standing on the poop, holding by the\nremnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful extremity with\ncourageous coolness.The smaller boats had been carried away by the\nwaves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the only\nchance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to\npieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the\nland by means of a life-line--almost the last resort for passing between\nthe shore and a stranded vessel.The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented\nthe general confusion.Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging\nconvulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid\ninsensibility.Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the\ndeck uttering horrible imprecations.Here, women knelt down to pray;\nthere, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the\nawful approach of death.A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her\nchild clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to\nsailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that\nwould take charge of her son.These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent\nresignation of the sailors.Knowing the imminence of the inevitable\ndanger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes,\nwaiting for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with\nthe fury of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death\nwith stoical indifference.Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so\nexpress it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper\n<DW52> complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,\ncontemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness\npeculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,\nhe leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against\none of the bulkheads.Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child\nin her arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to\nseveral of the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the\nyoung man with the copper-<DW52> complexion, threw herself on her knees\nbefore him, and lifted her child towards him with a burst of\ninexpressible agony.The young man took it, mournfully shook his head,\nand pointed to the furious waves--but, with a meaning gesture, he\nappeared to promise that he would at least try to save it.Then the young\nmother, in a mad transport of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and\nbathed it with her tears.Further on, another passenger of the "Black Eagle," seemed animated by\nsentiments of the most active pity.One would hardly have given him\nfive-and-twenty years of age.His long, fair locks fell in curls on\neither side of his angelic countenance.He wore a black cassock and white\nneck-band.Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went from\none to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and resignation;\nto hear him console some, and encourage others, in language full of\nunction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have supposed him\nunaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity,\na religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to\ntime, he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude,\nlove, and serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of\nthose formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may\ndevote himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all,\nat least die with them, pointing to the sky.One might almost have taken\nhim for an angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of\ninexorable fate.not far from this young man\'s angelic beauty, there was\nanother being, who resembled an evil spirit!Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by\nmeans of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible\nscene that was passing on the deck.A grim, wild joy lighted up his\ncountenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from\nthe union of the white race with the East.He wore only a shirt and linen\ndrawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,\nsimilar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,\nor to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly\napproaching--a terrible collision, which would probably cause the two\nvessels to founder before even they touched the rocks--the more did the\ninfernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports.He\nseemed to long, with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work\nof destruction should be accomplished.To see him thus feasting with\navidity on all the agony, the terror, and the despair of those around\nhim, one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary\ndeities, who, in barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.By this time the "Black Eagle," driven by the wind and waves, came so\nnear the "William Tell" that the passengers on the deck of the nearly\ndismantled steamer were visible from the first-named vessel.The heavy sea, which stove in\nthe paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly\nthe whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant\nby this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and\nevery time bore away with them some fresh victims.Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be\nhurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,\none group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray\nmoustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope\nround his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his\nbreast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of\nreindeer-skin.A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and\nbarking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to\neach other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to\nheaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to\nbe saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of\nboth vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest.At the\nmoment when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the\nsteamer was turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a\nprodigious height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended\nover the "William Tell," during the second which preceded the shock of\nthe two vessels.There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to\ndescribe them.Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought,\none catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and\nfleeting, as if illumined by a flash of lightning.Thus, when the "Black Eagle," poised aloft by the flood, was about to\ncrash down upon the "William Tell," the young man with the angelic\ncountenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of the ship, ready\nto cast himself into the sea to save some victim.Suddenly, he perceived\non board the steamer, on which he looked down from the summit of the\nimmense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards him in\nsupplication.They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with a\nsort of ecstacy and religious homage!For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the\napproaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met.The features\nof the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the\nmaidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their\nexpected Saviour.The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay\nhelpless on the deck.A fearful mass of water dashed the "Black Eagle" down upon the "William\nTell," in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam.To the dreadful crash of\nthe two great bodies of wood and iron, which splintering against one\nanother, instantly foundered, one loud cry was added--a cry of agony and\ndeath--the cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the\nwaves!A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the\ntrough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves--with here and there the\ncontracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy wretches,\nstriving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the risk of\nbeing crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.While the bailiff was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of\nthe passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin,\nconducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles\nthat he was to take with him to Paris.After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate\nof the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the\ninhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly\noccupied by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery.When he\nentered it he found nobody there.Under his arm he held a casket, with\nsilver fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red\nmorocco portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned\ngreat coat.Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d\'Aigrigny\'s secretary\nbeen able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile, his\nfeatures would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was\nunder the influence of the most agreeable thoughts.Having placed the\ncasket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus\ncommuned with himself:\n\n"All goes well.It was prudent to keep these papers here till this\nmoment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of\nthat Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it\nis impossible she should know.Fortunately, the time approaches when we\nshall have no more need to fear her.Her fate will be a cruel one; it\nmust be so.Those proud, independent characters are at all times our\nnatural enemies--they are so by their very essence--how much more when\nthey show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous!As for La Sainte\nColombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool calls\nhis conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a\nlivelihood, he will not hesitate.I wish to have him because he will\nserve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will\nprevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand: in\ntheir youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others serve\nhim; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this fear\nmust continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville, which, from\nits isolated position, will make us an excellent college.As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of February approaches,\nwithout news from Joshua--evidently, Prince Djalma is still kept prisoner\nby the English in the heart of India, or I must have received letters\nfrom Batavia.The daughters of General Simon will be detained at Leipsic\nfor at least a month longer.All our foreign relations are in the best\ncondition.As for our internal affairs--"\n\n Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the\nentrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to\ngive assistance in case of need."Now," said she to the servant, "light a fire in the next room; put this\nwarm wine there; your master may be in every minute.""Well, my dear madam," said Rodin to her, "do they hope to save any of\nthese poor creatures?"He is so courageous, so imprudent, if\nonce he thinks he can be of any service.""Courageous even to imprudence," said Rodin to himself, impatiently; "I\ndo not like that.""Well," resumed Catherine, "I have here at hand my hot linen, my\ncordials--heaven grant it may all be of use!""We may at least hope so, my dear madam.I very much regretted that my\nage and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband.I\nalso regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to\nwish him joy if successful--for I am unfortunately compelled to depart,\nmy moments are precious.I shall be much obliged if you will have the\ncarriage got ready.""Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.""One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont.You are a woman of sense, and\nexcellent judgment.Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if he\nwill, his situation as bailiff of the estate--"\n\n"Is it possible?Without this place\nwhat would become of us at our time of life?""I have only saddled my promise with two conditions--mere trifles--he\nwill explain all that to you."we shall regard you as our deliverer."Only, on two little conditions--"\n\n"If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them.Think what we\nshould be without this place--penniless--absolutely penniless!""I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will try\nto persuade him."here\'s master come back," cried a servant,\nrushing into the chamber."No, missus; he is alone."A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were\nstreaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he\nhad tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted\nunder his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains."There I have thee, my dear love!"cried his wife, tenderly embracing\nhim."Up to the present moment--THREE SAVED."said Rodin; "at least your efforts\nwill not have been all in vain.""I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of Goelands.Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.""Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.""And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?"asked Rodin,\nwho could not avoid remaining a few instants longer."They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people.As they cannot\nwalk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the\nnecessary measures for their reception.First of all, my dear, you must\nget ready some women\'s clothes.""There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?""There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere\nchildren--and so pretty!"said Rodin, with an affectation of interest."The person to whom they owe their lives is with them."Yes; only fancy--"\n\n"You can tell me all this by and by.Just slip on this dry warm\ndressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine."I\'ll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death.I was telling you that\nthe person who saved these young girls was a hero; and certainly his\ncourage was beyond anything one could have imagined.When I left here\nwith the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and\narrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,\nfortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous\nmasses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet\nstill in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though\nthey had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the\nsea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,\nthe tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to\ndry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the\nbailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the\ndifference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her\nclasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by\na chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last\nwords of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color\nspread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms\nwould have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for\nlong years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no\nordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a\nslightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was\ndoubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are\norphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where\nthe sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of\na man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,\nclinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of\ntime, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our\nmen.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with\nhaving saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had\nattempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst\nthe rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid\nof our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to\nwhich he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to\nthis conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,\nonly increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,\nwere fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that\none might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain\nwith a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters\nof General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of\nshipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at\nLeipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could\nthey have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that\nhe should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,\nwhich offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were\nswallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are\nhere!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the\nbailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin\'s absence of\nmind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is\naltogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet\nface, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he\nhad nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black\nworsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor\'s dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,\nfor he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my\neyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon\nas they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up\nto him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around\nthem, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few\nwords, they fell sobbing into each other\'s arms."How many poor creatures must have\nperished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead\nbodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of\nthe coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as\nI hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked\nguests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which\nopened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat\nnails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A\ntouching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by\nseveral windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to\nwhom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their\ndeliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly\non their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of\nthis man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the\nforehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,\nwith which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the\nadorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the\nmost ideal creations of Raphael\'s pencil--for that divine artist alone\ncould have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the\nserenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an\narchangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous\nhead.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered\nstill more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a\nwound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair\nforehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been\ncruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same\ninjury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his\nwounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,\nthe adopted son of Dagobert\'s wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in\nour days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung\nthe early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always\namongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be\nfound--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,\nbecause it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to\ntry and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the\nmost unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure\nand unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for\nthese humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and\ntheir intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they\nseldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never\ndoes the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated\nlimbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]\n\nIn their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as\nthey recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able\nto ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of\nsustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain\ndeath.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces\nwere deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears\nwere on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both\nfrom agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that\nthey should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was\nto him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to\nclimb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the\nsoldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on\none side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a\nnature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after\nsuch imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of\nGeneral Simon\'s daughters, was a little softened.It must not be\nforgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of\nFebruary, was essential to the success of Rodin\'s projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,\napproached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,\ncrying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the\nother was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a\nlitter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as\nhe went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly\nalong the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in\nthe chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such\ngreat strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,\nspringing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at\nthe same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the\nthreshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while\nSpoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the\norphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down\naltogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the\nobservations of the bailiff\'s wife, on their state of weakness and\nagitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was\ncarried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin\'s face was again violently contracted, for\nhe had till then believed that the guide of General Simon\'s daughters was\ndead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,\nand had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the\nroom, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,\napproached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign\naccent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was\nto ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the\nname of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel\'s side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he\nkept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of\ndeference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did\nhe not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English\nship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that\nbrought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and\nbeing likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I\nembarked on board the \'Black Eagle,\' where I met Prince Djalma.We were\nbound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to\nFrance."This new shock had completely\nparalyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,\nwhich he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell\nme who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,\ndispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to\nhim with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the\nother.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you\nsee, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to\ngive me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,\nnotwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,\nwhile the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow\ncomplexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the\nStranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of\nTchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the\ndespatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter\nby which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the\n"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not\nbeen seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after\nhis escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he\nbelonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a\nfellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,\nbiting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half\ncaste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his\nshoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had\npassed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed\nbefore the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or\nthree years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son\nof poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of\nJapan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say\nthere is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all\nour good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,\naddressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,\nare only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest\nhas lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse\nmurmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable\napartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt\nto be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of\nthe shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had\nfailed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain\ndeath, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when\nthrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has\nbeen able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the\nchamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be\nready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried\nhis clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,\nplaced in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near\nthose occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has\nquitted the door of Rose and Blanche\'s chamber, to lie down and warm\nhimself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a\nfeeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and\nsea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old\nJovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his\nirresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,\never since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was\nthe most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters\nentered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed\nthemselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;\nthough the bailiff\'s wife, after showing them to their room, had returned\nagain to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the\nhurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to\nthe chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was\nsleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing\ntheir canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert\nreposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great\nastonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,\nnot daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled\nnaturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion\nwas the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of\nthe damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed\na profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful\ndream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some\nsad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was\nsleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features\npreserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with\nan inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering\ngoodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed\nsimultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each\nother the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign\nof caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance\nshone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in\nhelping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it\nwould be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a\nbright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently\nbeneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that\nRose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as\nif some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with\nclasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young\npriest.Turning their lovely faces towards\nhim, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to\ntheir youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,\nand, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,\nbeheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle\nvoices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel\'s turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he\nhad saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only\nunto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the\nhand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of\nthe orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who\nexpected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more\nperplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we\nremembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that\ndark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our\nold friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he\nwould not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your\nassistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"\nadded he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother\nfrom heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no\ndoubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your\ndreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are\nnot visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each\nother."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by\nthe hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the\nremembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice\nblessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to\nthis time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an\narchangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert\'s wife had\nadopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a\npriest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a\nblank wound (to use a term of General Simon\'s), had allowed it to be\ncarefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black\nbandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the\nnatural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a\nlittle surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche\nfamiliarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not\nknow that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had\nattempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving\nto cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very\nimperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain\ndeath, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety\nbeneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,\ninto a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his\nwound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of\nthe missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray\nbrows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the\nsisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with\nfilial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of\naffection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious\nglance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose\ncountenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not\ndangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this\nmanner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more\nwrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank\nwound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one\nof his hands to the bandage."How can you be\nso unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,\ndrawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low\nvoice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:\n"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has\nvery much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your\nguard; because--"\n\n"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,\nwe should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,\nand gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the\nshipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,\nand tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his\nhands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,\nI owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that\nservice lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes\neverything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I\nwas trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,\nwas it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that\nyouthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you\nfall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already\nsaid," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these\nchildren you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so\nyoung, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to\nthe priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing\nastonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:\nfor she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her\nson.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even\nnow passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my\ndear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"\n\n"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until\nnow," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the\ngratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are\nthey?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was\nunable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back\nexhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father\'s\nletter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of\nDagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent\njoy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with\naffectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that\'s it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to\nescape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;\nthere was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still\nlive in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her\nfrom the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should\nbe still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a\nhand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little\nladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended\nto know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: \'It was\nthe angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told\nthee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend\nus--\'"\n\n"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the\nmissionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered\na deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His\nfeatures were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance\nat the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of\nRodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the\nmischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful\nconstraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant\nwe have just met?I have too much to\ntell you, and to ask in return.It\nwill be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he\'s in citizen\'s dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in\nyour troop, send him to the--"\n\n"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to\nremain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between\nhis teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall\nI tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my\nduty, and have no will but my superior\'s.As soon as you arrive in Paris,\nI will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,\nAgricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination\nis," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad\nfortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for\nthey tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out\nalmost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with\nyou fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a\nstifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let\'s say farewell for the present.After all,\ntwenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned\nthe friendly pressure of the veteran\'s hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in\ntheir eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who\nhad not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for\nParis, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too\nmuch injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,\nremained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow\ncountryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of\nDagobert\'s wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the\nshipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one\nend of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the\nlittle square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,\nor rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in\nbetween immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of\nwhich excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the\nyear, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,\nduring the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate\neverything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of\noblong well.It was about eight o\'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of\nthe street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at\nthe angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the\nstreet, till you see them enter No."And when you see \'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up\nto Frances Baudoin\'s room--"\n\n"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman\nlives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked\nsister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather\nchange their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her\nsister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I\'ll wait for you at the tavern opposite the\nCloister, and we\'ll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I\'ll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,\nand I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"\n\n"Well, well--good luck to you!Don\'t forget the Fiver, the little passage\nnext to the dyer\'s shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end\nof the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon\nfound the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,\nlike all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and\nforwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor\nof the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special\ndegree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,\ntrickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp\nof straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet\non; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the\nsickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the\nputrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals\nin the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint\nrays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,\npoor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working\nclasses.A dyer occupied the\nground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the\nstench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans\nlodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four\nflights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by\na single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy\nwall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron\nrod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often\nwashed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a\nround iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden\ntable, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made\nof iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola\nBaudoin, Dagobert\'s son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several\nbranches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very\ncoarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier\'s wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously\nfashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with\ngreen cotton velvet (Agricola\'s first present to his mother), a few rush\nbottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,\nbrown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a\nworm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and\nhousehold utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so\nto the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two\nmattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press\ncontained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert\'s wife occupied all to herself a\nroom as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest\nand laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too\nhappy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and\nblankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker\'s.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and\ndamp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son\nAgricola\'s evening meal.Dagobert\'s wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of\nblue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white\nhandkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her\ncountenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of\nresignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a\nbetter, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had\nsucceeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son\nAgricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with\nadmirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later\nlife, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most\nviolent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost\nsuicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the\npresent), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn\nabout two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to\neducate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength\nnearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,\nand had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and\nGabriel prepared to enter the priest\'s seminary, under the active\npatronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances\nBaudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those\nsimple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial\napproaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life\nof martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart\nsupply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme\nsimplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed\nin yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had\nnow for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence\nas most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,\ncould have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the\nsubject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every\nargument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her\ndisposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be\nshaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but\nuninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and\ndangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much\nevil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the\nincreasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;\nunable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest\nof her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been\nworking to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth\nfor her son\'s supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from\nthe press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much\nbattered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut\nlike a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she\nrubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her\nson\'s plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much\nfor what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the\nassociations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,\nunder the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been\ncompelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker\'s.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,\nand one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her\nson\'s plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the\nsupper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his\nmother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the\nredness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long\nand painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the\nconviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,\nwould soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or\nthree hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her\neyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts\nof work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she\nhad at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags\nfor the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the\nrate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,\nbeing very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and\nher gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,\nwhose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or\nsickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices\nto bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains\ndiminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and\ninfirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate\nworkman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his\nlabor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double\nwhat was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting\ntherefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain\nboth her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself\neven some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously\nliberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of\nvisiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had\nmasses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been\nso long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she\nconsidered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a\nheart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in\nthis respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never\ncomplained when he saw a great part of his week\'s wages (which he paid\nregularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect\nas tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations\ninjurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional\nexpenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when\nshe replied with tears: "My child, \'tis for the salvation of your father\nand yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a\nsubject which Agricola, through respect for his mother\'s religious faith,\nnever discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her\ndispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very\nmuch deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her\nbreast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was\nregular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it\nexpressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with\nkindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest\nwoman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse\nnet at the back of her head.Though\nmiserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful\nstruggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty\nfrock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it\nhad been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long\nsince disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a\nlong familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of\ntaunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said\nthat she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every\nmoment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though\nthey felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,\nnever called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the\nhouse in which Dagobert\'s wife had resided for more than twenty years;\nand she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very\npretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow\nof a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she\ntreated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would\noften come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console\nher, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother\'s example, instead of imitating\nother children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola\nand Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when\ntheir mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was\nintelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the\nlively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and\npleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances\'s good advice, resigned herself to\nher lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a\nyear.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her\ninsignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her\nto--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,\npretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and\nseductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to\nsatisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without\nbeing obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome\nhovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer\'s clerk, who\nforsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom\nshe (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,\nwhom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with\nchanging and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,\nwas the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired\nsuch a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her\ndecision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all\nkinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was\ntermed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of\nthis bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare\nintervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain\nher three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing\nby Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For\nthese she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,\nprovided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at\nthe most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely\nsucceeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an\nexcessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and\nfourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental\nnor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women\'s work\nis an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid\nnot half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,\nand makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can\nwork as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because\ntheir need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,\ntoiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in\nkeeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and\npoverty--so numerous were her privations.The word\nprivation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all\nthat is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome\nair and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all\nthat is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society\nought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman\nand workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all\nterritorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at\nleast, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the\nsea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for\nshelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,\nconsidering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard\ndaily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable\nhim to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life\nfrom the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,\nand disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes\nthus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its\ncareless disregard of all the questions which concern the just\nremuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl\ncontrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate\nwretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which\nleaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,\nwhether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame\nthe poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because\nthey are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:\n\n    Six pounds of bread, second quality..0 8 1/2\n    Four pails of water..0 2\n    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5\n    Coarse salt..0 0 3/4\n    A bushel of charcoal..0 4\n    A quart of dried vegetables..0 3\n    Three quarts of potatoes..0 2\n    Dips..0 3 1/4\n    Thread and needles..0 2 1/2\n                                                      ______\n                                                       2 7\n\nTo save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a\nweek at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week\nfor clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one\nrespect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might\nnot wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the\nhousekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a\nsmall bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five\nshillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the\nporter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which\nwas twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a\nmonth left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is\nless fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a\npiece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at\nnight patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room\ncontaining five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as\nmale lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the\ndisgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she\nmust submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms\nfor females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must\npossess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,\nout of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely\nsufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to\nclothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant\ncohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes\nweakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay\nlife," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving\nher intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"\nwho can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the\ndepravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the\nworking woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for\none day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost\nalways occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary\nattention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work\nimpossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in\nan hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind\nhesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and\noften of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again\nthis is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts\nwhole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human\ncreatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly\nenjoyed through Agricola\'s generosity, lived very miserably; and her\nhealth, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant\nhardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little\nsacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she\nearned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service\nwhich it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited\nmeans of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her\nnatural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and\nhumiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and\ngenerous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that\nthis was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been\nbrought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first\nconfidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and\nwhen he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic\nreverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong\nnatural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would\nbe to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola\'s great surprise, who had just read some verses to\nher, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to\nhim also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,\nperhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint\nentrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held\nfrequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but\nwith this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl\'s poetical\nessays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak\nintellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her\nunlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard\nlot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was\nespecially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of\nangelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the\ndouble burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere\nfree-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she\nadmired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of\nhers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine\nface; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous\nheart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The\nyoung girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can\nlove, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in\nthe depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She\ndid not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola\nexplained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one\nwas surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,\nAgricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people\'s flag, was brought\nbleeding home to his mother.Dagobert\'s son, deceived, like others, on\nthis point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this\nlove for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was\npreparing her son\'s supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:\nhave you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola\'s mother, and replied: "I was very busy\nabout some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only\njust finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want\nanything while I\'m out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past\neight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He\nkills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight\nis quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot\nsee at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son\ndrives me distracted.""Oh, don\'t, ma\'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"\n\n"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my\nvexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the\nadvantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy\'s, his good and worthy\nmaster--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light\nat noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,\na good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the\ngarden.not to mention that this place is so\nfar from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said\nMother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he\nwas born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the\nbuilding put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I\'ll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good\nmother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from\ntoil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of\nage, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and\naquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to\nDagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he\nwore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his\nchin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a\nblue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly\nround his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his\ndress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working\nhabiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he\nheld in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove\non which her son\'s simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very\nanxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won\'t excuse me for keeping the nice little supper\nwaiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you\'ll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I\'ll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I\'m so\nfond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with\nMother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put\naway the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at\nit, admire it, and especially smell it.You can\'t have a sweeter perfume;\na blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said\nFrances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think\nfolks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue\nBrise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances\'s\ncuriosity.Well, I\'ll satisfy you, and explain why I\ncame home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening\nof adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,\ngentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about\ndusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my\nfist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its\npaws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that\ndid not bear the master\'s name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small\ncollar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer\nmatch from my \'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, \'FRISKY belongs\nto Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I\ncame to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a\nsmall door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at\nthe other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,\nlooking up I saw \'No.7,\' newly painted over a little door with a grated\nslide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me\nthrough the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),\nthe gate opened.And now, you\'ll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of\nelfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my\nadventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that\nshe did not perceive her son\'s supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a\nyoung lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and\ngracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful\nportrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, \'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will\nbe!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an\nopportunity to thank you in person!\'And without giving me time to reply,\nshe beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my\npower to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small\nsaloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I\nwas so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and\nlight, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady\nof extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair\nshining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as\nsnow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so\ndazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.\'Madame,\' said the young\nwoman, whom I never should have taken for a lady\'s-maid, she was dressed\nso elegantly, \'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him\nback.\'\'Oh, sir,\' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet\nsilvery voice, \'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to\nFrisky.\'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank\nme in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to\nme, though I must confess with some hesitation--\'No doubt, sir, it gave\nyou some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some\nvaluable time--allow me--\' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my\nlooks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent\nporcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone\nfull of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed\nat having wounded me, she said--\'At least, sir, you will accept this\nflower.\'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary\nerror could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she\nunderstood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring\nto raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady\'s kind manner,\nthere was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall\nand dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the\nred-haired young lady, \'He is here, Madame.\'She immediately rose and\nsaid to me, \'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am\nindebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all\noccasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.\'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young\nwoman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there\nI stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had\ncome out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma\'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did\nnot observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on\nseeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done\nin her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and\nfeeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and\ngenerous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any\nimportant case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,\ntowards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,\nseemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within\nthe reach of a work, girl\'s vision; but, making an involuntary comparison\nof this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt\nmore cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and\ngentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made\nher feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the\npurse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had\natoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the\nmagnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a\ncharming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the\npainful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my\nadventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now\nfor the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot\nof the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with\nan air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking\nabout the house like a spy, \'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?\'said I: \'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful\ngreen, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?\'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don\'t know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade\nDaddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since\nit could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or\nnot."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,\ncontaining his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,\nrecovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to\nthe blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected\ngesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid\nblush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this\nhandsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously\ngave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do\nyou give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as\na pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by\nthe charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to\nthink I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this\nflower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took\nthe flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke\nand steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,\npointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,\nlaughing,-"Here\'s cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses\nyesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,\nwhile Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid\nthe flower against the side of it."Can\'t you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,\n"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the\nbetter for a little cooling to-night, won\'t it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son\'s\nhead, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she\nsurveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly\non the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is\nlate.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every\nevening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a\ngood apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since\nI sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better\nseat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread\nfor her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two\nexcellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only\njust dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form\'s sake--you have your whims--we can never\nprevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all\nalone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of\nstockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard\nday\'s toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,\nduring his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast\nwithout complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman\naccordingly observed with satisfaction:\n\n"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we\'ll have\nsome more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of\nluxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do\nto-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem\nvery sad, dear mother, and I can\'t make it out--I fancy you are not\nsatisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"\n\n"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little\namusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you\ndid last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of\nbitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said\nFrances to her son.I don\'t propose the theatre; but they say\nthere is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will\nsimply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly\nthree months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without\nus.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the\neyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this\nrefusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you\nto a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck\nhis forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed\npunctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his\nmother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and\nnights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she\nmight not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,\nthus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum\nof her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that\nthe poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man\nretorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,\nstoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give\nto the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary\nto avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola\nleft his mother\'s arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,\nsize, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge\nfist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain\nattempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the\namusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of\nhisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with\nAgricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may\nconceive the blacksmith\'s regret at having thus unwittingly revived the\nmemory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than\nAgricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity\nhad been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and\nresolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful\nthat thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,\nholding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my\nheedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two\nhearty kisses.The poor girl\'s lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart\nbeat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the\ntable."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection\nof that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd\nhad sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl\'s relief, without knowing\nit, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which\nhad now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse\ngrenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave\nfather; I can\'t believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me\ntopsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you\nhave had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her\nhead sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your\nfather.""Well, I\'m in for it this evening.\'Tis your turn now; positively, I am\ngrowing stupid, or going crazy.That\'s the\nonly word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on\ncertain subjects, it is because I can\'t help it; for I know well the pain\nit gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend\none\'s mother; and, with respect to what I said about father\'s return, I\ndo not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he\ndictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he\ntold us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,\nin that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he\nexpected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,\nthree or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I\nmight go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I\'ll tell you more:\nI should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the\nsame time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,\nmother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier\'s shako and\nmoustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon\nof his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the\nshining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at\nhis age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think\nthat he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn\'t there a room here for you and for him;\nand a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of\ndomestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness\nto his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel\ncome home, you won\'t want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned\nfor them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco\nto smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will\ntake a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,\nand, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the\nblacksmith."\'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,\nno ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should\ncover missus\'s floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what\'s he to us?""No; I think he\'s gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can\'t see him.But that\'s not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the\ndyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his\neyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance\nexpressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a\nmoment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances\'s sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the\nchange her son\'s countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more\ndiscernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the\nsempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me\nyou will be calm."Mother Bunch was\nright--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her\nhands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"\n\nThe blacksmith could not go on.\'What is the matter?--you\nterrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying\nhis eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command\nyour feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and\nemotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its\nbeating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and\nassisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a\ndistance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances\nchanged color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you\nhave only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"\nsaid Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will\ntell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to\napprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the\nsurprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he\nis there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely\nbeen able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running\nto the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband\'s arms, Frances fell on her knees in\nprayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her\nprayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of\nthis scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of\nrespect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did\nnot dare to fall on his father\'s neck.He waited with constrained\nimpatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they\nunderstood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son\nexpressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who\nin the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the\ncreature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the\nkneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at\nthe thought of Agricola\'s happiness, withdrew into the most obscure\ncorner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out\nof place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards\nher husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn\nsilence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but\na few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked\nup, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete\nenjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish\nand violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the\norphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them\nwith astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the\ndaughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,\napproaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert\'s wife, more and more\nastonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some\ndifficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as\nadmiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and\nhis son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted\nonly to look in Agricola\'s face; while he rested his hands on the young\nblacksmith\'s broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his\nfrank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand\nagain, exclaiming, "He\'s a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted\nlook he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola\'s happiness; but\nshe feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his\nson were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes\nfrom the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything\nso winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased\nher surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,\nMother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,\nunfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the\norphans\' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to\nthe feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to\nmake herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the\ncupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small\npieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few\nembers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw\nand blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,\npresuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did\nall this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so\nforgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely\noccupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its\nwarmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the\ncoffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish\nDagobert\'s wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she\ncould lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her\nnotice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there\'s Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he\nwants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After\nhaving rubbed Dagobert\'s hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet\nRose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they\ntook but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood\napart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular\nsaying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked\nthe hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By\na singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted\nher long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent\ndog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done\nall the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome\nflower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so\ndiscreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of\nmutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the\nrealities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did\nnot expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of\nGeneral Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for\nwith Agricola\'s garret--"\n\n"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it\nmust be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into\nnot being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm\nand arm, and I\'ll answer for it he won\'t walk the more upright and\nstraight of the two, and find out General Simon\'s father, at M. Hardy\'s\nfactory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory\neither M. Hardy or Marshall Simon\'s father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon\'s friends have secured him the\ntitle and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise\nme; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the\nleast they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my\nheart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You\narrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would\nhardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little\nduchesses!Ah, father Simon must have\nbeen very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his\nson again; for it was during the general\'s absence that his friends\nobtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,\nfor the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes\nfilled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we\nnot find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established\nin the south; but we expect them back every day."that\'s vexing; I relied on seeing the general\'s father, to\ntalk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where\nto write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his\ngranddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the\nsoldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you\nmust put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse\noff here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,\nsince here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my\nchildren.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,\nby any means.But, patience, patience; you\'ll find Paris not so bad as it\nlooks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in\nParis will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,\nguessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and\nlatterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,\n"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other\nthings, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,\nin his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of\nsaying\'my boy\'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my\nbrave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,\npoor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with\nyour own.""Don\'t talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I\'ll make you amends for it by and by.\'Tis down to\nyour account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow\nmorning."cried the blacksmith; "who\'ll say, after\nthis, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to\nmeet him, father?""I\'ll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if\nyou expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You\'ll give me half your room, and\na fine chat we\'ll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is\naccustomed to sleep at the children\'s door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the\nyoung ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the\ncook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm\nyou a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have\nnothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to\nbed; while they do so, I\'ll go to my boy\'s room, and, before Rose and\nBlanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give\nAgricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:\nshe is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with\na respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking\nfor a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you\nmight have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,\nperhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I\nregret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"\n\n"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do\nyou want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at\nmy blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought\nher proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young\nperson is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to\nnight; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"\n\n"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be\nassured that--"\n\n"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse\nthe length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed\nhis moustache with pride."But that does not\nastonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again\ndirected a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and\nDagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground\nfor herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,\nassisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola\nhaving previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who\npreceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother\nBunch\'s room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him\nrapidly, in a low tone:\n\n"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did\nnot hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old\nsoldier said to him,\n\n"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did\nnot light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to\nnight;" and the soldier, not noticing his son\'s surprise, went into the\nlittle room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over\npolite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced\ntowards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances\nBaudoin\'s; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep\nwith her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will\nshare the young blacksmith\'s room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on\nthe subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to\nlearn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the\npost about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin\'s\nconfessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at\nRue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it\nis on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to\nRodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described\nthe most profound silence reigned in the soldier\'s humble dwelling.A\nflickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,\nbetrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy\nrecess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except\nby this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with\nthe roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so\nnearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be\nseated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl\nwas carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a\nlinen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple\ncalix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were\nfeebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who\nhad taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks\nwere downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one\nhand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened\nwith painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of\nAgricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,\nusually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion\nby which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a\nletter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by\npost in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the\nhousekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some\ntrivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his\nfamily.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly\nopened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low\nvoice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But\nwhat is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she\nhastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the\nlight, and read what follows:\n\n"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the\nsisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of\nto-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied\namazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his\neyes:-"The song, entitled \'Working-men Freed,\' has been declared\nlibellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a\nsecret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as\nbeing concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who\nwas lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,\ndoubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses\nbreathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found\namong the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the\nletter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:\n\n"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo\ndoubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be\nwell if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in\norder that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to\ntrial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,\nwhose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment\'s silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance\nresumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good\nMother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on\nme.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the\ntime.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating\ntone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and\nlisten to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two\nmonths since my song was published.It is not in any way political;\nindeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming\ndown on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is\nscarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very\nneighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the\nverses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the\npossession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more\nis necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the\nlove of labor and of goodness!If so, justice\nwould be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be\nnecessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim\'s staff to guide her\nsteps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on\nhearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to\nme!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you\ndo also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor\nlaborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;\nyou recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble\nheart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and\nthe wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your\nwishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than\nyou, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these\ntimes of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than\nthat numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the\npersons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an\nexcellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view\nwith more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And\nthen, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite\ninsignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for\nconspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and\nhe was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has\nfurnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the\nletter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be\nnaturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,\nand poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them\nwithout you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the\nletter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error\nthough it be, is not the less cruel.But they don\'t commit a man without\nhearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,\nbitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his\ndaily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in\nprison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my\nmother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family\nuntil the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.\nHardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,\nthat, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their\npersecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a\njourney with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,\nadded: "But no!After all, I had\nrather await what may come.I\'ll at least have the chance of proving my\ninnocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it\nbe that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my\nfamily will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen\nto-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep\nso joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch\'s fears were too well-founded, for it will be\nrecollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue\ndes Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made\namong the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against\ndemocratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some\nseconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an\nindefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she\nshowed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with\nso much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a\ngenerous heart.You must apply to her--"\n\nWith these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort\nover herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in\nher life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman\nwas so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she\nidolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done\nwith this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "\'Remember my name; and\nin all circumstances address yourself to me?\'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful\nconnections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to\nmorrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her\nsupport.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had\nsaved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for\nhim.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your\ninnocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you\nwill have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person\nto whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what\ncould possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you\nunderstand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose\nthat you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety\nfor you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your\nemployment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,\nAgricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is\nnoble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is\ngenerous.The required surety will be\nas nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be\nthe very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and\ndejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the\nyoung lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will\nindeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I\'d never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I\nrendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the\nservices which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust\nto me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is\ntrue, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any\nother person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am\nsure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far\nabove me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;\nyes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel\none; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that\nwhich I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly\nconsume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so\nheart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which\nthis unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,\nmade of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent\nyouth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,\nholding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,\n"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and\ndelicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those\nof a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over\ninto making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de\nCardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,\nthe sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely\nsweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally\ndevoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,\nthey sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the\nworld is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and\naffection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably\nblissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to\nhardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of\nthemselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young\nlady\'s house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I\'ll go down to watch at the\nstreet-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you\nof what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your\nfather," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,\nis so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your\npresent concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola\'s garret, that he and\nthe sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:\n\n"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is\nover; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet\nhim.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether\nor not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress\'s\napartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest\nits noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,\ngayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my\ndear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not\nseen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a\nnew pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be\nlike seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola\'s garret\nbeing now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed\nnot an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in\norder that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite\nof her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to\nsink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the\nconversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom\nshe secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she\npossessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she\nloved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that\nshe should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found\nconsolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,\nshe rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order\nto see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear\nand cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola\'s\ngarret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be\nseen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the\nsewing-girl\'s.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which\nAgricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a\nnail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the\npeople revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has\ndelighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their\nreverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had\nalready risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his\ninquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number\nof precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of\nAgricola\'s song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the\ndisconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the\nyoung blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,\nsuspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the\nedge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had\ndressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both\nthose of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to\ndiscontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I\nwished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in\nfull day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear\nmoustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;\nhave you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That\'s right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look\nye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good\nfor nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old\ncarbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;\nand then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is\nsomething good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for\nthe cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this\nis but the beginning!I am like the famished\nwretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and\nlittle that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to\nbe tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,\nI wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and\nperplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed\nthat they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was\nmenaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good\nto you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more\nequitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in\nhis factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies\nof Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what\naffection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;\nwho work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor\npleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,\nhe accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;\nwhence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that\nis not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in\nwhich all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful\nand salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an\nassociation.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"\nobserved Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good\nmother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a\nsigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have\nsuffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well\nin the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You\nshall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in\nbeholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold\nfather and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You\nwill write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his\ngrand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should\nhasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which\nare of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down\nto say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes\nto be regular at that: the good soul!and\nduring her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of\nmy power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to\nattend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required\nin a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.\nHardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought\nto make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must\nbe deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which\nsustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and\nspoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put\noff for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only\nhoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l\'amour et cogni--I mean--my\nAgricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his\nson\'s shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one\nmoment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now\nthat I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of\nbusiness.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in\nParis?""I don\'t know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and\nby order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some\nimportant papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this\nnotary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his\naddress in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my\njourney; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,\nthat if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect\nit."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He\ninvoluntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had\nnot perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed\nhat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,\nwere two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as\nthought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,\nwhile they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes\nbecome moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the\nyoung men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and\naspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola\ncontrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at\nlength."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a\nhundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping\nfor it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands\nof Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a\nhundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting\nhis fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of\nineffable affection, Dagobert added:\n\n"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel\nhas the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he\nsaved the lives of Marshal Simon\'s daughters, and tried to save mine\nalso."suddenly exclaimed\nAgricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the\nmissionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly\nbeneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through\nwhich shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which\nextended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting\nevents which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near\nCardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with\nGabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the\nyoung missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,\nDagobert said:\n\n"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with\nrenewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest\nheld out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has\nwounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the\nmissionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of\nwounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken\ndown alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon\nwhich the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and\nagony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to\nthis upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands\nhave been pierced through!and Agricola became\ngrievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment\nof modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky\nMountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when\nProvidence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a\nsufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;\n"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it\nthat they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,\nscarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own\nsense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be\nimplanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion\nthat the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in\nhim, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the\nblessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which\nwas uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism\nthus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now\ncontemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration\nand respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite\nunconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his\ntwo friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:\n"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to\nbe about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don\'t you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took\nwith transport both of Gabriel\'s hands), "that these wounds are as\nglorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by\nprofession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,\nwith enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their\nresignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have\ngone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under\nthe eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with\nme?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self\npreservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the\nshouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes\nof the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,\nwhich bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state\nthat I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every\none--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough\nhide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you\nnot a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,\nunarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those\nwhom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by\nartillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to\nGabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify\nwhat was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have\nhearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the\nmost admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,\nalone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity\nand Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await\ndeath and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,\nwithout hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness\nissuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and\nthis in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your\nmagnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you\nwere rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black\nrobe!can you still contend that you are not\nas brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a\nthankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never\nchange his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to\nDagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense\nawaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I\nwill not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would\nbe at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like\nGabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much\nvirtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood\ninsolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind\ndevotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who\nare inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly\nlawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their\nvocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand\nenfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we\nare, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your\nambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you\nunderstand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"\nand then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change\nthe conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:\nbe more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your\ncourage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the\nspectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling\nheart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,\nlooked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most\nsurprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind\nwhat I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I\nadvanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night\nafter a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by\nnight,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our\npossession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of\nthe slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of\nmy old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has\nrestored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious\nwhirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,\n\'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?\'But this\nfeeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following\nmorning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once\nmore to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm\nbecame weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my\nhorse, I have said to myself, \'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old\nsoldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during\nthe solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man\nis left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his\nbosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are\ngreatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have\nnever abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the\nclaws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,\nthat the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my\nrequest, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied\nthe missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to\nmake you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived\nby a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I\nawaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must\nhave been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has\nremained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I\nshould have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"\n\nDagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he\nalso had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had\nfreed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,\nyoung and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, \'I am the sister of the\ndistressed!\'"asked Dagobert, singularly\ninterested."\'I go wheresoever there is suffering,\' she replied," answered\nthe missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of\nAmerica--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,\nwhere the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also\nto have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means\ndid this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was\nheard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the\nfears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted\nbrother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to\nspeak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch\'s voice, and opened the door.But\nthe young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark\npassage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour\nsince broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have\nbeen watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing\nalarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure\nyou, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But\nI could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been\nstated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father\nand me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your\nmother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young\nladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother\nhas requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not\ndelay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came\nto arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should\ndepart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were\nforgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,\nperhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to\nyourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I\'ll come down."I\'ll come up\nagain to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,\nto resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his\ngarret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received\nthis letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:\n\n"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon\nwith an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your\nhusband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres\nwithout a moment\'s delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to\nno other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General\nSimon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can\nhave told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you\ntransmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address\nwas Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,\n"if he has some important documents, why didn\'t he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as\npossible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would\nwithdraw his father for about two days, during which time his\n(Agricola\'s) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it\nis not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is\nrequired on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall\nbe back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for\nChartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and\nGabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them\ncompany.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This\nvisit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not\npossible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing\na sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again\ninto this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something\nin thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the\nshipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you\nenrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of\nthe name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in\nCardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return\nthanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the\nperson to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady\nshould be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made\nto Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is\nalready late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o\'clock."This party is adjourned till my\nreturn from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the\nlatter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him\nto shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him\nsolemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished\nboth the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I\nhave come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall\nhave need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"\nadded Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of\nhonor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I\nnot?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will\nyou come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the\naccents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If\nhe should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,\nwhat could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon\nus," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father\nand a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I\'ll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest\'s\nrobe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,\nthat you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and\nfearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A\nFATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually\nincreasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de\nCardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,\nin Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing\nthan the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with\nsmall squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre\neffect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which\nthe fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected\nin the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was\nsurmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which\nwas reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which\nan arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front\noverlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,\non this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,\nformed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great\nhabitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the\ngarden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a\nrotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its\nerection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the\nstones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of\nflowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de\nCardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a\nperistyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,\nlighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of\nsmaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or\ntransformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,\nthe black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the\nentire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built\nglistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect\ncontrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity\nof an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic\nclumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following\nthat of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in\nthe Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a\nneighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue\nsky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of\nverdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the\nrays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon\ntwo charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place\nin the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its\nown, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them\na young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that\nbreed of spaniels called King Charles\'s, made their appearance under the\nperistyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the\nbeautiful little spaniel\'s was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth\nyear.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady\'s maid of Marivaux, a\nmore mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth\nmore white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or\nform smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,\nGeorgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,\nwith flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with\nrose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful\nfair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray\nlevantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large\ntuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a\nhollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,\nsurmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and\nflexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,\nallowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,\nreaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When\nGeorgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more\nquickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky\'s indifferent eyes a beautiful\nankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in\nwhite silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish\nsatin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when\nvivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a\njoyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless\nfor the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady\'s-maid, who on the previous evening had\nintroduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the\nHonorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint\nDizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak\nbut joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was\nnot much bigger than one\'s fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,\nshone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her\nneck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery\ntan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her\nlarge eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that\nthey trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and\npetulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after\nthe happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon\nthe greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,\nwho advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly\nstopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in\nadvance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held\nherself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up\nof the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,\nthough of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy\nconsisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the\ncolor of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was\npot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;\nhe walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air\nof a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs\nsallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and\naltogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a\n"church-goer\'s pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a\nwoman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was\ndressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay\nand showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat\nof the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in\nher youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,\nwhich were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and\naustere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and\ndiscreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess\nSaint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two\nwomen present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even\nto the animals which attended them.There were similar differences\nbetween Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When\nthe latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a\nmovement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the\nyoung lady\'s maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the\napparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,\nand even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the\ncur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of\ndistress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly\nsaid to Georgette:\n\n"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog\nthus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly\nanimal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky\nyesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,\nand brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to\nwhat, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal\na smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It\nregards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to\nherself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight\nstart of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied\nwith watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl\nat with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome\nher temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very\nlate last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid\nday.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order\nof the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken\nyour mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one\'s orders in her own house; and I will\nnot disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied\nGeorgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the\nsaloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne\nbe entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the\nPrincess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my\nmistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her\nniece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer\nrespects her aunt\'s orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained\npersons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if\nfor ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest\ncoquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess\'s women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having\nbeen handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even\nunto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a\nhundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the\nutmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess\'s house, who has\ntoo many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought\nnot to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"\n\n"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o\'clock--"\n\n"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the\nhouse.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,\nand directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter\'s\nlodge window; and at one o\'clock in the morning, the cab was still\nstationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the\ncloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing\nthe name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the\nPrincess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the\nmiddle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris\nof General Simon\'s daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it\nnecessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her\nshoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not\ncome here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will\nyou, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me\nto enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a\nspot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,\nterminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,\nextending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her\ngait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o\'clock in the\nmorning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into\nfits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my\nstory of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"\n\n"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that\nopen\'s on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is\nby that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments\nhave not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her\nniece\'s caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,\nthough I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe\nit!""Since you\'ve gone so far, ma\'am, I now insist upon conducting you into\nthe apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by\nyour own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by\nthis time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"\n\n"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor\nHebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end\nto this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has\npassed.Re-enter at eight o\'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own\neyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be\nexpected.All those to whom I am\ngoing to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all\nastonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her\nfat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in\norder to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or\nfancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to\nhave seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of\nSaint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,\nthe following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the\nlight some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss\nde Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined\nto a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an\ninsatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and\nbeautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the\nsculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne\ndid the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites\nin the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to\ngratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,\nthe cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh\nvoice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or\none nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from\nthe sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of\ntheir sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally\nwith the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,\nalas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She\nvalued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the\ndelicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous\ncluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She\nsought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She\nwould have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by\nexcesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which\nto exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the\nexcessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and\nEVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to\nthe adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad\npassion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are\nin themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the\nexpression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification\nof SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken\nsensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the\nnecessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite\nsensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady\'s character was extreme.Certain\nhumiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,\nabove all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to\nresolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish\nthat it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her\naudacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well\nas in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and\nblindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose\npiquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who\nentertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either\nplaced very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met\nin the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she\nresided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into\nthe presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the\nbath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to\nrepresent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred\nin the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in\nParis, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne\'s dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one\nerected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker\nwho has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,\nor to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the\ncontact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,\nwith fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she\nmay enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the\nsplendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own\nperfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this\nsemicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived\nfor the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls\nof the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth\nof the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of\nAdrienne\'s dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a\nsingle large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of\nground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between\nthese two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with\nfurze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round\nthe ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet\ndamask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest\nstyle, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended\nover the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,\nmarvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and\ndecorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne\'s dressing\ncase, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large\ntablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids\nprecisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other\nimplements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of\nmother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in\nextraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique\npurity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place\nof a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed\nevery day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in\ndiameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,\nfilled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed\na sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the\nfarther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,\nsurrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the\nenchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful\nmodesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported\nthose two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with\nsmall figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet\nof gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two\nfrosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent\ndrawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting\nof portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles\nof oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver\ngilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich\ndivan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture\nof this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the\nsweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated\nbefore her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or\nrather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was\nwith the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished\nthe young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with\nattention and with a charming originality.We have already seen\nGeorgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an\nintriguing lady\'s maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite\nequal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,\nwith the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a\nlong golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to\nfacilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her\ncharming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the\nVenetian painters.Her slender waist curved\nin from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five\nminute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne\'s\nwomen had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so\npleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of\nHebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her\ncharming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The\nphysiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On\ntheir features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing\nand hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded\ndeference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the\nzealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon\nAdrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of\ndeference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from\nthe services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have\nthought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her\nperson all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a\nwork of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they\nwere stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the\nwindow.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more\nthan usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,\nembroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her\nwaist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve\nyears, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and\nflexible as a bird\'s, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,\nand all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the\ncomparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling\nwhiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,\nthat some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots\nof her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,\nlike pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to\nauburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the\nroseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her\nnails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every\nspot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,\ncould make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it\nproclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her\nglorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now\nthey glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and\nwit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and\nswimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep\na black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a\ndelightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to\ncontrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those\nof ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect\noval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of\nher teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth\nvoluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles\nand delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to\nbehold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more\nelegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck\nand the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness\nof many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da\nVinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more\ndelightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating\nmass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when\nlet loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,\nlike another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,\nAdrienne\'s tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,\nstood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her\nsmall white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent\nbrightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady\'s-maid\npulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves\nof that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a\nthousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all\ndirections.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays\nfrom numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne\'s\nforehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed\nthe risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they\nadapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the\nbeautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and\nhaving upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied\nherself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and\ncrossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh\ncolor, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled\nbox, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling\nhands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their\nextremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her\nmistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe\nthe different operations of Adrienne\'s toilette with grave and reflective\nattention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign\nfrom her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon\na small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on\nher shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took\nthe letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,\nand read aloud as follows:\n\n"HONORED MADAME,\n\n"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you\nwith respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count\nand Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,\nwith probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in\nour old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute\nof all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my\nfather, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and\ntheir probity."She continued:\n\n"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;\nbut it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the\nconsequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase\nour bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in\npoverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because\nit has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted\nfrom us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin\ncame here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself\nanew; "the secretary of Abbe d\'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him\nbeing engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and\nthat he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if\nwe would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the\nnew proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain\nthis end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and\nexcellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and\nto relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to\nacknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much\nas possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious\npretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill\nit was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and\nsubstantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said\nAdrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without\ninvoluntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,\nand vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I\nlove to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:\n\n"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has\nbeen our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like\nhonest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,\nhonored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who\nare so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your\nrecommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from\na position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To\nwrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but\na pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and\ndearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on\nreading:\n\n"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us\nto implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked\nto think only of one\'s self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place\nupon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were\nconducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still\nremains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,\nand, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He\nis a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he\nappears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a\nlittle to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his\ncountrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of\nan ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened\nall my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of\nthe Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne\'s three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they\nwere accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her\npretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,\nas if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and\nrecollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully\ninterested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had\ncalled him, continued to read Dupont\'s letter:\n\n"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to\nattend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has\nlost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to\nParis, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very\ngreatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have\nobtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud\nto proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,\nconfidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young\ncompatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his\nfather, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by\nthe English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These\ncircumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one\nof our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that\nGeneral Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his\nservice."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,\n"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things\nhappen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon\ncreature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in\ntruth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy\nDupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we\nshould have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our\nown griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave\nand estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust\nto me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only\nnecessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of\ncountenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy\nof the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the\npurchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian\nvestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent\nhither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have\nworn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful\nhats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is\nnot a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what\ncan either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome\nyoung prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and\ncashmere.Most assuredly I\'ll not miss this rare and unique opportunity\nof exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the\nname--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is\nthis!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he\nmerits!"And then she read on:\n\n"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give\nhim, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer\na very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so\nunfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would\nperhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without\nbeing known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be\npleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the\ncontrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it\nhas been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja\nsing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her\nrecollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names\nthat my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing\nmore chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by\nmarriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that\ncharacter.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are\nnot so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or\nconfound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid\nEuropean dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty\nfairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our\ndismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him\nof his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of\nher women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The\nyoung girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials\nfor writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I\nawait orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the\ngayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to\na meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of\ndrawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in\nall others:\n\n"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,\nwith that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever\ndistinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who\ndesigned my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present\naffair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,\nsir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy\nthat you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,\nfrom the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and\ncorrectness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will\nchoose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all\nthings, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you\nwill add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere\nshawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits\nbrown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you\nwill depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you\nknow so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,\nwill there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you\nwill tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another\nquarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown\nfriend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is\nnecessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will\nadd, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures\nhim to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you\nwill tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will\ncause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he\nfinds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the\nunknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,\nmodestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at\nthe opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though\nthis must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey\nas rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de\nBabylone (what predestination!Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.that I should dwell in the street of\nBABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an\nOriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so\nhappy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to\nbe at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in\nextravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you\nin this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is\nbecause it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,\nthere is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and\ndignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly\nresumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient\ndays, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me\ndraw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of\nbattle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to\nmy dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed\nme, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere\nprincess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to\nunderstand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of\nthis running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is\nproper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that\nhe is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine\nexpression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves\n(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble\ngenerosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,\nthat I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that\nGeorgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an\norder upon her banker, which was expressed thus:\n\n"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may\nrequire for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had\ncontinued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress\'s\ntoilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in\norder to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and\nimmovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne\'s\ndictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been\nseen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her\nmemory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the\ndoor of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to\nexecute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine\nprecipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her\nleaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:\n\n"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go\nto the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,\nseal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the\nletter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky\nyesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and\nhe appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the\nlittle reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected\nher, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep\nblue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with\ninterlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her\nnymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,\nfastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a\nnecklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair\ncountenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral\ntresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him\nbelieve that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been\nobliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse\nthough, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell\nover upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his\nwell polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a\ncap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,\nembroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young\nblacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful\nfolds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and\nbecame him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have\ndone.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a\nmagnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same\nmetal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased\nby JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only\nseparated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not\nperceived the young lady\'s entrance.He started, and turned quickly\nround, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a\nbeautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de\nCardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an\nartist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the\ntitle-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have\nhis name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order\nof a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at\nmy eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after\nhaving made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I\nordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the\ngoldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of\nthe rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation\nmore graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a\nlittle more at ease, answered:\n\n"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such\na proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but\nfelicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple\nsilk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of\nthe same materials.Seeing Agricola\'s hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with\nembarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to\nhim gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,\nwill always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,\nsir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what\ngood presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure\nof being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in\nthe employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you\noffered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of\nyou perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the\ngreatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at\nease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if\nyou knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to\nme, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite\nof my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is\nthat is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,\nwho in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to\nbring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had\npicked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the\nhappiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am\ndragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself\nfor her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don\'t know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment\'s silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised\nair; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very\nindustrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is\ndeformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,\non the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the\nother, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain\nthat your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own\nthought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had\npresented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this\ncomparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could\nsay to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel\nmisfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,\nwhen we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we\nare rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will\nquickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was\nalways observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises\nfrom independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness\nof sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his\nprotectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate\nand kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and\nstriking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who\ninspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I\nshould not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory\nsuspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one\nanother; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our\nexcellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves\nare far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by\nassisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my\nmother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is\nnot only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,\nwhom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from\nSiberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to\nhis former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much\nsurprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his\ndaughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more\nastonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so\nsweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one\nanother.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having\nbeen confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths\nof Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget\nso many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of\na lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;\nthat which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my\nlabor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;\nbut that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent\nby some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been\nreceived by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with\nsurprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,\nwhen I return to my mother after a day\'s toil, and often, even while\nforging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse\nmyself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,\nis, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune\nto be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of\nhis workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the\nreverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass\nof the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest\nclaim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of\nconspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned\non very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will\nbecome of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to\nregard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal\nSimon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk\nof being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety\nfor me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for\nthe prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor\nwill suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself\nquite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in\nthe midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of\nall, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately\nconnected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"\nsaid she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor\nexercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has\nalways had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his\nhealth; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day\non which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly\nat ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some\nother means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for\nthe repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever\nbe grateful."It is proper that those\nwho have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who\nhave too little.Marshal Simon\'s daughters are members of my family, and\nthey will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will\napprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to\nthank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,\nI shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room\nfrom an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,\nexclaiming:\n\n"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said\nGeorgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the\nwalls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,\nas if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:\nand now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and\nare on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been\nacquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for\nMarshal Simon\'s daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything\nthe least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to\nbe voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But\nin any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and\nescape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my\nmeasures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep\npossession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man\nknocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse\nhas not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named\nAgricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great\nimportance.""That\'s my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a\ntrick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for\ntrick.added she, addressing herself to\nHebe."I answered, that I didn\'t know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is\nnecessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am\nunfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my\naunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is\nrendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the\ndaughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,\nyou will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to\naccept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the\npower of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come\nin; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I\nam no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her\nfears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves\nyou as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget\nthem also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your\nfamily.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by\ngiving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these\nannoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will\ncome and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a\nnobleman\'s left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,\n"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of\nconcealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all\nsearches.You will be very well\naccommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the\nplace inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your\nposition do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not\nowe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he\nhas bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you\nforget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you\nhave restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this\nsingular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are\nentirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother\'s, in\nthis pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if\nyou do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe\nbrought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for\nAdrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the\nPrincess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the\napartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,\nputting a paper into the duenna\'s hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o\'clock.""But before nine o\'clock she came home, after having passed the night out\nof her house.Eight o\'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do\nnot understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o\'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in\norder to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I\nknow nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your\ncompanions.They don\'t distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested\npermission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing\ndown all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn\'t you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew\nthe contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending\noff this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I\nhave been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very\ngreat mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:\n\n"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are\nfree."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and\nwith tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who\nplaced me here.""In spite of one\'s self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so\nconfiding."But you are not here to sing her\npraises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early\nthis morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview\nwhich she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of\nwhat she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,\nwithout Florine being able to hear her: "\'They laugh most who laugh\nlast.\'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would\ntremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I\nadvise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do\nyou a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer\nhouse, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.It seems probable that Kettledrummle allotted this part in the\nsuccess to his companions in adversity, lest they should be tempted to\ndisclose his carnal self-seeking and falling away, in regarding too\nclosely his own personal safety.These strong testimonies in favour of\nthe liberated captives quickly flew abroad, with many exaggerations,\namong the victorious army.The reports on the subject were various; but\nit was universally agreed, that young Morton of Milnwood, the son of the\nstout soldier of the Covenant, Silas Morton, together with the precious\nGabriel Kettledrummle, and a singular devout Christian woman, whom many\nthought as good as himself at extracting a doctrine or an use, whether of\nterror or consolation, had arrived to support the good old cause, with a\nreinforcement of a hundred well-armed men from the Middle Ward.[Note: Skirmish at Drumclog.This affair, the only one in which\n     Claverhouse was defeated, or the insurgent Cameronians successful,\n     was fought pretty much in the manner mentioned in the text.The\n     Royalists lost about thirty or forty men.The commander of the\n     Presbyterian, or rather Convenanting party, was Mr Robert Hamilton,\n     of the honourable House of Preston, brother of Sir William Hamilton,\n     to whose title and estate he afterwards succeeded; but, according to\n     his biographer, Howie of Lochgoin, he never took possession of\n     either, as he could not do so without acknowledging the right of\n     King William (an uncovenanted monarch) to the crown.Hamilton had\n     been bred by Bishop Burnet, while the latter lived at Glasgow; his\n     brother, Sir Thomas, having married a sister of that historian."He\n     was then," says the Bishop, "a lively, hopeful young man; but\n     getting into that company, and into their notions, he became a\n     crack-brained enthusiast."Several well-meaning persons have been much scandalized at the\n     manner in which the victors are said to have conducted themselves\n     towards the prisoners at Drumclog.But the principle of these poor\n     fanatics, (I mean the high-flying, or Cameronian party,) was to\n     obtain not merely toleration for their church, but the same\n     supremacy which Presbytery had acquired in Scotland after the treaty\n     of Rippon, betwixt Charles I. and his Scottish subjects, in 1640.The fact is, that they conceived themselves a chosen people, sent\n     forth to extirpate the heathen, like the Jews of old, and under a\n     similar charge to show no quarter.The historian of the Insurrection of Bothwell makes the following\n     explicit avowal of the principles on which their General acted:--\n\n     "Mr Hamilton discovered a great deal of bravery and valour, both in\n     the conflict with, and pursuit of, the enemy; but when he and some\n     other were pursuing the enemy, others flew too greedily upon the\n     spoil, small as it was, instead of pursuing the victory; and some,\n     without Mr Hamilton\'s knowledge, and directly contrary to his\n     express command, gave five of those bloody enemies quarter, and then\n     let them go; this greatly grieved Mr Hamilton when he saw some of\n     Babel\'s brats spared, after that the Lord had delivered them into\n     their hands, that they might dash them against the stones.Psalm\n     cxxxvii., 9.In his own account of this, he reckons the sparing of\n     these enemies, and letting them go, to be among their first\n     steppings aside, for which he feared that the Lord would not honour\n     them to do much more for him; and says, that he was neither for\n     taking favours from, nor giving favours to, the Lord\'s enemies."See\n     A true and impartial Account of the persecuted Presbyterians in\n     Scotland, their being in arms, and defeat at Bothwell Brigg, in\n     1679, by William Wilson, late Schoolmaster in the parish of Douglas.The reader who would authenticate the quotation, must not consult\n     any other edition than that of 1697; for somehow or other the\n     publisher of the last edition has omitted this remarkable part of\n     the narrative.Sir Robert Hamilton himself felt neither remorse nor shame for\n     having put to death one of the prisoners after the battle with his\n     own hand, which appears to have been a charge against him, by some\n     whose fanaticism was less exalted than his own."As for that accusation they bring against me of killing that poor\n     man (as they call him) at Drumclog, I may easily guess that my\n     accusers can be no other but some of the house of Saul or Shimei, or\n     some such risen again to espouse that poor gentleman (Saul) his\n     quarrel against honest Samuel, for his offering to kill that poor\n     man Agag, after the king\'s giving him quarter.But I, being to\n     command that day, gave out the word that no quarter should be given;\n     and returning from pursuing Claverhouse, one or two of these fellows\n     were standing in the midst of a company of our friends, and some\n     were debating for quarter, others against it.None could blame me to\n     decide the controversy, and I bless the Lord for it to this day.There were five more that without my knowledge got quarter, who were\n     brought to me after we were a mile from the place as having got\n     quarter, which I reckoned among the first steppings aside; and\n     seeing that spirit amongst us at that time, I then told it to some\n     that were with me, (to my best remembrance, it was honest old John\n     Nisbet,) that I feared the Lord would not honour us to do much more\n     for him.I shall only say this,--I desire to bless his holy name,\n     that since ever he helped me to set my face to his work, I never\n     had, nor would take, a favour from enemies, either on right or left\n     hand, and desired to give as few."The preceding passage is extracted from a long vindication of his\n     own conduct, sent by Sir Robert Hamilton, 7th December, 1685,\n     addressed to the anti-Popish, anti-Prelatic, anti-Erastian,\n     anti-sectarian true Presbyterian remnant of the Church of Scotland;\n     and the substance is to be found in the work or collection, called,\n     "Faithful Contendings Displayed, collected and transcribed by John\n     Howie."As the skirmish of Drumclog has been of late the subject of some\n     enquiry, the reader may be curious to see Claverhouse\'s own account\n     of the affair, in a letter to the Earl of Linlithgow, written\n     immediately after the action.This gazette, as it may be called,\n     occurs in the volume called Dundee\'s Letters, printed by Mr Smythe\n     of Methven, as a contribution to the Bannatyne Club.The original is\n     in the library of the Duke of Buckingham.Claverhouse, it may be\n     observed, spells like a chambermaid."FOR THE EARLE OF LINLITHGOW.[COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF KING CHARLES\n     II."My Lord,--Upon Saturday\'s night, when my Lord Rosse came into this\n     place, I marched out, and because of the insolency that had been\n     done tue nights before at Ruglen, I went thither and inquyred for\n     the names.So soon as I got them, I sent our partys to sease on\n     them, and found not only three of those rogues, but also ane\n     intercomend minister called King.We had them at Strevan about six\n     in the morning yesterday, and resolving to convey them to this, I\n     thought that we might make a little tour to see if we could fall\n     upon a conventicle; which we did, little to our advantage; for when\n     we came in sight of them, we found them drawn up in batell, upon a\n     most adventageous ground, to which there was no coming but through\n     mosses and lakes.They wer not preaching, and had got away all there\n     women and shildring.They consisted of four battaillons of foot, and\n     all well armed with fusils and pitchforks, and three squadrons of\n     horse.We sent both partys to skirmish, they of foot and we of\n     dragoons; they run for it, and sent down a battaillon of foot\n     against them; we sent threescore of dragoons, who made them run\n     again shamfully; but in end they percaiving that we had the better\n     of them in skirmish, they resolved a generall engadgment, and\n     imediately advanced with there foot, the horse folowing; they came\n     throght the lotche; the greatest body of all made up against my\n     troupe; we keeped our fyre till they wer within ten pace of us: they\n     recaived our fyr, and advanced to shok; the first they gave us\n     broght down the Coronet Mr Crafford and Captain Bleith, besides that\n     with a pitchfork they made such an openeing in my rone horse\'s\n     belly, that his guts hung out half an elle, and yet he caryed me af\n     an myl; which so discoraged our men, that they sustained not the\n     shok, but fell into disorder.There horse took the occasion of this,\n     and purseued us so hotly that we had no tym to rayly.I saved the\n     standarts, but lost on the place about aight or ten men, besides\n     wounded; but he dragoons lost many mor.They ar not com esily af on\n     the other side, for I sawe severall of them fall befor we cam to the\n     shok.I mad the best retraite the confusion of our people would\n     suffer, and I am now laying with my Lord Rosse.The toun of Streven\n     drew up as we was making our retrait, and thoght of a pass to cut us\n     off, but we took courage and fell to them, made them run, leaving a\n     dousain on the place.What these rogues will dou yet I know not, but\n     the contry was flocking to them from all hands.This may be counted\n     the begining of the rebellion, in my opinion."I am, my lord,\n\n     "Your lordship\'s most humble servant,\n\n     "J. Grahame."My lord, I am so wearied, and so sleapy, that I have wryton this\n     very confusedly."]When pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,\n               Was beat with fist instead of a stick.In the meantime, the insurgent cavalry returned from the pursuit, jaded\nand worn out with their unwonted efforts, and the infantry assembled on\nthe ground which they had won, fatigued with toil and hunger.Their\nsuccess, however, was a cordial to every bosom, and seemed even to serve\nin the stead of food and refreshment.It was, indeed, much more brilliant\nthan they durst have ventured to anticipate; for, with no great loss on\ntheir part, they had totally routed a regiment of picked men, commanded\nby the first officer in Scotland, and one whose very name had long been a\nterror to them.Their success seemed even to have upon their spirits the\neffect of a sudden and violent surprise, so much had their taking up arms\nbeen a measure of desperation rather than of hope.Their meeting was also\ncasual, and they had hastily arranged themselves under such commanders as\nwere remarkable for zeal and courage, without much respect to any other\nqualities.It followed, from this state of disorganization, that the\nwhole army appeared at once to resolve itself into a general committee\nfor considering what steps were to be taken in consequence of their\nsuccess, and no opinion could be started so wild that it had not some\nfavourers and advocates.Some proposed they should march to Glasgow, some\nto Hamilton, some to Edinburgh, some to London.Some were for sending a\ndeputation of their number to London to convert Charles II.to a sense of\nthe error of his ways; and others, less charitable, proposed either to\ncall a new successor to the crown, or to declare Scotland a free\nrepublic.A free parliament of the nation, and a free assembly of the\nKirk, were the objects of the more sensible and moderate of the party.In\nthe meanwhile, a clamour arose among the soldiers for bread and other\nnecessaries, and while all complained of hardship and hunger, none took\nthe necessary measures to procure supplies.In short, the camp of the\nCovenanters, even in the very moment of success, seemed about to dissolve\nlike a rope of sand, from want of the original principles of combination\nand union.Burley, who had now returned from the pursuit, found his followers in\nthis distracted state.With the ready talent of one accustomed to\nencounter exigences, he proposed, that one hundred of the freshest men\nshould be drawn out for duty--that a small number of those who had\nhitherto acted as leaders, should constitute a committee of direction\nuntil officers should be regularly chosen--and that, to crown the\nvictory, Gabriel Kettledrummle should be called upon to improve the\nprovidential success which they had obtained, by a word in season\naddressed to the army.He reckoned very much, and not without reason, on\nthis last expedient, as a means of engaging the attention of the bulk of\nthe insurgents, while he himself, and two or three of their leaders, held\na private council of war, undisturbed by the discordant opinions, or\nsenseless clamour, of the general body.Kettledrummle more than answered the expectations of Burley.Two mortal\nhours did he preach at a breathing; and certainly no lungs, or doctrine,\nexcepting his own, could have kept up, for so long a time, the attention\nof men in such precarious circumstances.But he possessed in perfection a\nsort of rude and familiar eloquence peculiar to the preachers of that\nperiod, which, though it would have been fastidiously rejected by an\naudience which possessed any portion of taste, was a cake of the right\nleaven for the palates of those whom he now addressed.His text was from\nthe forty-ninth chapter of Isaiah, "Even the captives of the mighty shall\nbe taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I\nwill contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy\nchildren."And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they\nshall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh\nshall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty\nOne of Jacob."The discourse which he pronounced upon this subject was divided into\nfifteen heads, each of which was garnished with seven uses of\napplication, two of consolation, two of terror, two declaring the causes\nof backsliding and of wrath, and one announcing the promised and expected\ndeliverance.The first part of his text he applied to his own deliverance\nand that of his companions; and took occasion to speak a few words in\npraise of young Milnwood, of whom, as of a champion of the Covenant, he\naugured great things.The second part he applied to the punishments which\nwere about to fall upon the persecuting government.At times he\nwas familiar and colloquial; now he was loud, energetic, and\nboisterous;--some parts of his discourse might be called sublime, and\nothers sunk below burlesque.Occasionally he vindicated with great\nanimation the right of every freeman to worship God according to his own\nconscience; and presently he charged the guilt and misery of the people\non the awful negligence of their rulers, who had not only failed to\nestablish presbytery as the national religion, but had tolerated\nsectaries of various descriptions, <DW7>s, Prelatists, Erastians,\nassuming the name of Presbyterians, Independents, Socinians, and\nQuakers: all of whom Kettledrummle proposed, by one sweeping act, to\nexpel from the land, and thus re-edify in its integrity the beauty of\nthe sanctuary.He next handled very pithily the doctrine of defensive\narms and of resistance to Charles II., observing, that, instead of a\nnursing father to the Kirk, that monarch had been a nursing father to\nnone but his own bastards.He went at some length through the life and\nconversation of that joyous prince, few parts of which, it must be\nowned, were qualified to stand the rough handling of so uncourtly an\norator, who conferred on him the hard names of Jeroboam, Omri, Ahab,\nShallum, Pekah, and every other evil monarch recorded in the Chronicles,\nand concluded with a round application of the Scripture, "Tophet is\nordained of old; yea, for the King it is provided: he hath made it deep\nand large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the\nLord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it."Kettledrummle had no sooner ended his sermon, and descended from the huge\nrock which had served him for a pulpit, than his post was occupied by a\npastor of a very different description.The reverend Gabriel was advanced\nin years, somewhat corpulent, with a loud voice, a square face, and a set\nof stupid and unanimated features, in which the body seemed more to\npredominate over the spirit than was seemly in a sound divine.The youth\nwho succeeded him in exhorting this extraordinary convocation, Ephraim\nMacbriar by name, was hardly twenty years old; yet his thin features\nalready indicated, that a constitution, naturally hectic, was worn out by\nvigils, by fasts, by the rigour of imprisonment, and the fatigues\nincident to a fugitive life.Young as he was, he had been twice\nimprisoned for several months, and suffered many severities, which gave\nhim great influence with those of his own sect.He threw his faded eyes\nover the multitude and over the scene of battle; and a light of triumph\narose in his glance, his pale yet striking features were  with a\ntransient and hectic blush of joy.He folded his hands, raised his face\nto heaven, and seemed lost in mental prayer and thanksgiving ere he\naddressed the people.When he spoke, his faint and broken voice seemed at\nfirst inadequate to express his conceptions.But the deep silence of the\nassembly, the eagerness with which the ear gathered every word, as the\nfamished Israelites collected the heavenly manna, had a corresponding\neffect upon the preacher himself.His words became more distinct, his\nmanner more earnest and energetic; it seemed as if religious zeal was\ntriumphing over bodily weakness and infirmity.His natural eloquence was\nnot altogether untainted with the coarseness of his sect; and yet, by the\ninfluence of a good natural taste, it was freed from the grosser and more\nludicrous errors of his contemporaries; and the language of Scripture,\nwhich, in their mouths, was sometimes degraded by misapplication, gave,\nin Macbriar\'s exhortation, a rich and solemn effect, like that which is\nproduced by the beams of the sun streaming through the storied\nrepresentation of saints and martyrs on the Gothic window of some ancient\ncathedral.He painted the desolation of the church, during the late period of her\ndistresses, in the most affecting colours.He described her, like Hagar\nwatching the waning life of her infant amid the fountainless desert; like\nJudah, under her palm-tree, mourning for the devastation of her temple;\nlike Rachel, weeping for her children and refusing comfort.But he\nchiefly rose into rough sublimity when addressing the men yet reeking\nfrom battle.He called on them to remember the great things which God had\ndone for them, and to persevere in the career which their victory had\nopened."Your garments are dyed--but not with the juice of the wine-press; your\nswords are filled with blood," he exclaimed, "but not with the blood of\ngoats or lambs; the dust of the desert on which ye stand is made fat with\ngore, but not with the blood of bullocks, for the Lord hath a sacrifice\nin Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.These were not\nthe firstlings of the flock, the small cattle of burnt-offerings, whose\nbodies lie like dung on the ploughed field of the husbandman; this is not\nthe savour of myrrh, of frankincense, or of sweet herbs, that is steaming\nin your nostrils; but these bloody trunks are the carcasses of those who\nheld the bow and the lance, who were cruel and would show no mercy, whose\nvoice roared like the sea, who rode upon horses, every man in array as if\nto battle--they are the carcasses even of the mighty men of war that came\nagainst Jacob in the day of his deliverance, and the smoke is that of the\ndevouring fires that have consumed them.And those wild hills that\nsurround you are not a sanctuary planked with cedar and plated with\nsilver; nor are ye ministering priests at the altar, with censers and\nwith torches; but ye hold in your hands the sword, and the bow, and the\nweapons of death.And yet verily, I say unto you, that not when the\nancient Temple was in its first glory was there offered sacrifice more\nacceptable than that which you have this day presented, giving to the\nslaughter the tyrant and the oppressor, with the rocks for your altars,\nand the sky for your vaulted sanctuary, and your own good swords for the\ninstruments of sacrifice.Leave not, therefore, the plough in the\nfurrow--turn not back from the path in which you have entered like the\nfamous worthies of old, whom God raised up for the glorifying of his\nname and the deliverance of his afflicted people--halt not in the race\nyou are running, lest the latter end should be worse than the beginning.Wherefore, set up a standard in the land; blow a trumpet upon the\nmountains; let not the shepherd tarry by his sheepfold, or the seedsman\ncontinue in the ploughed field; but make the watch strong, sharpen the\narrows, burnish the shields, name ye the captains of thousands, and\ncaptains of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens; call the footmen like the\nrushing of winds, and cause the horsemen to come up like the sound of\nmany waters; for the passages of the destroyers are stopped, their rods\nare burned, and the face of their men of battle hath been turned to\nflight.Heaven has been with you, and has broken the bow of the mighty;\nthen let every man\'s heart be as the heart of the valiant Maccabeus,\nevery man\'s hand as the hand of the mighty Sampson, every man\'s sword as\nthat of Gideon, which turned not back from the slaughter; for the banner\nof Reformation is spread abroad on the mountains in its first\nloveliness, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."Well is he this day that shall barter his house for a helmet, and sell\nhis garment for a sword, and cast in his lot with the children of the\nCovenant, even to the fulfilling of the promise; and woe, woe unto him\nwho, for carnal ends and self-seeking, shall withhold himself from the\ngreat work, for the curse shall abide with him, even the bitter curse of\nMeroz, because he came not to the help of the Lord against the mighty.Up, then, and be doing; the blood of martyrs, reeking upon scaffolds, is\ncrying for vengeance; the bones of saints, which lie whitening in the\nhighways, are pleading for retribution; the groans of innocent captives\nfrom desolate isles of the sea, and from the dungeons of the tyrants\'\nhigh places, cry for deliverance; the prayers of persecuted Christians,\nsheltering themselves in dens and deserts from the sword of their\npersecutors, famished with hunger, starving with cold, lacking fire,\nfood, shelter, and clothing, because they serve God rather than man--all\nare with you, pleading, watching, knocking, storming the gates of heaven\nin your behalf.Heaven itself shall fight for you, as the stars in their\ncourses fought against Sisera.Then whoso will deserve immortal fame in\nthis world, and eternal happiness in that which is to come, let them\nenter into God\'s service, and take arles at the hand of his servant,--a\nblessing, namely, upon him and his household, and his children, to the\nninth generation, even the blessing of the promise, for ever and ever!The eloquence of the preacher was rewarded by the deep hum of stern\napprobation which resounded through the armed assemblage at the\nconclusion of an exhortation, so well suited to that which they had done,\nand that which remained for them to do.The wounded forgot their pain,\nthe faint and hungry their fatigues and privations, as they listened to\ndoctrines which elevated them alike above the wants and calamities of the\nworld, and identified their cause with that of the Deity.Many crowded\naround the preacher, as he descended from the eminence on which he stood,\nand, clasping him with hands on which the gore was not yet hardened,\npledged their sacred vow that they would play the part of Heaven\'s true\nsoldiers.Exhausted by his own enthusiasm, and by the animated fervour\nwhich he had exerted in his discourse, the preacher could only reply, in\nbroken accents,--"God bless you, my brethren--it is his cause.--Stand\nstrongly up and play the men--the worst that can befall us is but a brief\nand bloody passage to heaven."Balfour, and the other leaders, had not lost the time which was employed\nin these spiritual exercises.Watch-fires were lighted, sentinels were\nposted, and arrangements were made to refresh the army with such\nprovisions as had been hastily collected from the nearest farm-houses and\nvillages.The present necessity thus provided for, they turned their\nthoughts to the future.They had dispatched parties to spread the news of\ntheir victory, and to obtain, either by force or favour, supplies of what\nthey stood most in need of.In this they had succeeded beyond their\nhopes, having at one village seized a small magazine of provisions,\nforage, and ammunition, which had been provided for the royal forces.This success not only gave them relief at the time, but such hopes for\nthe future, that whereas formerly some of their number had begun to\nslacken in their zeal, they now unanimously resolved to abide together in\narms, and commit themselves and their cause to the event of war.And whatever may be thought of the extravagance or narrow-minded bigotry\nof many of their tenets, it is impossible to deny the praise of devoted\ncourage to a few hundred peasants, who, without leaders, without money,\nwithout magazines, without any fixed plan of action, and almost without\narms, borne out only by their innate zeal, and a detestation of the\noppression of their rulers, ventured to declare open war against an\nestablished government, supported by a regular army and the whole force\nof three kingdoms.Why, then, say an old man can do somewhat.We must now return to the tower of Tillietudlem, which the march of the\nLife-Guards, on the morning of this eventful day, had left to silence and\nanxiety.The assurances of Lord Evandale had not succeeded in quelling\nthe apprehensions of Edith.She knew him generous, and faithful to his\nword; but it seemed too plain that he suspected the object of her\nintercession to be a successful rival; and was it not expecting from him\nan effort above human nature, to suppose that he was to watch over\nMorton\'s safety, and rescue him from all the dangers to which his state\nof imprisonment, and the suspicions which he had incurred, must\nrepeatedly expose him?She therefore resigned herself to the most\nheart-rending apprehensions, without admitting, and indeed almost without\nlistening to, the multifarious grounds of consolation which Jenny\nDennison brought forward, one after another, like a skilful general who\ncharges with the several divisions of his troops in regular succession.First, Jenny was morally positive that young Milnwood would come to no\nharm--then, if he did, there was consolation in the reflection, that Lord\nEvandale was the better and more appropriate match of the two--then,\nthere was every chance of a battle, in which the said Lord Evandale might\nbe killed, and there wad be nae mair fash about that job--then, if the\nwhigs gat the better, Milnwood and Cuddie might come to the Castle, and\ncarry off the beloved of their hearts by the strong hand."For I forgot to tell ye, madam," continued the damsel, putting her\nhandkerchief to her eyes, "that puir Cuddie\'s in the hands of the\nPhilistines as weel as young Milnwood, and he was brought here a prisoner\nthis morning, and I was fain to speak Tam Halliday fair, and fleech him\nto let me near the puir creature; but Cuddie wasna sae thankfu\' as he\nneeded till hae been neither," she added, and at the same time changed\nher tone, and briskly withdrew the handkerchief from her face; "so I will\nne\'er waste my een wi\' greeting about the matter.There wad be aye enow\no\' young men left, if they were to hang the tae half o\' them."The other inhabitants of the Castle were also in a state of\ndissatisfaction and anxiety.Lady Margaret thought that Colonel Grahame,\nin commanding an execution at the door of her house, and refusing to\ngrant a reprieve at her request, had fallen short of the deference due to\nher rank, and had even encroached on her seignorial rights."The Colonel," she said, "ought to have remembered, brother, that the\nbarony of Tillietudlem has the baronial privilege of pit and gallows; and\ntherefore, if the lad was to be executed on my estate, (which I consider\nas an unhandsome thing, seeing it is in the possession of females, to\nwhom such tragedies cannot be acceptable,) he ought, at common law, to\nhave been delivered up to my bailie, and justified at his sight.""Martial law, sister," answered Major Bellenden, "supersedes every other.But I must own I think Colonel Grahame rather deficient in attention to\nyou; and I am not over and above pre-eminently flattered by his granting\nto young Evandale (I suppose because he is a lord, and has interest with\nthe privy-council) a request which he refused to so old a servant of the\nking as I am.But so long as the poor young fellow\'s life is saved, I can\ncomfort myself with the fag-end of a ditty as old as myself."And\ntherewithal, he hummed a stanza:\n\n\'And what though winter will pinch severe Through locks of grey and a\ncloak that\'s old?Yet keep up thy heart, bold cavalier, For a cup of sack\nshall fence the cold.\'"I must be your guest here to-day, sister.I wish to hear the issue of\nthis gathering on Loudon-hill, though I cannot conceive their standing a\nbody of horse appointed like our guests this morning.--Woe\'s me, the time\nhas been that I would have liked ill to have sate in biggit wa\'s waiting\nfor the news of a skirmish to be fought within ten miles of me!But, as\nthe old song goes,\n\n               \'For time will rust the brightest blade,\n               And years will break the strongest bow;\n               Was ever wight so starkly made,\n               But time and years would overthrow?\'""We are well pleased you will stay, brother," said Lady Margaret; "I will\ntake my old privilege to look after my household, whom this collation has\nthrown into some disorder, although it is uncivil to leave you alone.""O, I hate ceremony as I hate a stumbling horse," replied the Major."Besides, your person would be with me, and your mind with the cold meat\nand reversionary pasties.--Where is Edith?""Gone to her room a little evil-disposed, I am informed, and laid down in\nher bed for a gliff," said her grandmother; "as soon as she wakes, she\nshall take some drops."she\'s only sick of the soldiers," answered Major Bellenden."She\'s not accustomed to see one acquaintance led out to be shot, and\nanother marching off to actual service, with some chance of not finding\nhis way back again.She would soon be used to it, if the civil war were\nto break out again.""Ay, Heaven forbid, as you say--and, in the meantime, I\'ll take a hit at\ntrick-track with Harrison.""He has ridden out, sir," said Gudyill, "to try if he can hear any\ntidings of the battle.""D--n the battle," said the Major; "it puts this family as much out of\norder as if there had never been such a thing in the country before--and\nyet there was such a place as Kilsythe, John.""Ay, and as Tippermuir, your honour," replied Gudyill, "where I was his\nhonour my late master\'s rear-rank man.""And Alford, John," pursued the Major, "where I commanded the horse; and\nInnerlochy, where I was the Great Marquis\'s aid-de-camp; and Auld Earn,\nand Brig o\' Dee.""And Philiphaugh, your honour," said John.replied the Major; "the less, John, we say about that matter, the\nbetter."However, being once fairly embarked on the subject of Montrose\'s\ncampaigns, the Major and John Gudyill carried on the war so stoutly, as\nfor a considerable time to keep at bay the formidable enemy called Time,\nwith whom retired veterans, during the quiet close of a bustling life,\nusually wage an unceasing hostility.It has been frequently remarked, that the tidings of important events fly\nwith a celerity almost beyond the power of credibility, and that reports,\ncorrect in the general point, though inaccurate in details, precede the\ncertain intelligence, as if carried by the birds of the air.Such rumours\nanticipate the reality, not unlike to the "shadows of coming events,"\nwhich occupy the imagination of the Highland Seer.Harrison, in his ride,\nencountered some such report concerning the event of the battle, and\nturned his horse back to Tillietudlem in great dismay.He made it his\nfirst business to seek out the Major, and interrupted him in the midst of\na prolix account of the siege and storm of Dundee, with the ejaculation,\n"Heaven send, Major, that we do not see a siege of Tillietudlem before we\nare many days older!""How is that, Harrison?--what the devil do you mean?""Troth, sir, there is strong and increasing belief that Claver\'se is\nclean broken, some say killed; that the soldiers are all dispersed, and\nthat the rebels are hastening this way, threatening death and devastation\nto a\' that will not take the Covenant.""I will never believe that," said the Major, starting on his feet--"I\nwill never believe that the Life-Guards would retreat before rebels;--and\nyet why need I say that," he continued, checking himself, "when I have\nseen such sights myself?--Send out Pike, and one or two of the servants,\nfor intelligence, and let all the men in the Castle and in the village\nthat can be trusted take up arms.This old tower may hold them play a\nbit, if it were but victualled and garrisoned, and it commands the pass\nbetween the high and low countries.--It\'s lucky I chanced to be\nhere.--Go, muster men, Harrison.--You, Gudyill, look what provisions you\nhave, or can get brought in, and be ready, if the news be confirmed, to\nknock down as many bullocks as you have salt for.--The well never goes\ndry.--There are some old-fashioned guns on the battlements; if we had\nbut ammunition, we should do well enough.""The soldiers left some casks of ammunition at the Grange this morning,\nto bide their return," said Harrison."Hasten, then," said the Major, "and bring it into the Castle, with every\npike, sword, pistol, or gun, that is within our reach; don\'t leave so\nmuch as a bodkin--Lucky that I was here!--I will speak to my sister\ninstantly."Lady Margaret Bellenden was astounded at intelligence so unexpected and\nso alarming.It had seemed to her that the imposing force which had that\nmorning left her walls, was sufficient to have routed all the disaffected\nin Scotland, if collected in a body; and now her first reflection was\nupon the inadequacy of their own means of resistance, to an army strong\nenough to have defeated Claverhouse and such select troops.said she; "what will all that we can do avail us, brother?--\nWhat will resistance do but bring sure destruction on the house, and on\nthe bairn Edith!for, God knows, I thinkna on my ain auld life.""Come, sister," said the Major, "you must not be cast down; the place is\nstrong, the rebels ignorant and ill-provided: my brother\'s house shall\nnot be made a den of thieves and rebels while old Miles Bellenden is in\nit.My hand is weaker than it was, but I thank my old grey hairs that I\nhave some knowledge of war yet.Here comes Pike with intelligence.--What\nnews, Pike?"Ay, ay," said Pike, composedly; "a total scattering.--I thought this\nmorning little gude would come of their newfangled gate of slinging their\ncarabines.""Whom did you see?--Who gave you the news?""O, mair than half-a-dozen dragoon fellows that are a\' on the spur whilk\nto get first to Hamilton.They\'ll win the race, I warrant them, win the\nbattle wha like.""Continue your preparations, Harrison," said the alert veteran; "get your\nammunition in, and the cattle killed.Send down to the borough-town for\nwhat meal you can gather.We must not lose an instant.--Had not Edith and\nyou, sister, better return to Charnwood, while we have the means of\nsending you there?""No, brother," said Lady Margaret, looking very pale, but speaking with\nthe greatest composure; "since the auld house is to be held out, I will\ntake my chance in it.I have fled twice from it in my days, and I have\naye found it desolate of its bravest and its bonniest when I returned;\nsae that I will e\'en abide now, and end my pilgrimage in it.""It may, on the whole, be the safest course both for Edith and you," said\nthe Major; "for the whigs will rise all the way between this and Glasgow,\nand make your travelling there, or your dwelling at Charnwood, very\nunsafe.""So be it then," said Lady Margaret; "and, dear brother, as the nearest\nblood-relation of my deceased husband, I deliver to you, by this\nsymbol,"--(here she gave into his hand the venerable goldheaded staff of\nthe deceased Earl of Torwood,)--"the keeping and government and\nseneschalship of my Tower of Tillietudlem, and the appurtenances thereof,\nwith full power to kill, slay, and damage those who shall assail the\nsame, as freely as I might do myself.And I trust you will so defend it,\nas becomes a house in which his most sacred majesty has not disdained"--\n\n"Pshaw!sister," interrupted the Major, "we have no time to speak about\nthe king and his breakfast just now."And, hastily leaving the room, he hurried, with all the alertness of a\nyoung man of twenty-five, to examine the state of his garrison, and\nsuperintend the measures which were necessary for defending the place.The Tower of Tillietudlem, having very thick walls, and very narrow\nwindows, having also a very strong court-yard wall, with flanking turrets\non the only accessible side, and rising on the other from the very verge\nof a precipice, was fully capable of defence against any thing but a\ntrain of heavy artillery.Famine or escalade was what the garrison had chiefly to fear.For\nartillery, the top of the Tower was mounted with some antiquated\nwall-pieces, and small cannons, which bore the old-fashioned names of\nculverins, sakers, demi-sakers, falcons, and falconets.These, the Major,\nwith the assistance of John Gudyill, caused to be scaled and loaded, and\npointed them so as to command the road over the brow of the opposite hill\nby which the rebels must advance, causing, at the same time, two or three\ntrees to be cut down, which would have impeded the effect of the\nartillery when it should be necessary to use it.With the trunks of these\ntrees, and other materials, he directed barricades to be constructed upon\nthe winding avenue which rose to the Tower along the high-road, taking\ncare that each should command the other.The large gate of the court-yard\nhe barricadoed yet more strongly, leaving only a wicket open for the\nconvenience of passage.What he had most to apprehend, was the\nslenderness of his garrison; for all the efforts of the steward were\nunable to get more than nine men under arms, himself and Gudyill\nincluded, so much more popular was the cause of the insurgents than that\nof the government Major Bellenden, and his trusty servant Pike, made the\ngarrison eleven in number, of whom one-half were old men.The round dozen\nmight indeed have been made up, would Lady Margaret have consented that\nGoose Gibbie should again take up arms.But she recoiled from the\nproposal, when moved by Gudyill, with such abhorrent recollection of the\nformer achievements of that luckless cavalier, that she declared she\nwould rather the Castle were lost than that he were to be enrolled in the\ndefence of it.With eleven men, however, himself included, Major\nBellenden determined to hold out the place to the uttermost.The arrangements for defence were not made without the degree of fracas\nincidental to such occasions.Women shrieked, cattle bellowed, dogs\nhowled, men ran to and fro, cursing and swearing without intermission,\nthe lumbering of the old guns backwards and forwards shook the\nbattlements, the court resounded with the hasty gallop of messengers who\nwent and returned upon errands of importance, and the din of warlike\npreparation was mingled with the sound of female laments.Such a Babel of discord might have awakened the slumbers of the very\ndead, and, therefore, was not long ere it dispelled the abstracted\nreveries of Edith Bellenden.She sent out Jenny to bring her the cause of\nthe tumult which shook the castle to its very basis; but Jenny, once\nengaged in the bustling tide, found so much to ask and to hear, that she\nforgot the state of anxious uncertainty in which she had left her young\nmistress.Having no pigeon to dismiss in pursuit of information when her\nraven messenger had failed to return with it, Edith was compelled to\nventure in quest of it out of the ark of her own chamber into the deluge\nof confusion which overflowed the rest of the Castle.Six voices speaking\nat once, informed her, in reply to her first enquiry, that Claver\'se and\nall his men were killed, and that ten thousand whigs were marching to\nbesiege the castle, headed by John Balfour of Burley, young Milnwood, and\nCuddie Headrigg.This strange association of persons seemed to infer the\nfalsehood of the whole story, and yet the general bustle in the Castle\nintimated that danger was certainly apprehended."In her oratory," was the reply: a cell adjoining to the chapel, in which\nthe good old lady was wont to spend the greater part of the days destined\nby the rules of the Episcopal Church to devotional observances, as also\nthe anniversaries of those on which she had lost her husband and her\nchildren, and, finally, those hours, in which a deeper and more solemn\naddress to Heaven was called for, by national or domestic calamity."Where, then," said Edith, much alarmed, "is Major Bellenden?""On the battlements of the Tower, madam, pointing the cannon," was the\nreply.To the battlements, therefore, she made her way, impeded by a thousand\nobstacles, and found the old gentleman in the midst of his natural\nmilitary element, commanding, rebuking, encouraging, instructing, and\nexercising all the numerous duties of a good governor."In the name of God, what is the matter, uncle?"answered the Major coolly, as, with spectacles on\nhis nose, he examined the position of a gun--"The matter?Why,--raise her\nbreech a thought more, John Gudyill--the matter?Why, Claver\'se is\nrouted, my dear, and the whigs are coming down upon us in force, that\'s\nall the matter."said Edith, whose eye at that instant caught a glance\nof the road which ran up the river, "and yonder they come!"said the veteran; and, his eyes taking the same\ndirection, he beheld a large body of horsemen coming down the path."Stand to your guns, my lads!"was the first exclamation; "we\'ll make\nthem pay toll as they pass the heugh.--But stay, stay, these are\ncertainly the Life-Guards.""O no, uncle, no," replied Edith; "see how disorderly they ride, and how\nill they keep their ranks; these cannot be the fine soldiers who left us\nthis morning."answered the Major, "you do not know the difference\nbetween men before a battle and after a defeat; but the Life-Guards it\nis, for I see the red and blue and the King\'s colours.I am glad they\nhave brought them off, however."His opinion was confirmed as the troopers approached nearer, and finally\nhalted on the road beneath the Tower; while their commanding officer,\nleaving them to breathe and refresh their horses, hastily rode up the\nhill."It is Claverhouse, sure enough," said the Major; "I am glad he has\nescaped, but he has lost his famous black horse.Let Lady Margaret know,\nJohn Gudyill; order some refreshments; get oats for the soldiers\' horses;\nand let us to the hall, Edith, to meet him.I surmise we shall hear but\nindifferent news."With careless gesture, mind unmoved,\n                    On rade he north the plain,\n                    His seem in thrang of fiercest strife,\n                    When winner aye the same.Colonel Grahame of Claverhouse met the family, assembled in the hall of\nthe Tower, with the same serenity and the same courtesy which had graced\nhis manners in the morning.He had even had the composure to rectify in\npart the derangement of his dress, to wash the signs of battle from his\nface and hands, and did not appear more disordered in his exterior than\nif returned from a morning ride."I am grieved, Colonel Grahame," said the reverend old lady, the tears\ntrickling down her face, "deeply grieved.""And I am grieved, my dear Lady Margaret," replied Claverhouse, "that\nthis misfortune may render your remaining at Tillietudlem dangerous for\nyou, especially considering your recent hospitality to the King\'s troops,\nand your well-known loyalty.And I came here chiefly to request Miss\nBellenden and you to accept my escort (if you will not scorn that of a\npoor runaway) to Glasgow, from whence I will see you safely sent either\nto Edinburgh or to Dunbarton Castle, as you shall think best.""I am much obliged to you, Colonel Grahame," replied Lady Margaret; "but\nmy brother, Major Bellenden, has taken on him the responsibility of\nholding out this house against the rebels; and, please God, they shall\nnever drive Margaret Bellenden from her ain hearth-stane while there\'s a\nbrave man that says he can defend it.""And will Major Bellenden undertake this?"said Claverhouse hastily, a\njoyful light glancing from his dark eye as he turned it on the\nveteran,--"Yet why should I question it?it is of a piece with the rest\nof his life.--But have you the means, Major?""All, but men and provisions, with which we are ill supplied," answered\nthe Major."As for men," said Claverhouse, "I will leave you a dozen or twenty\nfellows who will make good a breach against the devil.It will be of the\nutmost service, if you can defend the place but a week, and by that time\nyou must surely be relieved.""I will make it good for that space, Colonel," replied the Major, "with\ntwenty-five good men and store of ammunition, if we should gnaw the soles\nof our shoes for hunger; but I trust we shall get in provisions from the\ncountry.""And, Colonel Grahame, if I might presume a request," said Lady Margaret,\n"I would entreat that Sergeant Francis Stewart might command the\nauxiliaries whom you are so good as to add to the garrison of our people;\nit may serve to legitimate his promotion, and I have a prejudice in\nfavour of his noble birth.""The sergeant\'s wars are ended, madam," said Grahame, in an unaltered\ntone, "and he now needs no promotion that an earthly master can give.""Pardon me," said Major Bellenden, taking Claverhouse by the arm, and\nturning him away from the ladies, "but I am anxious for my friends; I\nfear you have other and more important loss.I observe another officer\ncarries your nephew\'s standard.""You are right, Major Bellenden," answered Claverhouse firmly; "my nephew\nis no more.He has died in his duty, as became him."exclaimed the Major, "how unhappy!--the handsome, gallant,\nhigh-spirited youth!""He was indeed all you say," answered Claverhouse; "poor Richard was to\nme as an eldest son, the apple of my eye, and my destined heir; but he\ndied in his duty, and I--I--Major Bellenden"--(he wrung the Major\'s hand\nhard as he spoke)--"I live to avenge him.""Colonel Grahame," said the affectionate veteran, his eyes filling with\ntears, "I am glad to see you bear this misfortune with such fortitude.""I am not a selfish man," replied Claverhouse, "though the world will\ntell you otherwise; I am not selfish either in my hopes or fears, my joys\nor sorrows.I have not been severe for myself, or grasping for myself, or\nambitious for myself.The service of my master and the good of the\ncountry are what I have tried to aim at.I may, perhaps, have driven\nseverity into cruelty, but I acted for the best; and now I will not yield\nto my own feelings a deeper sympathy than I have given to those of\nothers.""I am astonished at your fortitude under all the unpleasant circumstances\nof this affair," pursued the Major."Yes," replied Claverhouse, "my enemies in the council will lay this\nmisfortune to my charge--I despise their accusations.They will\ncalumniate me to my sovereign--I can repel their charge.The public enemy\nwill exult in my flight--I shall find a time to show them that they exult\ntoo early.This youth that has fallen stood betwixt a grasping kinsman\nand my inheritance, for you know that my marriage-bed is barren; yet,\npeace be with him!the country can better spare him than your friend Lord\nEvandale, who, after behaving very gallantly, has, I fear, also fallen.""I heard a report of this, but\nit was again contradicted; it was added, that the poor young nobleman\'s\nimpetuosity had occasioned the loss of this unhappy field.""Not so, Major," said Grahame; "let the living officers bear the blame,\nif there be any; and let the laurels flourish untarnished on the grave of\nthe fallen.I do not, however, speak of Lord Evandale\'s death as certain;\nbut killed, or prisoner, I fear he must be.Yet he was extricated from\nthe tumult the last time we spoke together.We were then on the point of\nleaving the field with a rear-guard of scarce twenty men; the rest of the\nregiment were almost dispersed.""They have rallied again soon," said the Major, looking from the window\non the dragoons, who were feeding their horses and refreshing themselves\nbeside the brook."Yes," answered Claverhouse, "my blackguards had little temptation either\nto desert, or to straggle farther than they were driven by their first\npanic.There is small friendship and scant courtesy between them and the\nboors of this country; every village they pass is likely to rise on them,\nand so the scoundrels are driven back to their colours by a wholesome\nterror of spits, pike-staves, hay-forks, and broomsticks.--But now let us\ntalk about your plans and wants, and the means of corresponding with you.To tell you the truth, I doubt being able to make a long stand at\nGlasgow, even when I have joined my Lord Ross; for this transient and\naccidental success of the fanatics will raise the devil through all the\nwestern counties."They then discussed Major Bellenden\'s means of defence, and settled a\nplan of correspondence, in case a general insurrection took place, as was\nto be expected.Claverhouse renewed his offer to escort the ladies to a\nplace of safety; but, all things considered, Major Bellenden thought they\nwould be in equal safety at Tillietudlem.The Colonel then took a polite leave of Lady Margaret and Miss Bellenden,\nassuring them, that, though he was reluctantly obliged to leave them for\nthe present in dangerous circumstances, yet his earliest means should be\nturned to the redemption of his character as a good knight and true, and\nthat they might speedily rely on hearing from or seeing him.Full of doubt and apprehension, Lady Margaret was little able to reply to\na speech so much in unison with her usual expressions and feelings, but\ncontented herself with bidding Claverhouse farewell, and thanking him for\nthe succours which he had promised to leave them.Edith longed to enquire\nthe fate of Henry Morton, but could find no pretext for doing so, and\ncould only hope that it had made a subject of some part of the long\nprivate communication which her uncle had held with Claverhouse.On this\nsubject, however, she was disappointed; for the old cavalier was so\ndeeply immersed in the duties of his own office, that he had scarce said\na single word to Claverhouse, excepting upon military matters, and most\nprobably would have been equally forgetful, had the fate of his own son,\ninstead of his friend\'s, lain in the balance.Claverhouse now descended the bank on which the castle is founded, in\norder to put his troops again in motion, and Major Bellenden accompanied\nhim to receive the detachment who were to be left in the tower."I shall leave Inglis with you," said Claverhouse, "for, as I am\nsituated, I cannot spare an officer of rank; it is all we can do, by our\njoint efforts, to keep the men together.But should any of our missing\nofficers make their appearance, I authorize you to detain them; for my\nfellows can with difficulty be subjected to any other authority."His troops being now drawn up, he picked out sixteen men by name, and\ncommitted them to the command of Corporal Inglis, whom he promoted to the\nrank of sergeant on the spot."And hark ye, gentlemen," was his concluding harangue, "I leave you to\ndefend the house of a lady, and under the command of her brother, Major\nBellenden, a faithful servant to the king.You are to behave bravely,\nsoberly, regularly, and obediently, and each of you shall be handsomely\nrewarded on my return to relieve the garrison.In case of mutiny,\ncowardice, neglect of duty, or the slightest excess in the family, the\nprovost-marshal and cord--you know I keep my word for good and evil."He touched his hat as he bade them farewell, and shook hands cordially\nwith Major Bellenden."Adieu," he said, "my stout-hearted old friend!Good luck be with you,\nand better times to us both."The horsemen whom he commanded had been once more reduced to tolerable\norder by the exertions of Major Allan; and, though shorn of their\nsplendour, and with their gilding all besmirched, made a much more\nregular and military appearance on leaving, for the second time, the\ntower of Tillietudlem, than when they returned to it after their rout.Major Bellenden, now left to his own resources sent out several videttes,\nboth to obtain supplies of provisions, and especially of meal, and to get\nknowledge of the motions of the enemy.All the news he could collect on\nthe second subject tended to prove that the insurgents meant to remain on\nthe field of battle for that night.But they, also, had abroad their\ndetachments and advanced guards to collect supplies, and great was the\ndoubt and distress of those who received contrary orders, in the name of\nthe King and in that of the Kirk; the one commanding them to send\nprovisions to victual the Castle of Tillietudlem, and the other enjoining\nthem to forward supplies to the camp of the godly professors of true\nreligion, now in arms for the cause of covenanted reformation, presently\npitched at Drumclog, nigh to Loudon-hill.Each summons closed with a\ndenunciation of fire and sword if it was neglected; for neither party\ncould confide so far in the loyalty or zeal of those whom they addressed,\nas to hope they would part with their property upon other terms.So that\nthe poor people knew not what hand to turn themselves to; and, to say\ntruth, there were some who turned themselves to more than one."Thir kittle times will drive the wisest o\' us daft," said Niel Blane,\nthe prudent host of the Howff; "but I\'se aye keep a calm sough.--Jenny,\nwhat meal is in the girnel?""Four bows o\' aitmeal, twa bows o\' bear, and twa bows o\' pease," was\nJenny\'s reply."Aweel, hinny," continued Niel Blane, sighing deeply, "let Bauldy drive\nthe pease and bear meal to the camp at Drumclog--he\'s a whig, and was the\nauld gudewife\'s pleughman--the mashlum bannocks will suit their muirland\nstamachs weel.He maun say it\'s the last unce o\' meal in the house, or,\nif he scruples to tell a lie, (as it\'s no likely he will when it\'s for\nthe gude o\' the house,) he may wait till Duncan Glen, the auld drucken\ntrooper, drives up the aitmeal to Tillietudlem, wi\' my dutifu\' service to\nmy Leddy and the Major, and I haena as muckle left as will mak my\nparritch; and if Duncan manage right, I\'ll gie him a tass o\' whisky shall\nmak the blue low come out at his mouth.""And what are we to eat oursells then, father," asked Jenny, "when we hae\nsent awa the haill meal in the ark and the girnel?""We maun gar wheat-flour serve us for a blink," said Niel, in a tone of\nresignation; "it\'s no that ill food, though far frae being sae hearty or\nkindly to a Scotchman\'s stamach as the curney aitmeal is; the Englishers\nlive amaist upon\'t; but, to be sure, the pock-puddings ken nae better."While the prudent and peaceful endeavoured, like Niel Blane, to make fair\nweather with both parties, those who had more public (or party) spirit\nbegan to take arms on all sides.The royalists in the country were not\nnumerous, but were respectable from their fortune and influence, being\nchiefly landed proprietors of ancient descent, who, with their brothers,\ncousins, and dependents to the ninth generation, as well as their\ndomestic servants, formed a sort of militia, capable of defending their\nown peel-houses against detached bodies of the insurgents, of resisting\ntheir demand of supplies, and intercepting those which were sent to the\npresbyterian camp by others.The news that the Tower of Tillietudlem was\nto be defended against the insurgents, afforded great courage and support\nto these feudal volunteers, who considered it as a stronghold to which\nthey might retreat, in case it should become impossible for them to\nmaintain the desultory war they were now about to wage.On the other hand, the towns, the villages, the farm-houses, the\nproperties of small heritors, sent forth numerous recruits to the\npresbyterian interest.These men had been the principal sufferers during\nthe oppression of the time.Their minds were fretted, soured, and driven\nto desperation, by the various exactions and cruelties to which they had\nbeen subjected; and, although by no means united among themselves, either\nconcerning the purpose of this formidable insurrection, or the means by\nwhich that purpose was to be obtained, most of them considered it as a\ndoor opened by Providence to obtain the liberty of conscience of which\nthey had been long deprived, and to shake themselves free of a tyranny,\ndirected both against body and soul.Numbers of these men, therefore,\ntook up arms; and, in the phrase of their time and party, prepared to\ncast in their lot with the victors of Loudon-hill.I do not like the man: He is a heathen,\n          And speaks the language of Canaan truly.You must await his calling, and the coming\n          Of the good spirit.We return to Henry Morton, whom we left on the field of battle.He was\neating, by one of the watch-fires, his portion of the provisions which\nhad been distributed to the army, and musing deeply on the path which he\nwas next to pursue, when Burley suddenly came up to him, accompanied by\nthe young minister, whose exhortation after the victory had produced such\na powerful effect."Henry Morton," said Balfour abruptly, "the council of the army of the\nCovenant, confiding that the son of Silas Morton can never prove a\nlukewarm Laodicean, or an indifferent Gallio, in this great day, have\nnominated you to be a captain of their host, with the right of a vote in\ntheir council, and all authority fitting for an officer who is to command\nChristian men.""Mr Balfour," replied Morton, without hesitation, "I feel this mark of\nconfidence, and it is not surprising that a natural sense of the injuries\nof my country, not to mention those I have sustained in my own person,\nshould make me sufficiently willing to draw my sword for liberty and\nfreedom of conscience.But I will own to you, that I must be better\nsatisfied concerning the principles on which you bottom your cause ere I\ncan agree to take a command amongst you.""And can you doubt of our principles," answered Burley, "since we have\nstated them to be the reformation both of church and state, the\nrebuilding of the decayed sanctuary, the gathering of the dispersed\nsaints, and the destruction of the man of sin?""I will own frankly, Mr Balfour," replied Morton, "much of this sort of\nlanguage, which, I observe, is so powerful with others, is entirely lost\non me.It is proper you should be aware of this before we commune further\ntogether."(The young clergyman here groaned deeply.)"I distress you,\nsir," said Morton; "but, perhaps, it is because you will not hear me out.I revere the Scriptures as deeply as you or any Christian can do.I look\ninto them with humble hope of extracting a rule of conduct and a law of\nsalvation.But I expect to find this by an examination of their general\ntenor, and of the spirit which they uniformly breathe, and not by\nwresting particular passages from their context, or by the application of\nScriptural phrases to circumstances and events with which they have often\nvery slender relation."The young divine seemed shocked and thunderstruck with this declaration,\nand was about to remonstrate.said Burley, "remember he is but as a babe in swaddling\nclothes.--Listen to me, Morton.I will speak to thee in the worldly\nlanguage of that carnal reason, which is, for the present, thy blind and\nimperfect guide.What is the object for which thou art content to draw\nthy sword?Is it not that the church and state should be reformed by the\nfree voice of a free parliament, with such laws as shall hereafter\nprevent the executive government from spilling the blood, torturing and\nimprisoning the persons, exhausting the estates, and trampling upon the\nconsciences of men, at their own wicked pleasure?""Most certainly," said Morton; "such I esteem legitimate causes of\nwarfare, and for such I will fight while I can wield a sword.""Nay, but," said Macbriar, "ye handle this matter too tenderly; nor will\nmy conscience permit me to fard or daub over the causes of divine wrath.""Peace, Ephraim Macbriar!""I will not peace," said the young man."Is it not the cause of my Master\nwho hath sent me?Is it not a profane and Erastian destroying of his\nauthority, usurpation of his power, denial of his name, to place either\nKing or Parliament in his place as the master and governor of his\nhousehold, the adulterous husband of his spouse?""You speak well," said Burley, dragging him aside, "but not wisely; your\nown ears have heard this night in council how this scattered remnant are\nbroken and divided, and would ye now make a veil of separation between\nthem?Would ye build a wall with unslaked mortar?--if a fox go up, it\nwill breach it.""I know," said the young clergyman, in reply, "that thou art faithful,\nhonest, and zealous, even unto slaying; but, believe me, this worldly\ncraft, this temporizing with sin and with infirmity, is in itself a\nfalling away; and I fear me Heaven will not honour us to do much more for\nHis glory, when we seek to carnal cunning and to a fleshly arm.The\nsanctified end must be wrought by sanctified means.""I tell thee," answered Balfour, "thy zeal is too rigid in this matter;\nwe cannot yet do without the help of the Laodiceans and the Erastians; we\nmust endure for a space the indulged in the midst of the council--the\nsons of Zeruiah are yet too strong for us.""I tell thee I like it not," said Macbriar; "God can work deliverance by\na few as well as by a multitude.The host of the faithful that was broken\nupon Pentland-hills, paid but the fitting penalty of acknowledging the\ncarnal interest of that tyrant and oppressor, Charles Stewart.""Well, then," said Balfour, "thou knowest the healing resolution that the\ncouncil have adopted,--to make a comprehending declaration, that may suit\nthe tender consciences of all who groan under the yoke of our present\noppressors.Return to the council if thou wilt, and get them to recall\nit, and send forth one upon narrower grounds.But abide not here to\nhinder my gaining over this youth, whom my soul travails for; his name\nalone will call forth hundreds to our banners.""Do as thou wilt, then," said Macbriar; "but I will not assist to mislead\nthe youth, nor bring him into jeopardy of life, unless upon such grounds\nas will ensure his eternal reward."The more artful Balfour then dismissed the impatient preacher, and\nreturned to his proselyte.That we may be enabled to dispense with detailing at length the arguments\nby which he urged Morton to join the insurgents, we shall take this\nopportunity to give a brief sketch of the person by whom they were used,\nand the motives which he had for interesting himself so deeply in the\nconversion of young Morton to his cause.John Balfour of Kinloch, or Burley, for he is designated both ways in the\nhistories and proclamations of that melancholy period, was a gentleman of\nsome fortune, and of good family, in the county of Fife, and had been a\nsoldier from his youth upwards.In the younger part of his life he had\nbeen wild and licentious, but had early laid aside open profligacy, and\nembraced the strictest tenets of Calvinism.Unfortunately, habits of\nexcess and intemperance were more easily rooted out of his dark,\nsaturnine, and enterprising spirit, than the vices of revenge and\nambition, which continued, notwithstanding his religious professions, to\nexercise no small sway over his mind.Daring in design, precipitate and\nviolent in execution, and going to the very extremity of the most rigid\nrecusancy, it was his ambition to place himself at the head of the\npresbyterian interest.To attain this eminence among the whigs, he had been active in attending\ntheir conventicles, and more than once had commanded them when they\nappeared in arms, and beaten off the forces sent to disperse them.At\nlength, the gratification of his own fierce enthusiasm, joined, as some\nsay, with motives of private revenge, placed him at the head of that\nparty who assassinated the Primate of Scotland, as the author of the\nsufferings of the presbyterians.The violent measures adopted by\ngovernment to revenge this deed, not on the perpetrators only, but on the\nwhole professors of the religion to which they belonged, together with\nlong previous sufferings, without any prospect of deliverance, except by\nforce of arms, occasioned the insurrection, which, as we have already\nseen, commenced by the defeat of Claverhouse in the bloody skirmish of\nLoudon-hill.But Burley, notwithstanding the share he had in the victory, was far from\nfinding himself at the summit which his ambition aimed at.This was\npartly owing to the various opinions entertained among the insurgents\nconcerning the murder of Archbishop Sharpe.The more violent among them\ndid, indeed, approve of this act as a deed of justice, executed upon a\npersecutor of God\'s church through the immediate inspiration of the\nDeity; but the greater part of the presbyterians disowned the deed as a\ncrime highly culpable, although they admitted, that the Archbishop\'s\npunishment had by no means exceeded his deserts.The insurgents differed\nin another main point, which has been already touched upon.The more warm\nand extravagant fanatics condemned, as guilty of a pusillanimous\nabandonment of the rights of the church, those preachers and\ncongregations who were contented, in any manner, to exercise their\nreligion through the permission of the ruling government.This, they\nsaid, was absolute Erastianism, or subjection of the church of God to the\nregulations of an earthly government, and therefore but one degree better\nthan prelacy or popery.--Again, the more moderate party were content to\nallow the king\'s title to the throne, and in secular affairs to\nacknowledge his authority, so long as it was exercised with due regard to\nthe liberties of the subject, and in conformity to the laws of the realm.But the tenets of the wilder sect, called, from their leader Richard\nCameron, by the name of Cameronians, went the length of disowning the\nreigning monarch, and every one of his successors, who should not\nacknowledge the Solemn League and Covenant.The seeds of disunion were,\ntherefore, thickly sown in this ill-fated party; and Balfour, however\nenthusiastic, and however much attached to the most violent of those\ntenets which we have noticed, saw nothing but ruin to the general cause,\nif they were insisted on during this crisis, when unity was of so much\nconsequence.Hence he disapproved, as we have seen, of the honest,\ndownright, and ardent zeal of Macbriar, and was extremely desirous to\nreceive the assistance of the moderate party of presbyterians in the\nimmediate overthrow of the government, with the hope of being hereafter\nable to dictate to them what should be substituted in its place.He was, on this account, particularly anxious to secure the accession of\nHenry Morton to the cause of the insurgents.The memory of his father was\ngenerally esteemed among the presbyterians; and as few persons of any\ndecent quality had joined the insurgents, this young man\'s family and\nprospects were such as almost ensured his being chosen a leader.Through\nMorton\'s means, as being the son of his ancient comrade, Burley conceived\nhe might exercise some influence over the more liberal part of the army,\nand ultimately, perhaps, ingratiate himself so far with them, as to be\nchosen commander-in-chief, which was the mark at which his ambition\naimed.He had, therefore, without waiting till any other person took up\nthe subject, exalted to the council the talents and disposition of\nMorton, and easily obtained his elevation to the painful rank of a leader\nin this disunited and undisciplined army.The arguments by which Balfour pressed Morton to accept of this dangerous\npromotion, as soon as he had gotten rid of his less wary and\nuncompromising companion, Macbriar, were sufficiently artful and urgent.He did not affect either to deny or to disguise that the sentiments which\nhe himself entertained concerning church government, went as far as those\nof the preacher who had just left them; but he argued, that when the\naffairs of the nation were at such a desperate crisis, minute difference\nof opinion should not prevent those who, in general, wished well to their\noppressed country, from drawing their swords in its behalf.Many of the\nsubjects of division, as, for example, that concerning the Indulgence\nitself, arose, he observed, out of circumstances which would cease to\nexist, provided their attempt to free the country should be successful,\nseeing that the presbytery, being in that case triumphant, would need to\nmake no such compromise with the government, and, consequently, with the\nabolition of the Indulgence all discussion of its legality would be at\nonce ended.He insisted much and strongly upon the necessity of taking\nadvantage of this favourable crisis, upon the certainty of their being\njoined by the force of the whole western shires, and upon the gross guilt\nwhich those would incur, who, seeing the distress of the country, and the\nincreasing tyranny with which it was governed, should, from fear or\nindifference, withhold their active aid from the good cause.Morton wanted not these arguments to induce him to join in any\ninsurrection, which might appear to have a feasible prospect of freedom\nto the country.He doubted, indeed, greatly, whether the present attempt\nwas likely to be supported by the strength sufficient to ensure success,\nor by the wisdom and liberality of spirit necessary to make a good use of\nthe advantages that might be gained.Upon the whole, however, considering\nthe wrongs he had personally endured, and those which he had seen daily\ninflicted on his fellow-subjects; meditating also upon the precarious and\ndangerous situation in which he already stood with relation to the\ngovernment, he conceived himself, in every point of view, called upon to\njoin the body of presbyterians already in arms.But while he expressed to Burley his acquiescence in the vote which had\nnamed him a leader among the insurgents, and a member of their council of\nwar, it was not without a qualification."I am willing," he said, "to contribute every thing within my limited\npower to effect the emancipation of my country.I\ndisapprove, in the utmost degree, of the action in which this rising\nseems to have originated; and no arguments should induce me to join it,\nif it is to be carried on by such measures as that with which it has\ncommenced."Burley\'s blood rushed to his face, giving a ruddy and dark glow to his\nswarthy brow."You mean," he said, in a voice which he designed should not betray any\nemotion--"You mean the death of James Sharpe?""Frankly," answered Morton, "such is my meaning.""You imagine, then," said Burley, "that the Almighty, in times of\ndifficulty, does not raise up instruments to deliver his church from her\noppressors?You are of opinion that the justice of an execution consists,\nnot in the extent of the sufferer\'s crime, or in his having merited\npunishment, or in the wholesome and salutary effect which that example is\nlikely to produce upon other evil-doers, but hold that it rests solely in\nthe robe of the judge, the height of the bench, and the voice of the\ndoomster?Is not just punishment justly inflicted, whether on the\nscaffold or the moor?And where constituted judges, from cowardice, or\nfrom having cast in their lot with transgressors, suffer them not only to\npass at liberty through the land, but to sit in the high places, and dye\ntheir garments in the blood of the saints, is it not well done in any\nbrave spirits who shall draw their private swords in the public cause?""I have no wish to judge this individual action," replied Morton,\n"further than is necessary to make you fully aware of my principles.I\ntherefore repeat, that the case you have supposed does not satisfy my\njudgment.That the Almighty, in his mysterious providence, may bring a\nbloody man to an end deservedly bloody, does not vindicate those who,\nwithout authority of any kind, take upon themselves to be the instruments\nof execution, and presume to call them the executors of divine\nvengeance."said Burley, in a tone of fierce enthusiasm."Were\nnot we--was not every one who owned the interest of the Covenanted Church\nof Scotland, bound by that covenant to cut off the Judas who had sold the\ncause of God for fifty thousand merks a-year?Had we met him by the way\nas he came down from London, and there smitten him with the edge of the\nsword, we had done but the duty of men faithful to our cause, and to our\noaths recorded in heaven.Was not the execution itself a proof of our\nwarrant?Did not the Lord deliver him into our hands, when we looked out\nbut for one of his inferior tools of persecution?Did we not pray to be\nresolved how we should act, and was it not borne in on our hearts as if\nit had been written on them with the point of a diamond, \'Ye shall surely\ntake him and slay him?\'--Was not the tragedy full half an hour in acting\nere the sacrifice was completed, and that in an open heath, and within\nthe patrols of their garrisons--and yet who interrupted the great work?--\nWhat dog so much as bayed us during the pursuit, the taking, the slaying,\nand the dispersing?Then, who will say--who dare say, that a mightier arm\nthan ours was not herein revealed?""You deceive yourself, Mr Balfour," said Morton; "such circumstances of\nfacility of execution and escape have often attended the commission of\nthe most enormous crimes.--But it is not mine to judge you.I have not\nforgotten that the way was opened to the former liberation of Scotland by\nan act of violence which no man can justify,--the slaughter of Cumming by\nthe hand of Robert Bruce; and, therefore, condemning this action, as I do\nand must, I am not unwilling to suppose that you may have motives\nvindicating it in your own eyes, though not in mine, or in those of sober\nreason.I only now mention it, because I desire you to understand, that I\njoin a cause supported by men engaged in open war, which it is proposed\nto carry on according to the rules of civilized nations, without, in any\nrespect, approving of the act of violence which gave immediate rise to\nit."Balfour bit his lip, and with difficulty suppressed a violent answer.He\nperceived, with disappointment, that, upon points of principle, his young\nbrother-in-arms possessed a clearness of judgment, and a firmness of\nmind, which afforded but little hope of his being able to exert that\ndegree of influence over him which he had expected to possess.After a\nmoment\'s pause, however, he said, with coolness, "My conduct is open to\nmen and angels.The deed was not done in a corner; I am here in arms to\navow it, and care not where, or by whom, I am called on to do so; whether\nin the council, the field of battle, the place of execution, or the day\nof the last great trial.I will not now discuss it further with one who\nis yet on the other side of the veil.But if you will cast in your lot\nwith us as a brother, come with me to the council, who are still sitting,\nto arrange the future march of the army, and the means of improving our\nvictory."Morton arose and followed him in silence; not greatly delighted with his\nassociate, and better satisfied with the general justice of the cause\nwhich he had espoused, than either with the measures or the motives of\nmany of those who were embarked in it.[Illustration: Abbotsford--295]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD MORTALITY\n\nBy Walter Scott\n\n\n[Illustration: Titlepage]\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.[Illustration: Bookcover]\n\n\n[Illustration: Spines]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n               And look how many Grecian tents do stand\n               Hollow upon this plain--so many hollow factions.In a hollow of the hill, about a quarter of a mile from the field of\nbattle, was a shepherd\'s hut; a miserable cottage, which, as the only\nenclosed spot within a moderate distance, the leaders of the presbyterian\narmy had chosen for their council-house.Towards this spot Burley guided\nMorton, who was surprised, as he approached it, at the multifarious\nconfusion of sounds which issued from its precincts.The calm and anxious\ngravity which it might be supposed would have presided in councils held\non such important subjects, and at a period so critical, seemed to have\ngiven place to discord wild, and loud uproar, which fell on the ear of\ntheir new ally as an evil augury of their future measures.As they\napproached the door, they found it open indeed, but choked up with the\nbodies and heads of countrymen, who, though no members of the council,\nfelt no scruple in intruding themselves upon deliberations in which they\nwere so deeply interested.By expostulation, by threats, and even by some\ndegree of violence, Burley, the sternness of whose character maintained a\nsort of superiority over these disorderly forces, compelled the intruders\nto retire, and, introducing Morton into the cottage, secured the door\nbehind them against impertinent curiosity.At a less agitating moment,\nthe young man might have been entertained with the singular scene of\nwhich he now found himself an auditor and a spectator.The precincts of the gloomy and ruinous hut were enlightened partly by\nsome furze which blazed on the hearth, the smoke whereof, having no legal\nvent, eddied around, and formed over the heads of the assembled council a\nclouded canopy, as opake as their metaphysical theology, through which,\nlike stars through mist, were dimly seen to twinkle a few blinking\ncandles, or rather rushes dipped in tallow, the property of the poor\nowner of the cottage, which were stuck to the walls by patches of wet\nclay.This broken and dusky light showed many a countenance elated with\nspiritual pride, or rendered dark by fierce enthusiasm; and some whose\nanxious, wandering, and uncertain looks, showed they felt themselves\nrashly embarked in a cause which they had neither courage nor conduct to\nbring to a good issue, yet knew not how to abandon, for very shame.They\nwere, indeed, a doubtful and disunited body.The most active of their\nnumber were those concerned with Burley in the death of the Primate, four\nor five of whom had found their way to Loudon-hill, together with other\nmen of the same relentless and uncompromising zeal, who had, in various\nways, given desperate and unpardonable offence to the government.With them were mingled their preachers, men who had spurned at the\nindulgence offered by government, and preferred assembling their flocks\nin the wilderness, to worshipping in temples built by human hands, if\ntheir doing the latter should be construed to admit any right on the part\nof their rulers to interfere with the supremacy of the Kirk.The other\nclass of counsellors were such gentlemen of small fortune, and\nsubstantial farmers, as a sense of intolerable oppression had induced to\ntake arms and join the insurgents.These also had their clergymen with\nthem, and such divines, having many of them taken advantage of the\nindulgence, were prepared to resist the measures of their more violent\nbrethren, who proposed a declaration in which they should give testimony\nagainst the warrants and instructions for indulgence as sinful and\nunlawful acts.This delicate question had been passed over in silence in\nthe first draught of the manifestos which they intended to publish, of\nthe reasons of their gathering in arms; but it had been stirred anew\nduring Balfour\'s absence, and, to his great vexation, he now found that\nboth parties had opened upon it in full cry, Macbriar, Kettledrummle, and\nother teachers of the wanderers, being at the very spring-tide of\npolemical discussion with Peter Poundtext, the indulged pastor of\nMilnwood\'s parish, who, it seems, had e\'en girded himself with a\nbroadsword, but, ere he was called upon to fight for the good cause of\npresbytery in the field, was manfully defending his own dogmata in the\ncouncil.It was the din of this conflict, maintained chiefly between\nPoundtext and Kettledrummle, together with the clamour of their\nadherents, which had saluted Morton\'s ears upon approaching the cottage.Indeed, as both the divines were men well gifted with words and lungs,\nand each fierce, ardent, and intolerant in defence of his own doctrine,\nprompt in the recollection of texts wherewith they battered each other\nwithout mercy, and deeply impressed with the importance of the subject of\ndiscussion, the noise of the debate betwixt them fell little short of\nthat which might have attended an actual bodily conflict.Burley, scandalized at the disunion implied in this virulent strife of\ntongues, interposed between the disputants, and, by some general remarks\non the unseasonableness of discord, a soothing address to the vanity of\neach party, and the exertion of the authority which his services in that\nday\'s victory entitled him to assume, at length succeeded in prevailing\nupon them to adjourn farther discussion of the controversy.But although\nKettledrummle and Poundtext were thus for the time silenced, they\ncontinued to eye each other like two dogs, who, having been separated by\nthe authority of their masters while fighting, have retreated, each\nbeneath the chair of his owner, still watching each other\'s motions, and\nindicating, by occasional growls, by the erected bristles of the back and\nears, and by the red glance of the eye, that their discord is unappeased,\nand that they only wait the first opportunity afforded by any general\nmovement or commotion in the company, to fly once more at each other\'s\nthroats.Balfour took advantage of the momentary pause to present to the council\nMr Henry Morton of Milnwood, as one touched with a sense of the evils of\nthe times, and willing to peril goods and life in the precious cause for\nwhich his father, the renowned Silas Morton, had given in his time a\nsoul-stirring testimony.Morton was instantly received with the right\nhand of fellowship by his ancient pastor, Poundtext, and by those among\nthe insurgents who supported the more moderate principles.The others\nmuttered something about Erastianism, and reminded each other in\nwhispers, that Silas Morton, once a stout and worthy servant of the\nCovenant, had been a backslider in the day when the resolutioners had led\nthe way in owning the authority of Charles Stewart, thereby making a gap\nwhereat the present tyrant was afterwards brought in, to the oppression\nboth of Kirk and country.They added, however, that, on this great day of\ncalling, they would not refuse society with any who should put hand to\nthe plough; and so Morton was installed in his office of leader and\ncounsellor, if not with the full approbation of his colleagues, at least\nwithout any formal or avowed dissent.They proceeded, on Burley\'s motion,\nto divide among themselves the command of the men who had assembled, and\nwhose numbers were daily increasing.In this partition, the insurgents of\nPoundtext\'s parish and congregation were naturally placed under the\ncommand of Morton; an arrangement mutually agreeable to both parties, as\nhe was recommended to their confidence, as well by his personal qualities\nas his having been born among them.When this task was accomplished, it became necessary to determine what\nuse was to be made of their victory.Morton\'s heart throbbed high when he\nheard the Tower of Tillietudlem named as one of the most important\npositions to be seized upon.It commanded, as we have often noticed, the\npass between the more wild and the more fertile country, and must\nfurnish, it was plausibly urged, a stronghold and place of rendezvous to\nthe cavaliers and malignants of the district, supposing the insurgents\nwere to march onward and leave it uninvested.This measure was\nparticularly urged as necessary by Poundtext and those of his immediate\nfollowers, whose habitations and families might be exposed to great\nseverities, if this strong place were permitted to remain in possession\nof the royalists."I opine," said Poundtext,--for, like the other divines of the period, he\nhad no hesitation in offering his advice upon military matters of which\nhe was profoundly ignorant,--"I opine, that we should take in and raze\nthat stronghold of the woman Lady Margaret Bellenden, even though we\nshould build a fort and raise a mount against it; for the race is a\nrebellious and a bloody race, and their hand has been heavy on the\nchildren of the Covenant, both in the former and the latter times.Their\nhook hath been in our noses, and their bridle betwixt our jaws.""What are their means and men of defence?""The place is\nstrong; but I cannot conceive that two women can make it good against a\nhost.""There is also," said Poundtext, "Harrison the steward, and John Gudyill,\neven the lady\'s chief butler, who boasteth himself a man of war from his\nyouth upward, and who spread the banner against the good cause with that\nman of Belial, James Grahame of Montrose."returned Burley, scornfully, "a butler!""Also, there is that ancient malignant," replied Poundtext, "Miles\nBellenden of Charnwood, whose hands have been dipped in the blood of the\nsaints.""If that," said Burley, "be Miles Bellenden, the brother of Sir Arthur,\nhe is one whose sword will not turn back from battle; but he must now be\nstricken in years.""There was word in the country as I rode along," said another of the\ncouncil, "that so soon as they heard of the victory which has been given\nto us, they caused shut the gates of the tower, and called in men, and\ncollected ammunition.They were ever a fierce and a malignant house.""We will not, with my consent," said Burley, "engage in a siege which may\nconsume time.We must rush forward, and follow our advantage by occupying\nGlasgow; for I do not fear that the troops we have this day beaten, even\nwith the assistance of my Lord Ross\'s regiment, will judge it safe to\nawait our coming.""Howbeit," said Poundtext, "we may display a banner before the Tower, and\nblow a trumpet, and summon them to come forth.It may be that they will\ngive over the place into our mercy, though they be a rebellious people.And we will summon the women to come forth of their stronghold, that is,\nLady Margaret Bellenden and her grand-daughter, and Jenny Dennison, which\nis a girl of an ensnaring eye, and the other maids, and we will give them\na safe conduct, and send them in peace to the city, even to the town of\nEdinburgh.But John Gudyill, and Hugh Harrison, and Miles Bellenden, we\nwill restrain with fetters of iron, even as they, in times bypast, have\ndone to the martyred saints.""Who talks of safe conduct and of peace?"said a shrill, broken, and\noverstrained voice, from the crowd."Peace, brother Habakkuk," said Macbriar, in a soothing tone, to the\nspeaker."I will not hold my peace," reiterated the strange and unnatural voice;\n"is this a time to speak of peace, when the earth quakes, and the\nmountains are rent, and the rivers are changed into blood, and the\ntwo-edged sword is drawn from the sheath to drink gore as if it were\nwater, and devour flesh as the fire devours dry stubble?"While he spoke thus, the orator struggled forward to the inner part of\nthe circle, and presented to Morton\'s wondering eyes a figure worthy of\nsuch a voice and such language.The rags of a dress which had once been\nblack, added to the tattered fragments of a shepherd\'s plaid, composed a\ncovering scarce fit for the purposes of decency, much less for those of\nwarmth or comfort.A long beard, as white as snow, hung down on his\nbreast, and mingled with bushy, uncombed, grizzled hair, which hung in\nelf-locks around his wild and staring visage.The features seemed to be\nextenuated by penury and famine, until they hardly retained the likeness\nof a human aspect.The eyes, grey, wild, and wandering, evidently\nbetokened a bewildered imagination.He held in his hand a rusty sword,\nclotted with blood, as were his long lean hands, which were garnished at\nthe extremity with nails like eagle\'s claws.said Morton, in a whisper to\nPoundtext, surprised, shocked, and even startled, at this ghastly\napparition, which looked more like the resurrection of some cannibal\npriest, or druid red from his human sacrifice, than like an earthly\nmortal."It is Habakkuk Mucklewrath," answered Poundtext, in the same tone, "whom\nthe enemy have long detained in captivity in forts and castles, until his\nunderstanding hath departed from him, and, as I fear, an evil demon hath\npossessed him.Nevertheless, our violent brethren will have it, that he\nspeaketh of the spirit, and that they fructify by his pouring forth."Here he was interrupted by Mucklewrath, who cried in a voice that made\nthe very beams of the roof quiver--"Who talks of peace and safe conduct?who speaks of mercy to the bloody house of the malignants?I say take the\ninfants and dash them against the stones; take the daughters and the\nmothers of the house and hurl them from the battlements of their trust,\nthat the dogs may fatten on their blood as they did on that of Jezabel,\nthe spouse of Ahab, and that their carcasses may be dung to the face of\nthe field even in the portion of their fathers!""He speaks right," said more than one sullen voice from behind; "we will\nbe honoured with little service in the great cause, if we already make\nfair weather with Heaven\'s enemies.""This is utter abomination and daring impiety," said Morton, unable to\ncontain his indignation."What blessing can you expect in a cause, in which you listen to the\nmingled ravings of madness and atrocity?"said Kettledrummle, "and reserve thy censure for that\nfor which thou canst render a reason.It is not for thee to judge into\nwhat vessels the spirit may be poured.""We judge of the tree by the fruit," said Poundtext, "and allow not that\nto be of divine inspiration that contradicts the divine laws.""You forget, brother Poundtext," said Macbriar, "that these are the\nlatter days, when signs and wonders shall be multiplied."Poundtext stood forward to reply; but, ere he could articulate a word,\nthe insane preacher broke in with a scream that drowned all competition.Am not I Habakkuk Mucklewrath, whose\nname is changed to Magor-Missabib, because I am made a terror unto myself\nand unto all that are around me?--I heard it--When did I hear it?--Was it\nnot in the Tower of the Bass, that overhangeth the wide wild sea?--And it\nhowled in the winds, and it roared in the billows, and it screamed, and\nit whistled, and it clanged, with the screams and the clang and the\nwhistle of the sea-birds, as they floated, and flew, and dropped, and\ndived, on the bosom of the waters.I saw it--Where did I see it?--Was it\nnot from the high peaks of Dunbarton, when I looked westward upon the\nfertile land, and northward on the wild Highland hills; when the clouds\ngathered and the tempest came, and the lightnings of heaven flashed in\nsheets as wide as the banners of an host?--What did I see?--Dead corpses\nand wounded horses, the rushing together of battle, and garments rolled\nin blood.--What heard I?--The voice that cried, Slay, slay--smite--slay\nutterly--let not your eye have pity!slay utterly, old and young, the\nmaiden, the child, and the woman whose head is grey--Defile the house and\nfill the courts with the slain!""We receive the command," exclaimed more than one of the company."Six\ndays he hath not spoken nor broken bread, and now his tongue is\nunloosed:--We receive the command; as he hath said, so will we do."Astonished, disgusted, and horror-struck, at what he had seen and heard,\nMorton turned away from the circle and left the cottage.He was followed\nby Burley, who had his eye on his motions.said the latter, taking him by the arm."Any where,--I care not whither; but here I will abide no longer.""Art thou so soon weary, young man?""Thy hand is but\nnow put to the plough, and wouldst thou already abandon it?Is this thy\nadherence to the cause of thy father?""No cause," replied Morton, indignantly--"no cause can prosper, so\nconducted.One party declares for the ravings of a bloodthirsty madman;\nanother leader is an old scholastic pedant; a third"--he stopped, and his\ncompanion continued the sentence--"Is a desperate homicide, thou wouldst\nsay, like John Balfour of Burley?--I can bear thy misconstruction without\nresentment.Thou dost not consider, that it is not men of sober and\nself-seeking minds, who arise in these days of wrath to execute judgment\nand to accomplish deliverance.Hadst thou but seen the armies of England,\nduring her Parliament of 1640, whose ranks were filled with sectaries and\nenthusiasts, wilder than the anabaptists of Munster, thou wouldst have\nhad more cause to marvel; and yet these men were unconquered on the\nfield, and their hands wrought marvellous things for the liberties of the\nland.""But their affairs," replied Morton, "were wisely conducted, and the\nviolence of their zeal expended itself in their exhortations and sermons,\nwithout bringing divisions into their counsels, or cruelty into their\nconduct.I have often heard my father say so, and protest, that he\nwondered at nothing so much as the contrast between the extravagance of\ntheir religious tenets, and the wisdom and moderation with which they\nconducted their civil and military affairs.But our councils seem all one\nwild chaos of confusion.""Thou must have patience, Henry Morton," answered Balfour; "thou must not\nleave the cause of thy religion and country either for one wild word, or\none extravagant action.I have already persuaded the wiser of\nour friends, that the counsellors are too numerous, and that we cannot\nexpect that the Midianites shall, by so large a number, be delivered into\nour hands.They have hearkened to my voice, and our assemblies will be\nshortly reduced within such a number as can consult and act together; and\nin them thou shalt have a free voice, as well as in ordering our affairs\nof war, and protecting those to whom mercy should be shown--Art thou now\nsatisfied?""It will give me pleasure, doubtless," answered Morton, "to be the means\nof softening the horrors of civil war; and I will not leave the post I\nhave taken, unless I see measures adopted at which my conscience revolts.But to no bloody executions after quarter asked, or slaughter without\ntrial, will I lend countenance or sanction; and you may depend on my\nopposing them, with both heart and hand, as constantly and resolutely, if\nattempted by our own followers, as when they are the work of the enemy.""Thou wilt find," he said, "that the stubborn and hard-hearted generation\nwith whom we deal, must be chastised with scorpions ere their hearts be\nhumbled, and ere they accept the punishment of their iniquity.The word\nis gone forth against them, \'I will bring a sword upon you that shall\navenge the quarrel of my Covenant.\'But what is done shall be done\ngravely, and with discretion, like that of the worthy James Melvin, who\nexecuted judgment on the tyrant and oppressor, Cardinal Beaton.""I own to you," replied Morton, "that I feel still more abhorrent at\ncold-blooded and premeditated cruelty, than at that which is practised in\nthe heat of zeal and resentment.""Thou art yet but a youth," replied Balfour, "and hast not learned how\nlight in the balance are a few drops of blood in comparison to the weight\nand importance of this great national testimony.But be not afraid;\nthyself shall vote and judge in these matters; it may be we shall see\nlittle cause to strive together anent them."With this concession Morton was compelled to be satisfied for the\npresent; and Burley left him, advising him to lie down and get some rest,\nas the host would probably move in the morning."And you," answered Morton, "do not you go to rest also?""No," said Burley; "my eyes must not yet know slumber.This is no work to\nbe done lightly; I have yet to perfect the choosing of the committee of\nleaders, and I will call you by times in the morning to be present at\ntheir consultation."He turned away, and left Morton to his repose.The place in which he found himself was not ill adapted for the purpose,\nbeing a sheltered nook, beneath a large rock, well protected from the\nprevailing wind.A quantity of moss with which the ground was overspread,\nmade a couch soft enough for one who had suffered so much hardship and\nanxiety.Morton wrapped himself in the horse-man\'s cloak which he had\nstill retained, stretched himself on the ground, and had not long\nindulged in melancholy reflections on the state of the country, and upon\nhis own condition, ere he was relieved from them by deep and sound\nslumber.The rest of the army slept on the ground, dispersed in groups, which\nchose their beds on the fields as they could best find shelter and\nconvenience.A few of the principal leaders held wakeful conference with\nBurley on the state of their affairs, and some watchmen were appointed\nwho kept themselves on the alert by chanting psalms, or listening to the\nexercises of the more gifted of their number.Got with much ease--now merrily to horse.Part I.\n\nWith the first peep of day Henry awoke, and found the faithful Cuddie\nstanding beside him with a portmanteau in his hand."I hae been just putting your honour\'s things in readiness again ye were\nwaking," said Cuddie, "as is my duty, seeing ye hae been sae gude as to\ntak me into your service.""I take you into my service, Cuddie?"said Morton, "you must be\ndreaming.""Na, na, stir," answered Cuddie; "didna I say when I was tied on the\nhorse yonder, that if ever ye gat loose I would be your servant, and ye\ndidna say no?and if that isna hiring, I kenna what is.Ye gae me nae\narles, indeed, but ye had gien me eneugh before at Milnwood.""Well, Cuddie, if you insist on taking the chance of my unprosperous\nfortunes"--\n\n"Ou ay, I\'se warrant us a\' prosper weel eneugh," answered Cuddie,\ncheeringly, "an anes my auld mither was weel putten up.I hae begun the\ncampaigning trade at an end that is easy eneugh to learn."said Morton, "for how else could you come by that\nportmanteau?""I wotna if it\'s pillaging, or how ye ca\'t," said Cuddie, "but it comes\nnatural to a body, and it\'s a profitable trade.Our folk had tirled the\ndead dragoons as bare as bawbees before we were loose amaist.--But when I\nsaw the Whigs a\' weel yokit by the lugs to Kettledrummle and the other\nchield, I set off at the lang trot on my ain errand and your honour\'s.Sae I took up the syke a wee bit, away to the right, where I saw the\nmarks o\'mony a horsefoot, and sure eneugh I cam to a place where there\nhad been some clean leatherin\', and a\' the puir chields were lying there\nbuskit wi\' their claes just as they had put them on that morning--naebody\nhad found out that pose o\' carcages--and wha suld be in the midst thereof\n(as my mither says) but our auld acquaintance, Sergeant Bothwell?""Troth has he," answered Cuddie; "and his een were open and his brow\nbent, and his teeth clenched thegither, like the jaws of a trap for\nfoumarts when the spring\'s doun--I was amaist feared to look at him;\nhowever, I thought to hae turn about wi\' him, and sae I e\'en riped his\npouches, as he had dune mony an honester man\'s; and here\'s your ain\nsiller again (or your uncle\'s, which is the same) that he got at Milnwood\nthat unlucky night that made us a\' sodgers thegither.""There can be no harm, Cuddie," said Morton, "in making use of this\nmoney, since we know how he came by it; but you must divide with me.""Bide a wee, bide a wee," said Cuddie."Weel, and there\'s a bit ring he\nhad hinging in a black ribbon doun on his breast.I am thinking it has\nbeen a love-token, puir fallow--there\'s naebody sae rough but they hae\naye a kind heart to the lasses--and there\'s a book wi\'a wheen papers, and\nI got twa or three odd things, that I\'ll keep to mysell, forby.""Upon my word, you have made a very successful foray for a beginner,"\nsaid his new master.said Cuddie, with great exultation."I tauld ye I\nwasna that dooms stupid, if it cam to lifting things.--And forby, I hae\ngotten twa gude horse.A feckless loon of a Straven weaver, that has left\nhis loom and his bein house to sit skirling on a cauld hill-side, had\ncatched twa dragoon naigs, and he could neither gar them hup nor wind,\nsae he took a gowd noble for them baith--I suld hae tried him wi\' half\nthe siller, but it\'s an unco ill place to get change in--Ye\'ll find the\nsiller\'s missing out o\' Bothwell\'s purse.""You have made a most excellent and useful purchase, Cuddie; but what is\nthat portmanteau?"answered Cuddie, "it was Lord Evandale\'s yesterday, and\nit\'s yours the day.I fand it ahint the bush o\' broom yonder--ilka dog\nhas its day--Ye ken what the auld sang says,\n\n          \'Take turn about, mither, quo\' Tam o\' the Linn.\'"And, speaking o\' that, I maun gang and see about my mither, puir auld\nbody, if your honour hasna ony immediate commands.""But, Cuddie," said Morton, "I really cannot take these things from you\nwithout some recompense.""Hout fie, stir," answered Cuddie, "ye suld aye be taking,--for\nrecompense, ye may think about that some other time--I hae seen gay weel\nto mysell wi\' some things that fit me better.What could I do wi\' Lord\nEvandale\'s braw claes?Sergeant Bothwell\'s will serve me weel eneugh."Not being able to prevail on the self-constituted and disinterested\nfollower to accept of any thing for himself out of these warlike spoils,\nMorton resolved to take the first opportunity of returning Lord\nEvandale\'s property, supposing him yet to be alive; and, in the\nmeanwhile, did not hesitate to avail himself of Cuddie\'s prize, so far as\nto appropriate some changes of linen and other triffling articles amongst\nthose of more value which the portmanteau contained.He then hastily looked over the papers which were found in Bothwell\'s\npocket-book.The roll of his\ntroop, with the names of those absent on furlough, memorandums of\ntavern-bills, and lists of delinquents who might be made subjects of fine\nand persecution, first presented themselves, along with a copy of a\nwarrant from the Privy Council to arrest certain persons of distinction\ntherein named.In another pocket of the book were one or two commissions\nwhich Bothwell had held at different times, and certificates of his\nservices abroad, in which his courage and military talents were highly\npraised.But the most remarkable paper was an accurate account of his\ngenealogy, with reference to many documents for establishment of its\nauthenticity; subjoined was a list of the ample possessions of the\nforfeited Earls of Bothwell, and a particular account of the proportions\nin which King James VI.had bestowed them on the courtiers and nobility\nby whose descendants they were at present actually possessed; beneath\nthis list was written, in red letters, in the hand of the deceased, Haud\nImmemor, F. S. E. B. the initials probably intimating Francis Stewart,\nEarl of Bothwell.To these documents, which strongly painted the\ncharacter and feelings of their deceased proprietor, were added some\nwhich showed him in a light greatly different from that in which we have\nhitherto presented him to the reader.In a secret pocket of the book, which Morton did not discover without\nsome trouble, were one or two letters, written in a beautiful female\nhand.They were dated about twenty years back, bore no address, and were\nsubscribed only by initials.Without having time to peruse them\naccurately, Morton perceived that they contained the elegant yet fond\nexpressions of female affection directed towards an object whose jealousy\nthey endeavoured to soothe, and of whose hasty, suspicious, and impatient\ntemper, the writer seemed gently to complain.The ink of these\nmanuscripts had faded by time, and, notwithstanding the great care which\nhad obviously been taken for their preservation, they were in one or two\nplaces chafed so as to be illegible."It matters not," these words were written on the envelope of that which\nhad suffered most, "I have them by heart."With these letters was a lock of hair wrapped in a copy of verses,\nwritten obviously with a feeling, which atoned, in Morton\'s opinion, for\nthe roughness of the poetry, and the conceits with which it abounded,\naccording to the taste of the period:\n\nThy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright, As in that well-remember\'d\nnight, When first thy mystic braid was wove, And first my Agnes whisper\'d\nlove.Since then, how often hast thou press\'d The torrid zone of this\nwild breast, Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell With the first sin\nwhich peopled hell; A breast whose blood\'s a troubled ocean, Each throb\nthe earthquake\'s wild commotion!--O, if such clime thou canst endure, Yet\nkeep thy hue unstain\'d and pure, What conquest o\'er each erring thought\nOf that fierce realm had Agnes wrought!I had not wander\'d wild and wide,\nWith such an angel for my guide; Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove\nme, If she had lived, and lived to love me.Not then this world\'s wild\njoys had been To me one savage hunting-scene, My sole delight the\nheadlong race, And frantic hurry of the chase, To start, pursue, and\nbring to bay, Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey, Then from the carcass\nturn away; Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed, And soothed each wound\nwhich pride inflamed;--Yes, God and man might now approve me, If thou\nhadst lived, and lived to love me!As he finished reading these lines, Morton could not forbear reflecting\nwith compassion on the fate of this singular and most unhappy being, who,\nit appeared, while in the lowest state of degradation, and almost of\ncontempt, had his recollections continually fixed on the high station to\nwhich his birth seemed to entitle him; and, while plunged in gross\nlicentiousness, was in secret looking back with bitter remorse to the\nperiod of his youth, during which he had nourished a virtuous, though\nunfortunate attachment.what are we," said Morton, "that our best and most praiseworthy\nfeelings can be thus debased and depraved--that honourable pride can sink\ninto haughty and desperate indifference for general opinion, and the\nsorrow of blighted affection inhabit the same bosom which license,\nrevenge, and rapine, have chosen for their citadel?But it is the same\nthroughout; the liberal principles of one man sink into cold and\nunfeeling indifference, the religious zeal of another hurries him into\nfrantic and savage enthusiasm.Our resolutions, our passions, are like\nthe waves of the sea, and, without the aid of Him who formed the human\nbreast, we cannot say to its tides, \'Thus far shall ye come, and no\nfarther."\'While he thus moralized, he raised his eyes, and observed that Burley\nstood before him.said that leader--"It is well, and shows zeal to tread\nthe path before you.--What papers are these?"Morton gave him some brief account of Cuddie\'s successful marauding\nparty, and handed him the pocket-book of Bothwell, with its contents.The\nCameronian leader looked with some attention on such of the papers as\nrelated to military affairs, or public business; but when he came to the\nverses, he threw them from him with contempt."I little thought," he said, "when, by the blessing of God, I passed my\nsword three times through the body of that arch tool of cruelty and\npersecution, that a character so desperate and so dangerous could have\nstooped to an art as trifling as it is profane.But I see that Satan can\nblend the most different qualities in his well-beloved and chosen agents,\nand that the same hand which can wield a club or a slaughter-weapon\nagainst the godly in the valley of destruction, can touch a tinkling\nlute, or a gittern, to soothe the ears of the dancing daughters of\nperdition in their Vanity Fair.""Your ideas of duty, then," said Morton, "exclude love of the fine arts,\nwhich have been supposed in general to purify and to elevate the mind?""To me, young man," answered Burley, "and to those who think as I do, the\npleasures of this world, under whatever name disguised, are vanity, as\nits grandeur and power are a snare.We have but one object on earth, and\nthat is to build up the temple of the Lord.""I have heard my father observe," replied Morton, "that many who assumed\npower in the name of Heaven, were as severe in its exercise, and as\nunwilling to part with it, as if they had been solely moved by the\nmotives of worldly ambition--But of this another time.Have you succeeded\nin obtaining a committee of the council to be nominated?""The number is limited to six, of which you\nare one, and I come to call you to their deliberations."Morton accompanied him to a sequestered grassplot, where their colleagues\nawaited them.In this delegation of authority, the two principal factions\nwhich divided the tumultuary army had each taken care to send three of\ntheir own number.On the part of the Cameronians, were Burley, Macbriar,\nand Kettledrummle; and on that of the moderate party, Poundtext, Henry\nMorton, and a small proprietor, called the Laird of Langcale.Thus the\ntwo parties were equally balanced by their representatives in the\ncommittee of management, although it seemed likely that those of the most\nviolent opinions were, as is usual in such cases, to possess and exert\nthe greater degree of energy.Their debate, however, was conducted more\nlike men of this world than could have been expected from their conduct\non the preceding evening.After maturely considering their means and\nsituation, and the probable increase of their numbers, they agreed that\nthey would keep their position for that day, in order to refresh their\nmen, and give time to reinforcements to join them, and that, on the next\nmorning, they would direct their march towards Tillietudlem, and summon\nthat stronghold, as they expressed it, of malignancy.If it was not\nsurrendered to their summons, they resolved to try the effect of a brisk\nassault; and, should that miscarry, it was settled that they should leave\na part of their number to blockade the place, and reduce it, if possible,\nby famine, while their main body should march forward to drive\nClaverhouse and Lord Ross from the town of Glasgow.Such was the\ndetermination of the council of management; and thus Morton\'s first\nenterprise in active life was likely to be the attack of a castle\nbelonging to the parent of his mistress, and defended by her relative,\nMajor Bellenden, to whom he personally owed many obligations!He felt\nfully the embarrassment of his situation, yet consoled himself with the\nreflection, that his newly-acquired power in the insurgent army would\ngive him, at all events, the means of extending to the inmates of\nTillietudlem a protection which no other circumstance could have afforded\nthem; and he was not without hope that he might be able to mediate such\nan accommodation betwixt them and the presbyterian army, as should secure\nthem a safe neutrality during the war which was about to ensue.There came a knight from the field of slain,\n               His steed was drench\'d in blood and rain.We must now return to the fortress of Tillietudlem and its inhabitants.The morning, being the first after the battle of Loudon-hill, had dawned\nupon its battlements, and the defenders had already resumed the labours\nby which they proposed to render the place tenable, when the watchman,\nwho was placed in a high turret, called the Warder\'s Tower, gave the\nsignal that a horseman was approaching.As he came nearer, his dress\nindicated an officer of the Life-Guards; and the slowness of his horse\'s\npace, as well as the manner in which the rider stooped on the saddle-bow,\nplainly showed that he was sick or wounded.The wicket was instantly\nopened to receive him, and Lord Evandale rode into the court-yard, so\nreduced by loss of blood, that he was unable to dismount without\nassistance.As he entered the hall, leaning upon a servant, the ladies\nshrieked with surprise and terror; for, pale as death, stained with\nblood, his regimentals soiled and torn, and his hair matted and\ndisordered, he resembled rather a spectre than a human being.But their\nnext exclamation was that of joy at his escape.exclaimed Lady Margaret, "that you are here, and have\nescaped the hands of the bloodthirsty murderers who have cut off so many\nof the king\'s loyal servants!"added Edith, "that you are here and in safety!But you are wounded, and I fear we have little the\nmeans of assisting you.""My wounds are only sword-cuts," answered the young nobleman, as he\nreposed himself on a seat; "the pain is not worth mentioning, and I\nshould not even feel exhausted but for the loss of blood.But it was not\nmy purpose to bring my weakness to add to your danger and distress, but\nto relieve them, if possible.What can I do for you?--Permit me," he\nadded, addressing Lady Margaret--"permit me to think and act as your son,\nmy dear madam--as your brother, Edith!"He pronounced the last part of the sentence with some emphasis, as if he\nfeared that the apprehension of his pretensions as a suitor might render\nhis proffered services unacceptable to Miss Bellenden.She was not\ninsensible to his delicacy, but there was no time for exchange of\nsentiments."We are preparing for our defence," said the old lady with great dignity;\n"my brother has taken charge of our garrison, and, by the grace of God,\nwe will give the rebels such a reception as they deserve.""How gladly," said Evandale, "would I share in the defence of the Castle!But in my present state, I should be but a burden to you, nay, something\nworse; for, the knowledge that an officer of the Life-Guards was in the\nCastle would be sufficient to make these rogues more desperately earnest\nto possess themselves of it.If they find it defended only by the family,\nthey may possibly march on to Glasgow rather than hazard an assault.""And can you think so meanly of us, my lord," said Edith, with the\ngenerous burst of feeling which woman so often evinces, and which becomes\nher so well, her voice faltering through eagerness, and her brow\ncolouring with the noble warmth which dictated her language--"Can you\nthink so meanly of your friends, as that they would permit such\nconsiderations to interfere with their sheltering and protecting you at a\nmoment when you are unable to defend yourself, and when the whole country\nis filled with the enemy?Is there a cottage in Scotland whose owners\nwould permit a valued friend to leave it in such circumstances?And can\nyou think we will allow you to go from a castle which we hold to be\nstrong enough for our own defence?""Lord Evandale need never think of it," said Lady Margaret."I will dress\nhis wounds myself; it is all an old wife is fit for in war time; but to\nquit the Castle of Tillietudlem when the sword of the enemy is drawn to\nslay him,--the meanest trooper that ever wore the king\'s coat on his back\nshould not do so, much less my young Lord Evandale.--Ours is not a house\nthat ought to brook such dishonour.The tower of Tillietudlem has been\ntoo much distinguished by the visit of his most sacred"--\n\nHere she was interrupted by the entrance of the Major."We have taken a prisoner, my dear uncle," said Edith--"a wounded\nprisoner, and he wants to escape from us.You must help us to keep him by\nforce.""I am as much pleased as when I\ngot my first commission.Claverhouse reported you were killed, or missing\nat least.""I should have been slain, but for a friend of yours," said Lord\nEvandale, speaking with some emotion, and bending his eyes on the ground,\nas if he wished to avoid seeing the impression that what he was about to\nsay would make upon Miss Bellenden."I was unhorsed and defenceless, and\nthe sword raised to dispatch me, when young Mr Morton, the prisoner for\nwhom you interested yourself yesterday morning, interposed in the most\ngenerous manner, preserved my life, and furnished me with the means of\nescaping."As he ended the sentence, a painful curiosity overcame his first\nresolution; he raised his eyes to Edith\'s face, and imagined he could\nread in the glow of her cheek and the sparkle of her eye, joy at hearing\nof her lover\'s safety and freedom, and triumph at his not having been\nleft last in the race of generosity.Such, indeed, were her feelings; but\nthey were also mingled with admiration of the ready frankness with which\nLord Evandale had hastened to bear witness to the merit of a favoured\nrival, and to acknowledge an obligation which, in all probability, he\nwould rather have owed to any other individual in the world.Major Bellenden, who would never have observed the emotions of either\nparty, even had they been much more markedly expressed, contented himself\nwith saying, "Since Henry Morton has influence with these rascals, I am\nglad he has so exerted it; but I hope he will get clear of them as soon\nas he can.I know his principles, and that he\ndetests their cant and hypocrisy.I have heard him laugh a thousand times\nat the pedantry of that old presbyterian scoundrel, Poundtext, who, after\nenjoying the indulgence of the government for so many years, has now,\nupon the very first ruffle, shown himself in his own proper colours, and\nset off, with three parts of his cropeared congregation, to join the host\nof the fanatics.--But how did you escape after leaving the field, my\nlord?""I rode for my life, as a recreant knight must," answered Lord Evandale,\nsmiling."I took the route where I thought I had least chance of meeting\nwith any of the enemy, and I found shelter for several hours--you will\nhardly guess where.""At Castle Bracklan, perhaps," said Lady Margaret, "or in the house of\nsome other loyal gentleman?"I was repulsed, under one mean pretext or another, from more\nthan one house of that description, for fear of the enemy following my\ntraces; but I found refuge in the cottage of a poor widow, whose husband\nhad been shot within these three months by a party of our corps, and\nwhose two sons are at this very moment with the insurgents."said Lady Margaret Bellenden; "and was a fanatic woman capable\nof such generosity?--but she disapproved, I suppose, of the tenets of her\nfamily?""Far from it, madam," continued the young nobleman; "she was in principle\na rigid recusant, but she saw my danger and distress, considered me as a\nfellow-creature, and forgot that I was a cavalier and a soldier.She\nbound my wounds, and permitted me to rest upon her bed, concealed me from\na party of the insurgents who were seeking for stragglers, supplied me\nwith food, and did not suffer me to leave my place of refuge until she\nhad learned that I had every chance of getting to this tower without\ndanger.""It was nobly done," said Miss Bellenden; "and I trust you will have an\nopportunity of rewarding her generosity.""I am running up an arrear of obligation on all sides, Miss Bellenden,\nduring these unfortunate occurrences," replied Lord Evandale; "but when I\ncan attain the means of showing my gratitude, the will shall not be\nwanting."All now joined in pressing Lord Evandale to relinquish his intention of\nleaving the Castle; but the argument of Major Bellenden proved the most\neffectual."Your presence in the Castle will be most useful, if not absolutely\nnecessary, my lord, in order to maintain, by your authority, proper\ndiscipline among the fellows whom Claverhouse has left in garrison here,\nand who do not prove to be of the most orderly description of inmates;\nand, indeed, we have the Colonel\'s authority, for that very purpose, to\ndetain any officer of his regiment who might pass this way.""That," said Lord Evandale, "is an unanswerable argument, since it shows\nme that my residence here may be useful, even in my present disabled\nstate.""For your wounds, my lord," said the Major, "if my sister, Lady\nBellenden, will undertake to give battle to any feverish symptom, if such\nshould appear, I will answer that my old campaigner, Gideon Pike, shall\ndress a flesh-wound with any of the incorporation of Barber-Surgeons.He\nhad enough of practice in Montrose\'s time, for we had few regularly-bred\narmy chirurgeons, as you may well suppose.--You agree to stay with us,\nthen?""My reasons for leaving the Castle," said Lord Evandale, glancing a look\ntowards Edith, "though they evidently seemed weighty, must needs give way\nto those which infer the power of serving you.May I presume, Major, to\nenquire into the means and plan of defence which you have prepared?or\ncan I attend you to examine the works?"It did not escape Miss Bellenden, that Lord Evandale seemed much\nexhausted both in body and mind."I think, sir," she said, addressing the\nMajor, "that since Lord Evandale condescends to become an officer of our\ngarrison, you should begin by rendering him amenable to your authority,\nand ordering him to his apartment, that he may take some refreshment ere\nhe enters on military discussions.""Edith is right," said the old lady; "you must go instantly to bed, my\nlord, and take some febrifuge, which I will prepare with my own hand; and\nmy lady-in-waiting, Mistress Martha Weddell, shall make some friar\'s\nchicken, or something very light.I would not advise wine.--John Gudyill,\nlet the housekeeper make ready the chamber of dais.Lord Evandale must\nlie down instantly.Pike will take off the dressings, and examine the\nstate of the wounds.""These are melancholy preparations, madam," said Lord Evandale, as he\nreturned thanks to Lady Margaret, and was about to leave the hall,--"but\nI must submit to your ladyship\'s directions; and I trust that your skill\nwill soon make me a more able defender of your castle than I am at\npresent.You must render my body serviceable as soon as you can, for you\nhave no use for my head while you have Major Bellenden.""An excellent young man, and a modest," said the Major."None of that conceit," said Lady Margaret, "that often makes young folk\nsuppose they know better how their complaints should be treated than\npeople that have had experience.""And so generous and handsome a young nobleman," said Jenny Dennison, who\nhad entered during the latter part of this conversation, and was now left\nalone with her mistress in the hall, the Major returning to his military\ncares, and Lady Margaret to her medical preparations.Edith only answered these encomiums with a sigh; but, although silent,\nshe felt and knew better than any one how much they were merited by the\nperson on whom they were bestowed.Jenny, however, failed not to follow\nup her blow."After a\', it\'s true that my lady says--there\'s nae trusting a\npresbyterian; they are a\' faithless man-sworn louns.Whae wad hae thought\nthat young Milnwood and Cuddie Headrigg wad hae taen on wi\' thae rebel\nblackguards?""What do you mean by such improbable nonsense, Jenny?"said her young\nmistress, very much displeased."I ken it\'s no pleasing for you to hear, madam," answered Jenny hardily;\n"and it\'s as little pleasant for me to tell; but as gude ye suld ken a\'\nabout it sune as syne, for the haill Castle\'s ringing wi\'t.""Just that Henry Morton of Milnwood is out wi\' the rebels, and ane o\'\ntheir chief leaders."said Edith--"a most base calumny!and you are very\nbold to dare to repeat it to me.Henry Morton is incapable of such\ntreachery to his king and country--such cruelty to me--to--to all the\ninnocent and defenceless victims, I mean, who must suffer in a civil\nwar--I tell you he is utterly incapable of it, in every sense."Miss Edith," replied Jenny, still constant to her text,\n"they maun be better acquainted wi\' young men than I am, or ever wish to\nbe, that can tell preceesely what they\'re capable or no capable o\'.But\nthere has been Trooper Tam, and another chield, out in bonnets and grey\nplaids, like countrymen, to recon--reconnoitre--I think John Gudyill ca\'d\nit; and they hae been amang the rebels, and brought back word that they\nhad seen young Milnwood mounted on ane o\' the dragoon horses that was\ntaen at Loudon-hill, armed wi\' swords and pistols, like wha but him, and\nhand and glove wi\' the foremost o\' them, and dreeling and commanding the\nmen; and Cuddie at the heels o\' him, in ane o\' Sergeant Bothwell\'s laced\nwaistcoats, and a cockit hat with a bab o\' blue ribbands at it for the\nauld cause o\' the Covenant, (but Cuddie aye liked a blue ribband,) and a\nruffled sark, like ony lord o\' the land--it sets the like o\' him,\nindeed!""Jenny," said her young mistress hastily, "it is impossible these men\'s\nreport can be true; my uncle has heard nothing of it at this instant.""Because Tam Halliday," answered the handmaiden, "came in just five\nminutes after Lord Evandale; and when he heard his lordship was in the\nCastle, he swore (the profane loon!)he would be d--d ere he would make\nthe report, as he ca\'d it, of his news to Major Bellenden, since there\nwas an officer of his ain regiment in the garrison.Sae he wad have said\nnaething till Lord Evandale wakened the next morning; only he tauld me\nabout it," (here Jenny looked a little down,) "just to vex me about\nCuddie.""Poh, you silly girl," said Edith, assuming some courage, "it is all a\ntrick of that fellow to teaze you.""Na, madam, it canna be that, for John Gudyill took the other dragoon\n(he\'s an auld hard-favoured man, I wotna his name) into the cellar, and\ngae him a tass o\' brandy to get the news out o\' him, and he said just the\nsame as Tam Halliday, word for word; and Mr Gudyill was in sic a rage,\nthat he tauld it a\' ower again to us, and says the haill rebellion is\nowing to the nonsense o\' my Leddy and the Major, and Lord Evandale, that\nbegged off young Milnwood and Cuddie yesterday morning, for that, if they\nhad suffered, the country wad hae been quiet--and troth I am muckle o\'\nthat opinion mysell."This last commentary Jenny added to her tale, in resentment of her\nmistress\'s extreme and obstinate incredulity.She was instantly alarmed,\nhowever, by the effect which her news produced upon her young lady, an\neffect rendered doubly violent by the High-church principles and\nprejudices in which Miss Bellenden had been educated.Her complexion\nbecame as pale as a corpse, her respiration so difficult that it was on\nthe point of altogether failing her, and her limbs so incapable of\nsupporting her, that she sunk, rather than sat, down upon one of the\nseats in the hall, and seemed on the eve of fainting.Jenny tried cold\nwater, burnt feathers, cutting of laces, and all other remedies usual in\nhysterical cases, but without any immediate effect.said the repentant fille-de-chambre."I\nwish my tongue had been cuttit out!--Wha wad hae thought o\' her taking on\nthat way, and a\' for a young lad?--O, Miss Edith--dear Miss Edith, haud\nyour heart up about it, it\'s maybe no true for a\' that I hae said--O, I\nwish my mouth had been blistered!A\' body tells me my tongue will do me a\nmischief some day.or the Major?--and she\'s\nsitting in the throne, too, that naebody has sate in since that weary\nmorning the King was here!--O, what will I do!O, what will become o\'\nus!"While Jenny Dennison thus lamented herself and her mistress, Edith slowly\nreturned from the paroxysm into which she had been thrown by this\nunexpected intelligence."If he had been unfortunate," she said, "I never would have deserted him.I never did so, even when there was danger and disgrace in pleading his\ncause.If he had died, I would have mourned him--if he had been\nunfaithful, I would have forgiven him; but a rebel to his King,--a\ntraitor to his country,--the associate and colleague of cut-throats and\ncommon stabbers,--the persecutor of all that is noble,--the professed and\nblasphemous enemy of all that is sacred,--I will tear him from my heart,\nif my life-blood should ebb in the effort!"She wiped her eyes, and rose hastily from the great chair, (or throne, as\nLady Margaret used to call it,) while the terrified damsel hastened to\nshake up the cushion, and efface the appearance of any one having\noccupied that sacred seat; although King Charles himself, considering the\nyouth and beauty as well as the affliction of the momentary usurper of\nhis hallowed chair, would probably have thought very little of the\nprofanation.She then hastened officiously to press her support on Edith,\nas she paced the hall apparently in deep meditation."Tak my arm, madam; better just tak my arm; sorrow maun hae its vent, and\ndoubtless"--\n\n"No, Jenny," said Edith, with firmness; "you have seen my weakness, and\nyou shall see my strength.""But ye leaned on me the other morning.Miss Edith, when ye were sae sair\ngrieved.""Misplaced and erring affection may require support, Jenny--duty can\nsupport itself; yet I will do nothing rashly.I will be aware of the\nreasons of his conduct--and then--cast him off for ever," was the firm\nand determined answer of her young lady.Overawed by a manner of which she could neither conceive the motive, nor\nestimate the merit, Jenny muttered between her teeth, "Odd, when the\nfirst flight\'s ower, Miss Edith taks it as easy as I do, and muckle\neasier, and I\'m sure I ne\'er cared half sae muckle about Cuddie Headrigg\nas she did about young Milnwood.Forby that, it\'s maybe as weel to hae a\nfriend on baith sides; for, if the whigs suld come to tak the Castle, as\nit\'s like they may, when there\'s sae little victual, and the dragoons\nwasting what\'s o\'t, ou, in that case, Milnwood and Cuddie wad hae the\nupper hand, and their freendship wad be worth siller--I was thinking sae\nthis morning or I heard the news."With this consolatory reflection the damsel went about her usual\noccupations, leaving her mistress to school her mind as she best might,\nfor eradicating the sentiments which she had hitherto entertained towards\nHenry Morton.Once more into the breach--dear friends, once more!Henry V.\n\nOn the evening of this day, all the information which they could procure\nled them to expect, that the insurgent army would be with early dawn on\ntheir march against Tillietudlem.Lord Evandale\'s wounds had been\nexamined by Pike, who reported them in a very promising state.They were\nnumerous, but none of any consequence; and the loss of blood, as much\nperhaps as the boasted specific of Lady Margaret, had prevented any\ntendency to fever; so that, notwithstanding he felt some pain and great\nweakness, the patient maintained that he was able to creep about with the\nassistance of a stick.In these circumstances he refused to be confined\nto his apartment, both that he might encourage the soldiers by his\npresence, and suggest any necessary addition to the plan of defence,\nwhich the Major might be supposed to have arranged upon something of an\nantiquated fashion of warfare.Lord Evandale was well qualified to give\nadvice on such subjects, having served, during his early youth, both in\nFrance and in the Low Countries.There was little or no occasion,\nhowever, for altering the preparations already made; and, excepting on\nthe article of provisions, there seemed no reason to fear for the defence\nof so strong a place against such assailants as those by whom it was\nthreatened.With the peep of day, Lord Evandale and Major Bellenden were on the\nbattlements again, viewing and re-viewing the state of their\npreparations, and anxiously expecting the approach of the enemy.I ought\nto observe, that the report of the spies had now been regularly made and\nreceived; but the Major treated the report that Morton was in arms\nagainst the government with the most scornful incredulity."I know the lad better," was the only reply he deigned to make; "the\nfellows have not dared to venture near enough, and have been deceived by\nsome fanciful resemblance, or have picked up some story.""I differ from you, Major," answered Lord Evandale; "I think you will see\nthat young gentleman at the head of the insurgents; and, though I shall\nbe heartily sorry for it, I shall not be greatly surprised.""You are as bad as Claverhouse," said the Major, "who contended yesterday\nmorning down my very throat, that this young fellow, who is as\nhigh-spirited and gentleman-like a boy as I have ever known, wanted but\nan opportunity to place himself at the head of the rebels.""And considering the usage which he has received, and the suspicions\nunder which he lies," said Lord Evandale, "what other course is open to\nhim?For my own part, I should hardly know whether he deserved most blame\nor pity.""Blame, my lord?--Pity!"echoed the Major, astonished at hearing such\nsentiments; "he would deserve to be hanged, that\'s all; and, were he my\nown son, I should see him strung up with pleasure--Blame, indeed!But\nyour lordship cannot think as you are pleased to speak?""I give you my honour, Major Bellenden, that I have been for some time of\nopinion, that our politicians and prelates have driven matters to a\npainful extremity in this country, and have alienated, by violence of\nvarious kinds, not only the lower classes, but all those in the upper\nranks, whom strong party-feeling, or a desire of court-interest, does not\nattach to their standard.""I am no politician," answered the Major, "and I do not understand nice\ndistinctions.My sword is the King\'s, and when he commands, I draw it in\nhis cause.""I trust," replied the young lord, "you will not find me more backward\nthan yourself, though I heartily wish that the enemy were foreigners.It\nis, however, no time to debate that matter, for yonder they come, and we\nmust defend ourselves as well as we can."As Lord Evandale spoke, the van of the insurgents began to make their\nappearance on the road which crossed the top of the hill, and thence\ndescended opposite to the Tower.They did not, however, move downwards,\nas if aware that, in doing so, their columns would be exposed to the fire\nof the artillery of the place.But their numbers, which at first seemed\nfew, appeared presently so to deepen and concentrate themselves, that,\njudging of the masses which occupied the road behind the hill from the\ncloseness of the front which they presented on the top of it, their force\nappeared very considerable.There was a pause of anxiety on both sides;\nand, while the unsteady ranks of the Covenanters were agitated, as if by\npressure behind, or uncertainty as to their next movement, their arms,\npicturesque from their variety, glanced in the morning sun, whose beams\nwere reflected from a grove of pikes, muskets, halberds, and battle-axes.The armed mass occupied, for a few minutes, this fluctuating position,\nuntil three or four horsemen, who seemed to be leaders, advanced from the\nfront, and occupied the height a little nearer to the Castle.John\nGudyill, who was not without some skill as an artilleryman, brought a gun\nto bear on this detached group."I\'ll flee the falcon,"--(so the small cannon was called,)--"I\'ll flee\nthe falcon whene\'er your honour gies command; my certie, she\'ll ruffle\ntheir feathers for them!""Stay a moment," said the young nobleman, "they send us a flag of truce."In fact, one of the horsemen at that moment dismounted, and, displaying a\nwhite cloth on a pike, moved forward towards the Tower, while the Major\nand Lord Evandale, descending from the battlement of the main fortress,\nadvanced to meet him as far as the barricade, judging it unwise to admit\nhim within the precincts which they designed to defend.At the same time\nthat the ambassador set forth, the group of horsemen, as if they had\nanticipated the preparations of John Gudyill for their annoyance,\nwithdrew from the advanced station which they had occupied, and fell back\nto the main body.The envoy of the Covenanters, to judge by his mien and manner, seemed\nfully imbued with that spiritual pride which distinguished his sect.His\nfeatures were drawn up to a contemptuous primness, and his half-shut eyes\nseemed to scorn to look upon the terrestial objects around, while, at\nevery solemn stride, his toes were pointed outwards with an air that\nappeared to despise the ground on which they trode.Lord Evandale could\nnot suppress a smile at this singular figure."Did you ever," said he to Major Bellenden, "see such an absurd\nautomaton?One would swear it moves upon springs--Can it speak, think\nyou?""O, ay," said the Major; "that seems to be one of my old acquaintance, a\ngenuine puritan of the right pharisaical leaven.--Stay--he coughs and\nhems; he is about to summon the Castle with the but-end of a sermon,\ninstead of a parley on the trumpet."The veteran, who in his day had had many an opportunity to become\nacquainted with the manners of these religionists, was not far mistaken\nin his conjecture; only that, instead of a prose exordium, the Laird of\nLangcale--for it was no less a personage--uplifted, with a Stentorian\nvoice, a verse of the twenty-fourth Psalm:\n\n"Ye gates lift up your heads!ye doors, Doors that do last for aye, Be\nlifted up"--\n\n"I told you so," said the Major to Evandale, and then presented himself\nat the entrance of the barricade, demanding to know for what purpose or\nintent he made that doleful noise, like a hog in a high wind, beneath the\ngates of the Castle."I come," replied the ambassador, in a high and shrill voice, and without\nany of the usual salutations or deferences,--"I come from the godly army\nof the Solemn League and Covenant, to speak with two carnal malignants,\nWilliam Maxwell, called Lord Evandale, and Miles Bellenden of Charnwood.""And what have you to say to Miles Bellenden and Lord Evandale?"said the Laird of Langcale, in the same sharp,\nconceited, disrespectful tone of voice."Even so, for fault of better," said the Major."Then there is the public summons," said the envoy, putting a paper into\nLord Evandale\'s hand, "and there is a private letter for Miles Bellenden\nfrom a godly youth, who is honoured with leading a part of our host.Read\nthem quickly, and God give you grace to fructify by the contents, though\nit is muckle to be doubted."The summons ran thus: "We, the named and constituted leaders of the\ngentlemen, ministers, and others, presently in arms for the cause of\nliberty and true religion, do warn and summon William Lord Evandale and\nMiles Bellenden of Charnwood, and others presently in arms, and keeping\ngarrison in the Tower of Tillietudlem, to surrender the said Tower upon\nfair conditions of quarter, and license to depart with bag and baggage,\notherwise to suffer such extremity of fire and sword as belong by the\nlaws of war to those who hold out an untenable post.And so may God\ndefend his own good cause!"This summons was signed by John Balfour of Burley, as quarter-master\ngeneral of the army of the Covenant, for himself, and in name of the\nother leaders.The letter to Major Bellenden was from Henry Morton.It was couched in\nthe following language:\n\n"I have taken a step, my venerable friend, which, among many painful\nconsequences, will, I am afraid, incur your very decided disapprobation.But I have taken my resolution in honour and good faith, and with the\nfull approval of my own conscience.I can no longer submit to have my own\nrights and those of my fellow-subjects trampled upon, our freedom\nviolated, our persons insulted, and our blood spilt, without just cause\nor legal trial.Providence, through the violence of the oppressors\nthemselves, seems now to have opened a way of deliverance from this\nintolerable tyranny, and I do not hold him deserving of the name and\nrights of a freeman, who, thinking as I do, shall withold his arm from\nthe cause of his country.But God, who knows my heart, be my witness,\nthat I do not share the angry or violent passions of the oppressed and\nharassed sufferers with whom I am now acting.My most earnest and anxious\ndesire is, to see this unnatural war brought to a speedy end, by the\nunion of the good, wise, and moderate of all parties, and a peace\nrestored, which, without injury to the King\'s constitutional rights, may\nsubstitute the authority of equal laws to that of military violence, and,\npermitting to all men to worship God according to their own consciences,\nmay subdue fanatical enthusiasm by reason and mildness, instead of\ndriving it to frenzy by persecution and intolerance."With these sentiments, you may conceive with what pain I appear in arms\nbefore the house of your venerable relative, which we understand you\npropose to hold out against us.Permit me to press upon you the\nassurance, that such a measure will only lead to the effusion of\nblood--that, if repulsed in the assault, we are yet strong enough to\ninvest the place, and reduce it by hunger, being aware of your\nindifferent preparations to sustain a protracted siege.It would grieve\nme to the heart to think what would be the sufferings in such a case,\nand upon whom they would chiefly fall."Do not suppose, my respected friend, that I would propose to you any\nterms which could compromise the high and honourable character which you\nhave so deservedly won, and so long borne.If the regular soldiers (to\nwhom I will ensure a safe retreat) are dismissed from the place, I trust\nno more will be required than your parole to remain neuter during this\nunhappy contest; and I will take care that Lady Margaret\'s property, as\nwell as yours, shall be duly respected, and no garrison intruded upon\nyou.I could say much in favour of this proposal; but I fear, as I must\nin the present instance appear criminal in your eyes, good arguments\nwould lose their influence when coming from an unwelcome quarter.I will,\ntherefore, break off with assuring you, that whatever your sentiments may\nbe hereafter towards me, my sense of gratitude to you can never be\ndiminished or erased; and it would be the happiest moment of my life that\nshould give me more effectual means than mere words to assure you of it.Therefore, although in the first moment of resentment you may reject the\nproposal I make to you, let not that prevent you from resuming the topic,\nif future events should render it more acceptable; for whenever, or\nhowsoever, I can be of service to you, it will always afford the greatest\nsatisfaction to\n                                     "Henry Morton."Having read this long letter with the most marked indignation, Major\nBellenden put it into the hands of Lord Evandale."I would not have believed this," he said, "of Henry Morton, if half\nmankind had sworn it!rebellious in\ncold blood, and without even the pretext of enthusiasm, that warms the\nliver of such a crack-brained <DW2> as our friend the envoy there.But I\nshould have remembered he was a presbyterian--I ought to have been aware\nthat I was nursing a wolf-cub, whose diabolical nature would make him\ntear and snatch at me on the first opportunity.Were Saint Paul on earth\nagain, and a presbyterian, he would be a rebel in three months--it is in\nthe very blood of them.""Well," said Lord Evandale, "I will be the last to recommend surrender;\nbut, if our provisions fail, and we receive no relief from Edinburgh or\nGlasgow, I think we ought to avail ourselves of this opening, to get the\nladies, at least, safe out of the Castle.""They will endure all, ere they would accept the protection of such a\nsmooth-tongued hypocrite," answered the Major indignantly; "I would\nrenounce them for relatives were it otherwise.But let us dismiss the\nworthy ambassador.--My friend," he said, turning to Langcale, "tell your\nleaders, and the mob they have gathered yonder, that, if they have not a\nparticular opinion of the hardness of their own skulls, I would advise\nthem to beware how they knock them against these old walls.And let them\nsend no more flags of truce, or we will hang up the messenger in\nretaliation of the murder of Cornet Grahame."With this answer the ambassador returned to those by whom he had been\nsent.He had no sooner reached the main body than a murmur was heard\namongst the multitude, and there was raised in front of their ranks an\nample red flag, the borders of which were edged with blue.As the signal\nof war and defiance spread out its large folds upon the morning wind, the\nancient banner of Lady Margaret\'s family, together with the royal ensign,\nwere immediately hoisted on the walls of the Tower, and at the same time,\na round of artillery was discharged against the foremost ranks of the\ninsurgents, by which they sustained some loss.Their leaders instantly\nwithdrew them to the shelter of the brow of the hill."I think," said John Gudyill, while he busied himself in re-charging his\nguns, "they hae fund the falcon\'s neb a bit ower hard for them--It\'s no\nfor nought that the hawk whistles."But as he uttered these words, the ridge was once more crowded with the\nranks of the enemy.A general discharge of their fire-arms was directed\nagainst the defenders upon the battlements.Under cover of the smoke, a\ncolumn of picked men rushed down the road with determined courage, and,\nsustaining with firmness a heavy fire from the garrison, they forced\ntheir way, in spite of opposition, to the first barricade by which the\navenue was defended.They were led on by Balfour in person, who displayed\ncourage equal to his enthusiasm; and, in spite of every opposition,\nforced the barricade, killing and wounding several of the defenders, and\ncompelling the rest to retreat to their second position.The precautions,\nhowever, of Major Bellenden rendered this success unavailing; for no\nsooner were the Covenanters in possession of the post, than a close and\ndestructive fire was poured into it from the Castle, and from those\nstations which commanded it in the rear.Having no means of protecting\nthemselves from this fire, or of returning it with effect against men who\nwere under cover of their barricades and defences, the Covenanters were\nobliged to retreat; but not until they had, with their axes, destroyed\nthe stockade, so as to render it impossible for the defenders to\nre-occupy it.Balfour was the last man that retired.He even remained for a short space\nalmost alone, with an axe in his hand, labouring like a pioneer amid the\nstorm of balls, many of which were specially aimed against him.The\nretreat of the party he commanded was not effected without heavy loss,\nand served as a severe lesson concerning the local advantages possessed\nby the garrison.The next attack of the Covenanters was made with more caution.A strong\nparty of marksmen, (many of them competitors at the game of the\npopinjay,) under the command of Henry Morton, glided through the woods\nwhere they afforded them the best shelter, and, avoiding the open road,\nendeavoured, by forcing their way through the bushes and trees, and up\nthe rocks which surrounded it on either side, to gain a position, from\nwhich, without being exposed in an intolerable degree, they might annoy\nthe flank of the second barricade, while it was menaced in front by a\nsecond attack from Burley.The besieged saw the danger of this movement,\nand endeavoured to impede the approach of the marksmen, by firing upon\nthem at every point where they showed themselves.The assailants, on the\nother hand, displayed great coolness, spirit, and judgment, in the manner\nin which they approached the defences.This was, in a great measure, to\nbe ascribed to the steady and adroit manner in which they were conducted\nby their youthful leader, who showed as much skill in protecting his own\nfollowers as spirit in annnoying the enemy.He repeatedly enjoined his marksmen to direct their aim chiefly upon the\nred-coats, and to save the others engaged in the defence of the Castle;\nand, above all, to spare the life of the old Major, whose anxiety made\nhim more than once expose himself in a manner, that, without such\ngenerosity on the part of the enemy, might have proved fatal.A dropping\nfire of musketry now glanced from every part of the precipitous mount on\nwhich the Castle was founded.From bush to bush--from crag to crag--from\ntree to tree, the marksmen continued to advance, availing themselves of\nbranches and roots to assist their ascent, and contending at once with\nthe disadvantages of the ground and the fire of the enemy.At length they\ngot so high on the ascent, that several of them possessed an opportunity\nof firing into the barricade against the defenders, who then lay exposed\nto their aim, and Burley, profiting by the confusion of the moment, moved\nforward to the attack in front.His onset was made with the same\ndesperation and fury as before, and met with less resistance, the\ndefenders being alarmed at the progress which the sharp-shooters had made\nin turning the flank of their position.Determined to improve his\nadvantage, Burley, with his axe in his hand, pursued the party whom he\nhad dislodged even to the third and last barricade, and entered it along\nwith them."Kill, kill--down with the enemies of God and his people!--No\nquarter--The Castle is ours!"were the cries by which he animated his\nfriends; the most undaunted of whom followed him close, whilst the\nothers, with axes, spades, and other implements, threw up earth, cut\ndown trees, hastily labouring to establish such a defensive cover in the\nrear of the second barricade as might enable them to retain possession\nof it, in case the Castle was not carried by this coup-de-main.Lord Evandale could no longer restrain his impatience.He charged with a\nfew soldiers who had been kept in reserve in the court-yard of the\nCastle; and, although his arm was in a sling, encouraged them, by voice\nand gesture, to assist their companions who were engaged with Burley.The\ncombat now assumed an air of desperation.The narrow road was crowded\nwith the followers of Burley, who pressed forward to support their\ncompanions.The soldiers, animated by the voice and presence of Lord\nEvandale, fought with fury, their small numbers being in some measure\ncompensated by their greater skill, and by their possessing the upper\nground, which they defended desperately with pikes and halberds, as well\nas with the but of the carabines and their broadswords.Those within the\nCastle endeavoured to assist their companions, whenever they could so\nlevel their guns as to fire upon the enemy without endangering their\nfriends.The sharp-shooters, dispersed around, were firing incessantly on\neach object that was exposed upon the battlement.The Castle was\nenveloped with smoke, and the rocks rang to the cries of the combatants.In the midst of this scene of confusion, a singular accident had nearly\ngiven the besiegers possession of the fortress.Cuddie Headrigg, who had advanced among the marksmen, being well\nacquainted with every rock and bush in the vicinity of the Castle, where\nhe had so often gathered nuts with Jenny Dennison, was enabled, by such\nlocal knowledge, to advance farther, and with less danger, than most of\nhis companions, excepting some three or four who had followed him close.Now Cuddie, though a brave enough fellow upon the whole, was by no means\nfond of danger, either for its own sake, or for that of the glory which\nattends it.In his advance, therefore, he had not, as the phrase goes,\ntaken the bull by the horns, or advanced in front of the enemy\'s fire.On\nthe contrary, he had edged gradually away from the scene of action, and,\nturning his line of ascent rather to the left, had pursued it until it\nbrought him under a front of the Castle different from that before which\nthe parties were engaged, and to which the defenders had given no\nattention, trusting to the steepness of the precipice.There was,\nhowever, on this point, a certain window belonging to a certain pantry,\nand communicating with a certain yew-tree, which grew out of a steep\ncleft of the rock, being the very pass through which Goose Gibbie was\nsmuggled out of the Castle in order to carry Edith\'s express to\nCharnwood, and which had probably, in its day, been used for other\ncontraband purposes.Cuddie, resting upon the but of his gun, and looking\nup at this window, observed to one of his companions,--"There\'s a place I\nken weel; mony a time I hae helped Jenny Dennison out o\' the winnock,\nforby creeping in whiles mysell to get some daffin, at e\'en after the\npleugh was loosed.""And what\'s to hinder us to creep in just now?"said the other, who was a\nsmart enterprising young fellow."There\'s no muckle to hinder us, an that were a\'," answered Cuddie; "but\nwhat were we to do neist?""We\'ll take the Castle," cried the other; "here are five or six o\' us,\nand a\' the sodgers are engaged at the gate.""Come awa wi\' you, then," said Cuddie; "but mind, deil a finger ye maun\nlay on Lady Margaret, or Miss Edith, or the auld Major, or, aboon a\', on\nJenny Dennison, or ony body but the sodgers--cut and quarter amang them\nas ye like, I carena.""Ay, ay," said the other, "let us once in, and we will make our ain terms\nwith them a\'."Gingerly, and as if treading upon eggs, Cuddie began to ascend the\nwell-known pass, not very willingly; for, besides that he was something\napprehensive of the reception he might meet with in the inside, his\nconscience insisted that he was making but a shabby requital for Lady\nMargaret\'s former favours and protection.He got up, however, into the\nyew-tree, followed by his companions, one after another.The window was\nsmall, and had been secured by stancheons of iron; but these had been\nlong worn away by time, or forced out by the domestics to possess a free\npassage for their own occasional convenience.Entrance was therefore\neasy, providing there was no one in the pantry, a point which Cuddie\nendeavoured to discover before he made the final and perilous step.While\nhis companions, therefore, were urging and threatening him behind, and he\nwas hesitating and stretching his neck to look into the apartment, his\nhead became visible to Jenny Dennison, who had ensconced herself in said\npantry as the safest place in which to wait the issue of the assault.So\nsoon as this object of terror caught her eye, she set up a hysteric\nscream, flew to the adjacent kitchen, and, in the desperate agony of\nfear, seized on a pot of kailbrose which she herself had hung on the fire\nbefore the combat began, having promised to Tam Halliday to prepare his\nbreakfast for him.Thus burdened, she returned to the window of the\npantry, and still exclaiming, "Murder!murder!--we are a\' harried and\nravished--the Castle\'s taen--tak it amang ye!"she discharged the whole\nscalding contents of the pot, accompanied with a dismal yell, upon the\nperson of the unfortunate Cuddie.However welcome the mess might have\nbeen, if Cuddie and it had become acquainted in a regular manner, the\neffects, as administered by Jenny, would probably have cured him of\nsoldiering for ever, had he been looking upwards when it was thrown upon\nhim.But, fortunately for our man of war, he had taken the alarm upon\nJenny\'s first scream, and was in the act of looking down, expostulating\nwith his comrades, who impeded the retreat which he was anxious to\ncommence; so that the steel cap and buff coat which formerly belonged to\nSergeant Bothwell, being garments of an excellent endurance, protected\nhis person against the greater part of the scalding brose.Enough,\nhowever, reached him to annoy him severely, so that in the pain and\nsurprise he jumped hastily out of the tree, oversetting his followers, to\nthe manifest danger of their limbs, and, without listening to arguments,\nentreaties, or authority, made the best of his way by the most safe road\nto the main body of the army whereunto he belonged, and could neither by\nthreats nor persuasion be prevailed upon to return to the attack.[Illustration: Jenny Dennison--050]\n\n\nAs for Jenny, when she had thus conferred upon one admirer\'s outward man\nthe viands which her fair hands had so lately been in the act of\npreparing for the stomach of another, she continued her song of alarm,\nrunning a screaming division upon all those crimes, which the lawyers\ncall the four pleas of the crown, namely, murder, fire, rape, and\nrobbery.These hideous exclamations gave so much alarm, and created such\nconfusion within the Castle, that Major Bellenden and Lord Evandale\njudged it best to draw off from the conflict without the gates, and,\nabandoning to the enemy all the exterior defences of the avenue, confine\nthemselves to the Castle itself, for fear of its being surprised on some\nunguarded point.Their retreat was unmolested; for the panic of Cuddie\nand his companions had occasioned nearly as much confusion on the side\nof the besiegers, as the screams of Jenny had caused to the defenders.There was no attempt on either side to renew the action that day.The\ninsurgents had suffered most severely; and, from the difficulty which\nthey had experienced in carrying the barricadoed positions without the\nprecincts of the Castle, they could have but little hope of storming the\nplace itself.On the other hand, the situation of the besieged was\ndispiriting and gloomy.In the skirmishing they had lost two or three\nmen, and had several wounded; and though their loss was in proportion\ngreatly less than that of the enemy, who had left twenty men dead on the\nplace, yet their small number could much worse spare it, while the\ndesperate attacks of the opposite party plainly showed how serious the\nleaders were in the purpose of reducing the place, and how well seconded\nby the zeal of their followers.But, especially, the garrison had to fear\nfor hunger, in case blockade should be resorted to as the means of\nreducing them.The Major\'s directions had been imperfectly obeyed in\nregard to laying in provisions; and the dragoons, in spite of all warning\nand authority, were likely to be wasteful in using them.It was,\ntherefore, with a heavy heart, that Major Bellenden gave directions for\nguarding the window through which the Castle had so nearly been\nsurprised, as well as all others which offered the most remote facility\nfor such an enterprise.CHAPTER V.\n\n               The King hath drawn\n               The special head of all the land together.The leaders of the presbyterian army had a serious consultation upon the\nevening of the day in which they had made the attack on Tillietudlem.They could not but observe that their followers were disheartened by the\nloss which they had sustained, and which, as usual in such cases, had\nfallen upon the bravest and most forward.It was to be feared, that if\nthey were suffered to exhaust their zeal and efforts in an object so\nsecondary as the capture of this petty fort, their numbers would melt\naway by degrees, and they would lose all the advantages arising out of\nthe present unprepared state of the government.Moved by these arguments,\nit was agreed that the main body of the army should march against\nGlasgow, and dislodge the soldiers who were lying in that town.The\ncouncil nominated Henry Morton, with others, to this last service, and\nappointed Burley to the command of a chosen body of five hundred men, who\nwere to remain behind, for the purpose of blockading the Tower of\nTillietudlem.Morton testified the greatest repugnance to this\narrangement."He had the strongest personal motives," he said, "for desiring to remain\nnear Tillietudlem; and if the management of the siege were committed to\nhim, he had little doubt but that he would bring it to such an\naccommodation, as, without being rigorous to the besieged, would fully\nanswer the purpose of the besiegers."Burley readily guessed the cause of his young colleague\'s reluctance to\nmove with the army; for, interested as he was in appreciating the\ncharacters with whom he had to deal, he had contrived, through the\nsimplicity of Cuddie, and the enthusiasm of old Mause, to get much\ninformation concerning Morton\'s relations with the family of\nTillietudlem.He therefore took the advantage of Poundtext\'s arising to\nspeak to business, as he said, for some short space of time, (which\nBurley rightly interpreted to mean an hour at the very least), and seized\nthat moment to withdraw Morton from the hearing of their colleagues, and\nto hold the following argument with him:\n\n"Thou art unwise, Henry Morton, to desire to sacrifice this holy cause to\nthy friendship for an uncircumcised Philistine, or thy lust for a\nMoabitish woman.""I neither understand your meaning, Mr Balfour, nor relish your\nallusions," replied Morton, indignantly; "and I know no reason you have\nto bring so gross a charge, or to use such uncivil language.""Confess, however, the truth," said Balfour, "and own that there are\nthose within yon dark Tower, over whom thou wouldst rather be watching\nlike a mother over her little ones, than thou wouldst bear the banner of\nthe Church of Scotland over the necks of her enemies.""If you mean, that I would willingly terminate this war without any\nbloody victory, and that I am more anxious to do this than to acquire any\npersonal fame or power, you may be," replied Morton, "perfectly right.""And not wholly wrong," answered Burley, "in deeming that thou wouldst\nnot exclude from so general a pacification thy friends in the garrison of\nTillietudlem.""Certainly," replied Morton; "I am too much obliged to Major Bellenden\nnot to wish to be of service to him, as far as the interest of the cause\nI have espoused will permit.I never made a secret of my regard for him.""I am aware of that," said Burley; "but, if thou hadst concealed it, I\nshould, nevertheless, have found out thy riddle.Now, hearken to my\nwords.This Miles Bellenden hath means to subsist his garrison for a\nmonth.""This is not the case," answered Morton; "we know his stores are hardly\nequal to a week\'s consumption.""Ay, but," continued Burley, "I have since had proof, of the strongest\nnature, that such a report was spread in the garrison by that wily and\ngrey-headed malignant, partly to prevail on the soldiers to submit to a\ndiminution of their daily food, partly to detain us before the walls of\nhis fortress until the sword should be whetted to smite and destroy us.""And why was not the evidence of this laid before the council of war?""Why need we undeceive Kettledrummle,\nMacbriar, Poundtext, and Langcale, upon such a point?Thyself must own,\nthat whatever is told to them escapes to the host out of the mouth of the\npreachers at their next holding-forth.They are already discouraged by\nthe thoughts of lying before the fort a week.What would be the\nconsequence were they ordered to prepare for the leaguer of a month?""But why conceal it, then, from me?and, above\nall, what proofs have you got of the fact?""There are many proofs," replied Burley; and he put into his hands a\nnumber of requisitions sent forth by Major Bellenden, with receipts on\nthe back to various proprietors, for cattle, corn, meal, to such an\namount, that the sum total seemed to exclude the possibility of the\ngarrison being soon distressed for provisions.But Burley did not inform\nMorton of a fact which he himself knew full well, namely, that most of\nthese provisions never reached the garrison, owing to the rapacity of the\ndragoons sent to collect them, who readily sold to one man what they took\nfrom another, and abused the Major\'s press for stores, pretty much as Sir\nJohn Falstaff did that of the King for men."And now," continued Balfour, observing that he had made the desired\nimpression, "I have only to say, that I concealed this from thee no\nlonger than it was concealed from myself, for I have only received these\npapers this morning; and I tell it unto thee now, that thou mayest go on\nthy way rejoicing, and work the great work willingly at Glasgow, being\nassured that no evil can befall thy friends in the malignant party, since\ntheir fort is abundantly victualled, and I possess not numbers sufficient\nto do more against them than to prevent their sallying forth.""And why," continued Morton, who felt an inexpressible reluctance to\nacquiesce in Balfour\'s reasoning--"why not permit me to remain in the\ncommand of this smaller party, and march forward yourself to Glasgow?"And therefore, young man," answered Burley, "have I laboured that it\nshould be committed to the son of Silas Morton.I am waxing old, and this\ngrey head has had enough of honour where it could be gathered by danger.I speak not of the frothy bubble which men call earthly fame, but the\nhonour belonging to him that doth not the work negligently.But thy\ncareer is yet to run.Thou hast to vindicate the high trust which has\nbeen bestowed on thee through my assurance that it was dearly\nwell-merited.At Loudon-hill thou wert a captive, and at the last assault\nit was thy part to fight under cover, whilst I led the more open and\ndangerous attack; and, shouldst thou now remain before these walls when\nthere is active service elsewhere, trust me, that men will say, that the\nson of Silas Morton hath fallen away from the paths of his father."Stung by this last observation, to which, as a gentleman and soldier, he\ncould offer no suitable reply, Morton hastily acquiesced in the proposed\narrangement.Yet he was unable to divest himself of certain feelings of\ndistrust which he involuntarily attached to the quarter from which he\nreceived this information."Mr Balfour," he said, "let us distinctly understand each other.You have\nthought it worth your while to bestow particular attention upon my\nprivate affairs and personal attachments; be so good as to understand,\nthat I am as constant to them as to my political principles.It is\npossible, that, during my absence, you may possess the power of soothing\nor of wounding those feelings.Be assured, that whatever may be the\nconsequences to the issue of our present adventure, my eternal gratitude,\nor my persevering resentment, will attend the line of conduct you may\nadopt on such an occasion; and, however young and inexperienced I am, I\nhave no doubt of finding friends to assist me in expressing my sentiments\nin either case.""If there be a threat implied in that denunciation," replied Burley,\ncoldly and haughtily, "it had better have been spared.I know how to\nvalue the regard of my friends, and despise, from my soul, the threats of\nmy enemies.Whatever happens\nhere in your absence shall be managed with as much deference to your\nwishes, as the duty I owe to a higher power can possibly permit."With this qualified promise Morton was obliged to rest satisfied."Our defeat will relieve the garrison," said he, internally, "ere they\ncan be reduced to surrender at discretion; and, in case of victory, I\nalready see, from the numbers of the moderate party, that I shall have a\nvoice as powerful as Burley\'s in determining the use which shall be made\nof it."He therefore followed Balfour to the council, where they found\nKettledrummle adding to his lastly a few words of practical application.When these were expended, Morton testified his willingness to accompany\nthe main body of the army, which was destined to drive the regular troops\nfrom Glasgow.His companions in command were named, and the whole\nreceived a strengthening exhortation from the preachers who were present.Next morning, at break of day, the insurgent army broke up from their\nencampment, and marched towards Glasgow.It is not our intention to detail at length incidents which may be found\nin the history of the period.It is sufficient to say, that Claverhouse\nand Lord Ross, learning the superior force which was directed against\nthem, intrenched, or rather barricadoed themselves, in the centre of the\ncity, where the town-house and old jail were situated, with the\ndetermination to stand the assault of the insurgents rather than to\nabandon the capital of the west of Scotland.The presbyterians made their\nattack in two bodies, one of which penetrated into the city in the line\nof the College and Cathedral Church, while the other marched up the\nGallowgate, or principal access from the south-east.Both divisions were\nled by men of resolution, and behaved with great spirit.But the\nadvantages of military skill and situation were too great for their\nundisciplined valour.Ross and Claverhouse had carefully disposed parties of their soldiers in\nhouses, at the heads of the streets, and in the entrances of closes, as\nthey are called, or lanes, besides those who were intrenched behind\nbreast-works which reached across the streets.The assailants found their\nranks thinned by a fire from invisible opponents, which they had no means\nof returning with effect.It was in vain that Morton and other leaders\nexposed their persons with the utmost gallantry, and endeavoured to bring\ntheir antagonists to a close action; their followers shrunk from them in\nevery direction.And yet, though Henry Morton was one of the very last to\nretire, and exerted himself in bringing up the rear, maintaining order in\nthe retreat, and checking every attempt which the enemy made to improve\nthe advantage they had gained by the repulse, he had still the\nmortification to hear many of those in his ranks muttering to each other,\nthat "this came of trusting to latitudinarian boys; and that, had honest,\nfaithful Burley led the attack, as he did that of the barricades of\nTillietudlem, the issue would have been as different as might be."It was with burning resentment that Morton heard these reflections thrown\nout by the very men who had soonest exhibited signs of discouragement.The unjust reproach, however, had the effect of firing his emulation, and\nmaking him sensible that, engaged as he was in a perilous cause, it was\nabsolutely necessary that he should conquer or die."I have no retreat," he said to himself."All shall allow--even Major\nBellenden--even Edith--that in courage, at least, the rebel Morton was\nnot inferior to his father."The condition of the army after the repulse was so undisciplined, and in\nsuch disorganization, that the leaders thought it prudent to draw off\nsome miles from the city to gain time for reducing them once more into\nsuch order as they were capable of adopting.Recruits, in the meanwhile,\ncame fast in, more moved by the extreme hardships of their own condition,\nand encouraged by the advantage obtained at Loudon-hill, than deterred by\nthe last unfortunate enterprise.Many of these attached themselves\nparticularly to Morton\'s division.He had, however, the mortification to\nsee that his unpopularity among the more intolerant part of the\nCovenanters increased rapidly.The prudence beyond his years, which he\nexhibited in improving the discipline and arrangement of his followers,\nthey termed a trusting in the arm of flesh, and his avowed tolerance for\nthose of religious sentiments and observances different from his own,\nobtained him, most unjustly, the nickname of Gallio, who cared for none\nof those things.What was worse than these misconceptions, the mob of the\ninsurgents, always loudest in applause of those who push political or\nreligious opinions to extremity, and disgusted with such as endeavour to\nreduce them to the yoke of discipline, preferred avowedly the more\nzealous leaders, in whose ranks enthusiasm in the cause supplied the want\nof good order and military subjection, to the restraints which Morton\nendeavoured to bring them under.In short, while bearing the principal\nburden of command, (for his colleagues willingly relinquished in his\nfavour every thing that was troublesome and obnoxious in the office of\ngeneral,) Morton found himself without that authority, which alone could\nrender his regulations effectual.[Note: These feuds, which tore to\npieces the little army of insurgents, turned merely on the point whether\nthe king\'s interest or royal authority was to be owned or not, and\nwhether the party in arms were to be contented with a free exercise of\ntheir own religion, or insist upon the re-establishment of Presbytery in\nits supreme authority, and with full power to predominate over all other\nforms of worship.The few country gentlemen who joined the insurrection,\nwith the most sensible part of the clergy, thought it best to limit their\ndemands to what it might be possible to attain.But the party who urged\nthese moderate views were termed by the more zealous bigots, the Erastian\nparty, men, namely, who were willing to place the church under the\ninfluence of the civil government, and therefore they accounted them, "a\nsnare upon Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."See the Life of Sir\nRobert Hamilton in the Scottish Worthies, and his account of the Battle\nof Both-well-bridge, passim.]Yet, notwithstanding these obstacles, he had, during the course of a few\ndays, laboured so hard to introduce some degree of discipline into the\narmy, that he thought he might hazard a second attack upon Glasgow with\nevery prospect of success.It cannot be doubted that Morton\'s anxiety to measure himself with\nColonel Grahame of Claverhouse, at whose hands he had sustained such\ninjury, had its share in giving motive to his uncommon exertions.But\nClaverhouse disappointed his hopes; for, satisfied with having the\nadvantage in repulsing the first attack upon Glasgow, he determined that\nhe would not, with the handful of troops under his command, await a\nsecond assault from the insurgents, with more numerous and better\ndisciplined forces than had supported their first enterprise.He\ntherefore evacuated the place, and marched at the head of his troops\ntowards Edinburgh.The insurgents of course entered Glasgow without\nresistance, and without Morton having the opportunity, which he so deeply\ncoveted, of again encountering Claverhouse personally.But, although he\nhad not an opportunity of wiping away the disgrace which had befallen his\ndivision of the army of the Covenant, the retreat of Claverhouse, and the\npossession of Glasgow, tended greatly to animate the insurgent army, and\nto increase its numbers.The necessity of appointing new officers, of\norganizing new regiments and squadrons, of making them acquainted with at\nleast the most necessary points of military discipline, were labours,\nwhich, by universal consent, seemed to be devolved upon Henry Morton, and\nwhich he the more readily undertook, because his father had made him\nacquainted with the theory of the military art, and because he plainly\nsaw, that, unless he took this ungracious but absolutely necessary\nlabour, it was vain to expect any other to engage in it.In the meanwhile, fortune appeared to favour the enterprise of the\ninsurgents more than the most sanguine durst have expected.The Privy\nCouncil of Scotland, astonished at the extent of resistance which their\narbitrary measures had provoked, seemed stupified with terror, and\nincapable of taking active steps to subdue the resentment which these\nmeasures had excited.There were but very few troops in Scotland, and\nthese they drew towards Edinburgh, as if to form an army for protection\nof the metropolis.The feudal array of the crown vassals in the various\ncounties, was ordered to take the field, and render to the King the\nmilitary service due for their fiefs.But the summons was very slackly\nobeyed.The quarrel was not generally popular among the gentry; and even\nthose who were not unwilling themselves to have taken arms, were deterred\nby the repugnance of their wives, mothers, and sisters, to their engaging\nin such a cause.Meanwhile, the inadequacy of the Scottish government to provide for their\nown defence, or to put down a rebellion of which the commencement seemed\nso trifling, excited at the English court doubts at once of their\ncapacity, and of the prudence of the severities they had exerted against\nthe oppressed presbyterians.It was, therefore, resolved to nominate to\nthe command of the army of Scotland, the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth,\nwho had by marriage a great interest, large estate, and a numerous\nfollowing, as it was called, in the southern parts of that kingdom.The\nmilitary skill which he had displayed on different occasions abroad, was\nsupposed more than adequate to subdue the insurgents in the field; while\nit was expected that his mild temper, and the favourable disposition\nwhich he showed to presbyterians in general, might soften men\'s minds,\nand tend to reconcile them to the government.The Duke was, therefore,\ninvested with a commission, containing high powers for settling the\ndistracted affairs of Scotland, and dispatched from London with strong\nsuccours to take the principal military command in that country.I am bound to Bothwell-hill,\n                    Where I maun either do or die.[Illustration: The Battle of Bothwell Bridge--128\n\n\nThere was now a pause in the military movements on both sides.The\ngovernment seemed contented to prevent the rebels advancing towards the\ncapital, while the insurgents were intent upon augmenting and\nstrengthening their forces.For this purpose, they established a sort of\nencampment in the park belonging to the ducal residence at Hamilton, a\ncentrical situation for receiving their recruits, and where they were\nsecured from any sudden attack, by having the Clyde, a deep and rapid\nriver, in front of their position, which is only passable by a long and\nnarrow bridge, near the castle and village of Bothwell.Morton remained here for about a fortnight after the attack on Glasgow,\nactively engaged in his military duties.He had received more than one\ncommunication from Burley, but they only stated, in general, that the\nCastle of Tillietudlem continued to hold out.Impatient of suspense upon\nthis most interesting subject, he at length intimated to his colleagues\nin command his desire, or rather his intention,--for he saw no reason why\nhe should not assume a license which was taken by every one else in this\ndisorderly army,--to go to Milnwood for a day or two to arrange some\nprivate affairs of consequence.The proposal was by no means approved of;\nfor the military council of the insurgents were sufficiently sensible of\nthe value of his services to fear to lose them, and felt somewhat\nconscious of their own inability to supply his place.They could not,\nhowever, pretend to dictate to him laws more rigid than they submitted to\nthemselves, and he was suffered to depart on his journey without any\ndirect objection being stated.The Reverend Mr Poundtext took the same\nopportunity to pay a visit to his own residence in the neighbourhood of\nMilnwood, and favoured Morton with his company on the journey.As the\ncountry was chiefly friendly to their cause, and in possession of their\ndetached parties, excepting here and there the stronghold of some old\ncavaliering Baron, they travelled without any other attendant than the\nfaithful Cuddie.It was near sunset when they reached Milnwood, where Poundtext bid adieu\nto his companions, and travelled forward alone to his own manse, which\nwas situated half a mile\'s march beyond Tillietudlem.When Morton was\nleft alone to his own reflections, with what a complication of feelings\ndid he review the woods, banks, and fields, that had been familiar to\nhim!His character, as well as his habits, thoughts, and occupations, had\nbeen entirely changed within the space of little more than a fortnight,\nand twenty days seemed to have done upon him the work of as many years.A\nmild, romantic, gentle-tempered youth, bred up in dependence, and\nstooping patiently to the control of a sordid and tyrannical relation,\nhad suddenly, by the rod of oppression and the spur of injured feeling,\nbeen compelled to stand forth a leader of armed men, was earnestly\nengaged in affairs of a public nature, had friends to animate and enemies\nto contend with, and felt his individual fate bound up in that of a\nnational insurrection and revolution.It seemed as if he had at once\nexperienced a transition from the romantic dreams of youth to the labours\nand cares of active manhood.All that had formerly interested him was\nobliterated from his memory, excepting only his attachment to Edith; and\neven his love seemed to have assumed a character more manly and\ndisinterested, as it had become mingled and contrasted with other duties\nand feelings.As he revolved the particulars of this sudden change, the\ncircumstances in which it originated, and the possible consequences of\nhis present career, the thrill of natural anxiety which passed along his\nmind was immediately banished by a glow of generous and high-spirited\nconfidence."I shall fall young," he said, "if fall I must, my motives misconstrued,\nand my actions condemned, by those whose approbation is dearest to me.But the sword of liberty and patriotism is in my hand, and I will neither\nfall meanly nor unavenged.They may expose my body, and gibbet my limbs;\nbut other days will come, when the sentence of infamy will recoil against\nthose who may pronounce it.And that Heaven, whose name is so often\nprofaned during this unnatural war, will bear witness to the purity of\nthe motives by which I have been guided."Upon approaching Milnwood, Henry\'s knock upon the gate no longer\nintimated the conscious timidity of a stripling who has been out of\nbounds, but the confidence of a man in full possession of his own rights,\nand master of his own actions,--bold, free, and decided.The door was\ncautiously opened by his old acquaintance, Mrs Alison Wilson, who started\nback when she saw the steel cap and nodding plume of the martial visitor."In troth, ye\ngarr\'d my heart loup to my very mouth--But it canna be your ainsell, for\nye look taller and mair manly-like than ye used to do.""It is, however, my own self," said Henry, sighing and smiling at the\nsame time; "I believe this dress may make me look taller, and these\ntimes, Ailie, make men out of boys."echoed the old woman; "and O that you suld be\nendangered wi\'them!but wha can help it?--ye were ill eneugh guided, and,\nas I tell your uncle, if ye tread on a worm it will turn.""You were always my advocate, Ailie," said he, and the housekeeper no\nlonger resented the familiar epithet, "and would let no one blame me but\nyourself, I am aware of that,--Where is my uncle?""In Edinburgh," replied Alison; "the honest man thought it was best to\ngang and sit by the chimley when the reek rase--a vex\'d man he\'s been and\na feared--but ye ken the Laird as weel as I do.""I hope he has suffered nothing in health?""Naething to speak of," answered the housekeeper, "nor in gudes\nneither--we fended as weel as we could; and, though the troopers of\nTillietudlem took the red cow and auld Hackie, (ye\'ll mind them weel;)\nyet they sauld us a gude bargain o\' four they were driving to the\nCastle.""Ou, they cam out to gather marts for the garrison," answered the\nhousekeeper; "but they just fell to their auld trade, and rade through\nthe country couping and selling a\' that they gat, like sae mony\nwest-country drovers.My certie, Major Bellenden was laird o\' the least\nshare o\' what they lifted, though it was taen in his name.""Then," said Morton, hastily, "the garrison must be straitened for\nprovisions?""Stressed eneugh," replied Ailie--"there\'s little doubt o\' that.""Burley must have deceived me--craft as well as cruelty is permitted by\nhis creed."Such was his inward thought; he said aloud, "I cannot stay,\nMrs Wilson, I must go forward directly."bide to eat a mouthfu\'," entreated the affectionate\nhousekeeper, "and I\'ll mak it ready for you as I used to do afore thae\nsad days," "It is impossible," answered Morton.--"Cuddie, get our horses\nready.""They\'re just eating their corn," answered the attendant.exclaimed Ailie; "what garr\'d ye bring that ill-faur\'d, unlucky\nloon alang wi\' ye?--It was him and his randie mother began a\' the\nmischief in this house.""Tut, tut," replied Cuddie, "ye should forget and forgie, mistress.Mither\'s in Glasgow wi\' her tittie, and sall plague ye nae mair; and I\'m\nthe Captain\'s wallie now, and I keep him tighter in thack and rape than\never ye did;--saw ye him ever sae weel put on as he is now?""In troth and that\'s true," said the old housekeeper, looking with great\ncomplacency at her young master, whose mien she thought much improved by\nhis dress."I\'m sure ye ne\'er had a laced cravat like that when ye were\nat Milnwood; that\'s nane o\' my sewing.""Na, na, mistress," replied Cuddie, "that\'s a cast o\' my hand--that\'s ane\no\' Lord Evandale\'s braws."answered the old lady, "that\'s him that the whigs are\ngaun to hang the morn, as I hear say.""The whigs about to hang Lord Evandale?"said Morton, in the greatest\nsurprise."Ay, troth are they," said the housekeeper."Yesterday night he made a\nsally, as they ca\'t, (my mother\'s name was Sally--I wonder they gie\nChristian folk\'s names to sic unchristian doings,)--but he made an\noutbreak to get provisions, and his men were driven back and he was taen,\n\'an\' the whig Captain Balfour garr\'d set up a gallows, and swore, (or\nsaid upon his conscience, for they winna swear,) that if the garrison was\nnot gien ower the morn by daybreak, he would hing up the young lord, poor\nthing, as high as Haman.--These are sair times!--but folk canna help\nthem--sae do ye sit down and tak bread and cheese until better meat\'s\nmade ready.Ye suldna hae kend a word about it, an I had thought it was\nto spoil your dinner, hinny.""Fed, or unfed," exclaimed Morton, "saddle the horses instantly, Cuddie.We must not rest until we get before the Castle."And, resisting all Ailie\'s entreaties, they instantly resumed their\njourney.Morton failed not to halt at the dwelling of Poundtext, and summon him to\nattend him to the camp.That honest divine had just resumed for an\ninstant his pacific habits, and was perusing an ancient theological\ntreatise, with a pipe in his mouth, and a small jug of ale beside him, to\nassist his digestion of the argument.It was with bitter ill-will that he\nrelinquished these comforts (which he called his studies) in order to\nrecommence a hard ride upon a high-trotting horse.However, when he knew\nthe matter in hand, he gave up, with a deep groan, the prospect of\nspending a quiet evening in his own little parlour; for he entirely\nagreed with Morton, that whatever interest Burley might have in rendering\nthe breach between the presbyterians and the government irreconcilable,\nby putting the young nobleman to death, it was by no means that of the\nmoderate party to permit such an act of atrocity.And it is but doing\njustice to Mr Poundtext to add, that, like most of his own persuasion, he\nwas decidedly adverse to any such acts of unnecessary violence; besides,\nthat his own present feelings induced him to listen with much complacence\nto the probability held out by Morton, of Lord Evandale\'s becoming a\nmediator for the establishment of peace upon fair and moderate terms.With this similarity of views, they hastened their journey, and arrived\nabout eleven o\'clock at night at a small hamlet adjacent to the Castle at\nTillietudlem, where Burley had established his head-quarters.They were challenged by the sentinel, who made his melancholy walk at the\nentrance of the hamlet, and admitted upon declaring their names and\nauthority in the army.Another soldier kept watch before a house, which\nthey conjectured to be the place of Lord Evandale\'s confinement, for a\ngibbet of such great height as to be visible from the battlements of the\nCastle, was erected before it, in melancholy confirmation of the truth of\nMrs Wilson\'s report.[Note: The Cameronians had suffered persecution, but\nit was without learning mercy.We are informed by Captain Crichton, that\nthey had set up in their camp a huge gibbet, or gallows, having many\nhooks upon it, with a coil of new ropes lying beside it, for the\nexecution of such royalists as they might make prisoners.Guild, in his\nBellum Bothuellianum, describes this machine particularly.]Morton\ninstantly demanded to speak with Burley, and was directed to his\nquarters.They found him reading the Scriptures, with his arms lying\nbeside him, as if ready for any sudden alarm.He started upon the\nentrance of his colleagues in office."Is there bad news\nfrom the army?""No," replied Morton; "but we understand that there are measures adopted\nhere in which the safety of the army is deeply concerned--Lord Evandale\nis your prisoner?""The Lord," replied Burley, "hath delivered him into our hands.""And you will avail yourself of that advantage, granted you by Heaven, to\ndishonour our cause in the eyes of all the world, by putting a prisoner\nto an ignominious death?""If the house of Tillietudlem be not surrendered by daybreak," replied\nBurley, "God do so to me and more also, if he shall not die that death to\nwhich his leader and patron, John Grahame of Claverhouse, hath put so\nmany of God\'s saints.""We are in arms," replied Morton, "to put down such cruelties, and not to\nimitate them, far less to avenge upon the innocent the acts of the\nguilty.By what law can you justify the atrocity you would commit?""If thou art ignorant of it," replied Burley, "thy companion is well\naware of the law which gave the men of Jericho to the sword of Joshua,\nthe son of Nun.""But we," answered the divine, "live under a better dispensation, which\ninstructeth us to return good for evil, and to pray for those who\ndespitefully use us and persecute us.""That is to say," said Burley, "that thou wilt join thy grey hairs to his\ngreen youth to controvert me in this matter?""We are," rejoined Poundtext, "two of those to whom, jointly with\nthyself, authority is delegated over this host, and we will not permit\nthee to hurt a hair of the prisoner\'s head.It may please God to make him\na means of healing these unhappy breaches in our Israel.""I judged it would come to this," answered Burley, "when such as thou\nwert called into the council of the elders."answered Poundtext,--"And who am I, that you should name me\nwith such scorn?--Have I not kept the flock of this sheep-fold from the\nwolves for thirty years?Ay, even while thou, John Balfour, wert fighting\nin the ranks of uncircumcision, a Philistine of hardened brow and bloody\nhand--Who am I, say\'st thou?""I will tell thee what thou art, since thou wouldst so fain know," said\nBurley."Thou art one of those, who would reap where thou hast not sowed,\nand divide the spoil while others fight the battle--thou art one of those\nthat follow the gospel for the loaves and for the fishes--that love their\nown manse better than the Church of God, and that would rather draw their\nstipends under prelatists or heathens, than be a partaker with those\nnoble spirits who have cast all behind them for the sake of the\nCovenant.""And I will tell thee, John Balfour," returned Poundtext, deservedly\nincensed, "I will tell thee what thou art.Thou art one of those, for\nwhose bloody and merciless disposition a reproach is flung upon the whole\nchurch of this suffering kingdom, and for whose violence and\nblood-guiltiness, it is to be feared, this fair attempt to recover our\ncivil and religious rights will never be honoured by Providence with the\ndesired success.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "cease this irritating and unavailing\nrecrimination; and do you, Mr Balfour, inform us, whether it is your\npurpose to oppose the liberation of Lord Evandale, which appears to us a\nprofitable measure in the present position of our affairs?""You are here," answered Burley, "as two voices against one; but you will\nnot refuse to tarry until the united council shall decide upon this\nmatter?""This," said Morton, "we would not decline, if we could trust the hands\nin whom we are to leave the prisoner.--But you know well," he added,\nlooking sternly at Burley, "that you have already deceived me in this\nmatter.""Go to," said Burley, disdainfully,--"thou art an idle inconsiderate boy,\nwho, for the black eyebrows of a silly girl, would barter thy own faith\nand honour, and the cause of God and of thy country.""Mr Balfour," said Morton, laying his hand on his sword, "this language\nrequires satisfaction.""And thou shalt have it, stripling, when and where thou darest," said\nBurley; "I plight thee my good word on it."Poundtext, in his turn, interfered to remind them of the madness of\nquarrelling, and effected with difficulty a sort of sullen\nreconciliation."Concerning the prisoner," said Burley, "deal with him as ye think fit.I\nwash my hands free from all consequences.He is my prisoner, made by my\nsword and spear, while you, Mr Morton, were playing the adjutant at\ndrills and parades, and you, Mr Poundtext, were warping the Scriptures\ninto Erastianism.Take him unto you, nevertheless, and dispose of him as\nye think meet.--Dingwall," he continued, calling a sort of aid-de-camp,\nwho slept in the next apartment, "let the guard posted on the malignant\nEvandale give up their post to those whom Captain Morton shall appoint to\nrelieve them.--The prisoner," he said, again addressing Poundtext and\nMorton, "is now at your disposal, gentlemen.But remember, that for all\nthese things there will one day come a term of heavy accounting."So saying, he turned abruptly into an inner apartment, without bidding\nthem good evening.His two visitors, after a moment\'s consideration,\nagreed it would be prudent to ensure the prisoner\'s personal safety, by\nplacing over him an additional guard, chosen from their own parishioners.A band of them happened to be stationed in the hamlet, having been\nattached, for the time, to Burley\'s command, in order that the men might\nbe gratified by remaining as long as possible near to their own homes.They were, in general, smart, active young fellows, and were usually\ncalled by their companions, the Marksmen of Milnwood.By Morton\'s desire,\nfour of these lads readily undertook the task of sentinels, and he left\nwith them Headrigg, on whose fidelity he could depend, with instructions\nto call him, if any thing remarkable happened.This arrangement being made, Morton and his colleague took possession,\nfor the night, of such quarters as the over-crowded and miserable hamlet\ncould afford them.They did not, however, separate for repose till they\nhad drawn up a memorial of the grievances of the moderate presbyterians,\nwhich was summed up with a request of free toleration for their religion\nin future, and that they should be permitted to attend gospel ordinances\nas dispensed by their own clergymen, without oppression or molestation.Their petition proceeded to require that a free parliament should be\ncalled for settling the affairs of church and state, and for redressing\nthe injuries sustained by the subject; and that all those who either now\nwere, or had been, in arms, for obtaining these ends, should be\nindemnified.Morton could not but strongly hope that these terms, which\ncomprehended all that was wanted, or wished for, by the moderate party\namong the insurgents, might, when thus cleared of the violence of\nfanaticism, find advocates even among the royalists, as claiming only the\nordinary rights of Scottish freemen.He had the more confidence of a favourable reception, that the Duke of\nMonmouth, to whom Charles had intrusted the charge of subduing this\nrebellion, was a man of gentle, moderate, and accessible disposition,\nwell known to be favourable to the presbyterians, and invested by the\nking with full powers to take measures for quieting the disturbances in\nScotland.It seemed to Morton, that all that was necessary for\ninfluencing him in their favour was to find a fit and sufficiently\nrespectable channel of communication, and such seemed to be opened\nthrough the medium of Lord Evandale.He resolved, therefore, to visit the\nprisoner early in the morning, in order to sound his dispositions to\nundertake the task of mediator; but an accident happened which led him to\nanticipate his purpose.Gie ower your house, lady, he said,--\n                    Gie ower your house to me.Morton had finished the revisal and the making out of a fair copy of the\npaper on which he and Poundtext had agreed to rest as a full statement of\nthe grievances of their party, and the conditions on which the greater\npart of the insurgents would be contented to lay down their arms; and he\nwas about to betake himself to repose, when there was a knocking at the\ndoor of his apartment."Enter," said Morton; and the round bullethead of Cuddie Headrigg was\nthrust into the room."Come in," said Morton, "and tell me what you want."Na, stir; but I hae brought ane to speak wi\' you.""Ane o\' your auld acquaintance," said Cuddie; and, opening the door more\nfully, he half led, half dragged in a woman, whose face was muffled in\nher plaid.--"Come, come, ye needna be sae bashfu\' before auld\nacquaintance, Jenny," said Cuddie, pulling down the veil, and discovering\nto his master the well-remembered countenance of Jenny Dennison."Tell\nhis honour, now--there\'s a braw lass--tell him what ye were wanting to\nsay to Lord Evandale, mistress.""What was I wanting to say," answered Jenny, "to his honour himsell the\nother morning, when I visited him in captivity, ye muckle hash?--D\'ye\nthink that folk dinna want to see their friends in adversity, ye dour\ncrowdy-eater?"This reply was made with Jenny\'s usual volubility; but her voice\nquivered, her cheek was thin and pale, the tears stood in her eyes, her\nhand trembled, her manner was fluttered, and her whole presence bore\nmarks of recent suffering and privation, as well as nervous and\nhysterical agitation."You know how much I\nowe you in many respects, and can hardly make a request that I will not\ngrant, if in my power.""Many thanks, Milnwood," said the weeping damsel; "but ye were aye a kind\ngentleman, though folk say ye hae become sair changed now.""A\' body says," replied Jenny, "that you and the whigs hae made a vow to\nding King Charles aff the throne, and that neither he, nor his posteriors\nfrom generation to generation, shall sit upon it ony mair; and John\nGudyill threeps ye\'re to gie a\' the church organs to the pipers, and burn\nthe Book o\' Common-prayer by the hands of the common hangman, in revenge\nof the Covenant that was burnt when the king cam hame.""My friends at Tillietudlem judge too hastily and too ill of me,"\nanswered Morton."I wish to have free exercise of my own religion,\nwithout insulting any other; and as to your family, I only desire an\nopportunity to show them I have the same friendship and kindness as\never.""Bless your kind heart for saying sae," said Jenny, bursting into a flood\nof tears; "and they never needed kindness or friendship mair, for they\nare famished for lack o\' food."replied Morton, "I have heard of scarcity, but not of famine!It is possible?--Have the ladies and the Major"--\n\n"They hae suffered like the lave o\' us," replied Jenny; "for they shared\nevery bit and sup wi\' the whole folk in the Castle--I\'m sure my poor een\nsee fifty colours wi\' faintness, and my head\'s sae dizzy wi\' the\nmirligoes that I canna stand my lane."The thinness of the poor girl\'s cheek, and the sharpness of her features,\nbore witness to the truth of what she said."Sit down," he said, "for God\'s sake!"forcing her into the only chair\nthe apartment afforded, while he himself strode up and down the room in\nhorror and impatience."I knew not of this," he exclaimed in broken\nejaculations,--"I could not know of it.--Cold-blooded, iron-hearted\nfanatic--deceitful villain!--Cuddie, fetch refreshments--food--wine, if\npossible--whatever you can find.""Whisky is gude eneugh for her," muttered Cuddie; "ane wadna hae thought\nthat gude meal was sae scant amang them, when the quean threw sae muckle\ngude kail-brose scalding het about my lugs."Faint and miserable as Jenny seemed to be, she could not hear the\nallusion to her exploit during the storm of the Castle, without bursting\ninto a laugh which weakness soon converted into a hysterical giggle.Confounded at her state, and reflecting with horror on the distress which\nmust have been in the Castle, Morton repeated his commands to Headrigg in\na peremptory manner; and when he had departed, endeavoured to soothe his\nvisitor."You come, I suppose, by the orders of your mistress, to visit Lord\nEvandale?--Tell me what she desires; her orders shall be my law."Jenny appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, "Your honour is sae\nauld a friend, I must needs trust to you, and tell the truth.""Be assured, Jenny," said Morton, observing that she hesitated, "that you\nwill best serve your mistress by dealing sincerely with me.""Weel, then, ye maun ken we\'re starving, as I said before, and have been\nmair days than ane; and the Major has sworn that he expects relief daily,\nand that he will not gie ower the house to the enemy till we have eaten\nup his auld boots,--and they are unco thick in the soles, as ye may weel\nmind, forby being teugh in the upper-leather.The dragoons, again, they\nthink they will be forced to gie up at last, and they canna bide hunger\nweel, after the life they led at free quarters for this while bypast; and\nsince Lord Evandale\'s taen, there\'s nae guiding them; and Inglis says\nhe\'ll gie up the garrison to the whigs, and the Major and the leddies\ninto the bargain, if they will but let the troopers gang free themsells."said Morton; "why do they not make terms for all in the\nCastle?""They are fear\'d for denial o\' quarter to themsells, having dune sae\nmuckle mischief through the country; and Burley has hanged ane or twa o\'\nthem already--sae they want to draw their ain necks out o\' the collar at\nhazard o\' honest folk\'s.""And you were sent," continued Morton, "to carry to Lord Evandale the\nunpleasant news of the men\'s mutiny?""Just e\'en sae," said Jenny; "Tam Halliday took the rue, and tauld me a\'\nabout it, and gat me out o\' the Castle to tell Lord Evandale, if possibly\nI could win at him.""Well-a-day, ay," answered the afflicted damsel; "but maybe he could mak\nfair terms for us--or, maybe, he could gie us some good advice--or,\nmaybe, he might send his orders to the dragoons to be civil--or"--\n\n"Or, maybe," said Morton, "you were to try if it were possible to set him\nat liberty?""If it were sae," answered Jenny with spirit, "it wadna be the first time\nI hae done my best to serve a friend in captivity.""True, Jenny," replied Morton, "I were most ungrateful to forget it.But\nhere comes Cuddie with refreshments--I will go and do your errand to Lord\nEvandale, while you take some food and wine.""It willna be amiss ye should ken," said Cuddie to his master, "that this\nJenny--this Mrs Dennison, was trying to cuittle favour wi\' Tam Rand, the\nmiller\'s man, to win into Lord Evandale\'s room without ony body kennin\'.She wasna thinking, the gipsy, that I was at her elbow.""And an unco fright ye gae me when ye cam ahint and took a grip o\' me,"\nsaid Jenny, giving him a sly twitch with her finger and her thumb--"if ye\nhadna been an auld acquaintance, ye daft gomeril"--\n\nCuddie, somewhat relenting, grinned a smile on his artful mistress, while\nMorton wrapped himself up in his cloak, took his sword under his arm, and\nwent straight to the place of the young nobleman\'s confinement.He asked\nthe sentinels if any thing extraordinary had occurred."Nothing worth notice," they said, "excepting the lass that Cuddie took\nup, and two couriers that Captain Balfour had dispatched, one to the\nReverend Ephraim Macbriar, another to Kettledrummle," both of whom were\nbeating the drum ecclesiastic in different towns between the position of\nBurley and the head-quarters of the main army near Hamilton."The purpose, I presume," said Morton, with an affectation of\nindifference, "was to call them hither.""So I understand," answered the sentinel, who had spoke with the\nmessengers.He is summoning a triumphant majority of the council, thought Morton to\nhimself, for the purpose of sanctioning whatever action of atrocity he\nmay determine upon, and thwarting opposition by authority.I must be\nspeedy, or I shall lose my opportunity.When he entered the place of Lord Evandale\'s confinement, he found him\nironed, and reclining on a flock bed in the wretched garret of a\nmiserable cottage.He was either in a slumber, or in deep meditation,\nwhen Morton entered, and turned on him, when aroused, a countenance so\nmuch reduced by loss of blood, want of sleep, and scarcity of food, that\nno one could have recognised in it the gallant soldier who had behaved\nwith so much spirit at the skirmish of Loudon-hill.He displayed some\nsurprise at the sudden entrance of Morton."I am sorry to see you thus, my lord," said that youthful leader."I have heard you are an admirer of poetry," answered the prisoner; "in\nthat case, Mr Morton, you may remember these lines,--\n\n              \'Stone walls do not a prison make,\n               Or iron bars a cage;\n               A free and quiet mind can take\n               These for a hermitage.\'But, were my imprisonment less endurable, I am given to expect to-morrow\na total enfranchisement.""Surely," answered Lord Evandale; "I have no other prospect.Your\ncomrade, Burley, has already dipped his hand in the blood of men whose\nmeanness of rank and obscurity of extraction might have saved them.I\ncannot boast such a shield from his vengeance, and I expect to meet its\nextremity.""But Major Bellenden," said Morton, "may surrender, in order to preserve\nyour life.""Never, while there is one man to defend the battlement, and that man has\none crust to eat.I know his gallant resolution, and grieved should I be\nif he changed it for my sake."Morton hastened to acquaint him with the mutiny among the dragoons, and\ntheir resolution to surrender the Castle, and put the ladies of the\nfamily, as well as the Major, into the hands of the enemy.Lord Evandale\nseemed at first surprised, and something incredulous, but immediately\nafterwards deeply affected.he said--"How is this misfortune to be averted?""Hear me, my lord," said Morton."I believe you may not be unwilling to\nbear the olive branch between our master the King, and that part of his\nsubjects which is now in arms, not from choice, but necessity.""You construe me but justly," said Lord Evandale; "but to what does this\ntend?""Permit me, my lord"--continued Morton."I will set you at liberty upon\nparole; nay, you may return to the Castle, and shall have a safe conduct\nfor the ladies, the Major, and all who leave it, on condition of its\ninstant surrender.In contributing to bring this about you will only\nsubmit to circumstances; for, with a mutiny in the garrison, and without\nprovisions, it will be found impossible to defend the place twenty-four\nhours longer.Those, therefore, who refuse to accompany your lordship,\nmust take their fate.You and your followers shall have a free pass to\nEdinburgh, or where-ever the Duke of Monmouth may be.In return for your\nliberty, we hope that you will recommend to the notice of his Grace, as\nLieutenant-General of Scotland, this humble petition and remonstrance,\ncontaining the grievances which have occasioned this insurrection, a\nredress of which being granted, I will answer with my head, that the\ngreat body of the insurgents will lay down their arms."Lord Evandale read over the paper with attention."Mr Morton," he said, "in my simple judgment, I see little objection that\ncan be made to the measure here recommended; nay, farther, I believe, in\nmany respects, they may meet the private sentiments of the Duke of\nMonmouth: and yet, to deal frankly with you, I have no hopes of their\nbeing granted, unless, in the first place, you were to lay down your\narms.""The doing so," answered Morton, "would be virtually conceding that we\nhad no right to take them up; and that, for one, I will never agree to.""Perhaps it is hardly to be expected you should," said Lord Evandale;\n"and yet on that point I am certain the negotiations will be wrecked.I\nam willing, however, having frankly told you my opinion, to do all in my\npower to bring about a reconciliation.""It is all we can wish or expect," replied Morton; "the issue is in God\'s\nhands, who disposes the hearts of princes.--You accept, then, the safe\nconduct?""Certainly," answered Lord Evandale; "and if I do not enlarge upon the\nobligation incurred by your having saved my life a second time, believe\nthat I do not feel it the less.""And the garrison of Tillietudlem?""Shall be withdrawn as you propose," answered the young nobleman."I am\nsensible the Major will be unable to bring the mutineers to reason; and I\ntremble to think of the consequences, should the ladies and the brave old\nman be delivered up to this bloodthirsty ruffian, Burley.""You are in that case free," said Morton."Prepare to mount on horseback;\na few men whom I can trust shall attend you till you are in safety from\nour parties."Leaving Lord Evandale in great surprise and joy at this unexpected\ndeliverance, Morton hastened to get a few chosen men under arms and on\nhorseback, each rider holding the rein of a spare horse.Jenny, who,\nwhile she partook of her refreshment, had contrived to make up her breach\nwith Cuddie, rode on the left hand of that valiant cavalier.The tramp of\ntheir horses was soon heard under the window of Lord Evandale\'s prison.Two men, whom he did not know, entered the apartment, disencumbered him\nof his fetters, and, conducting him down stairs, mounted him in the\ncentre of the detachment.They set out at a round trot towards\nTillietudlem.The moonlight was giving way to the dawn when they approached that\nancient fortress, and its dark massive tower had just received the first\npale colouring of the morning.The party halted at the Tower barrier, not\nventuring to approach nearer for fear of the fire of the place.Lord\nEvandale alone rode up to the gate, followed at a distance by Jenny\nDennison.As they approached the gate, there was heard to arise in the\ncourt-yard a tumult, which accorded ill with the quiet serenity of a\nsummer dawn.Cries and oaths were heard, a pistol-shot or two were\ndischarged, and every thing announced that the mutiny had broken out.At\nthis crisis Lord Evandale arrived at the gate where Halliday was\nsentinel.On hearing Lord Evandale\'s voice, he instantly and gladly\nadmitted him, and that nobleman arrived among the mutinous troopers like\na man dropped from the clouds.They were in the act of putting their\ndesign into execution, of seizing the place into their own hands, and\nwere about to disarm and overpower Major Bellenden and Harrison, and\nothers of the Castle, who were offering the best resistance in their\npower.The appearance of Lord Evandale changed the scene.He seized Inglis by\nthe collar, and, upbraiding him with his villainy, ordered two of his\ncomrades to seize and bind him, assuring the others, that their only\nchance of impunity consisted in instant submission.He then ordered the\nmen into their ranks.They hesitated; but the instinct of discipline, joined to their\npersuasion that the authority of their officer, so boldly exerted, must\nbe supported by some forces without the gate, induced them to submit."Take away those arms," said Lord Evandale to the people of the Castle;\n"they shall not be restored until these men know better the use for which\nthey are intrusted with them.--And now," he continued, addressing the\nmutineers, "begone!--Make the best use of your time, and of a truce of\nthree hours, which the enemy are contented to allow you.Take the road to\nEdinburgh, and meet me at the House-of-Muir.I need not bid you beware of\ncommitting violence by the way; you will not, in your present condition,\nprovoke resentment for your own sakes.Let your punctuality show that you\nmean to atone for this morning\'s business."The disarmed soldiers shrunk in silence from the presence of their\nofficer, and, leaving the Castle, took the road to the place of\nrendezvous, making such haste as was inspired by the fear of meeting with\nsome detached party of the insurgents, whom their present defenceless\ncondition, and their former violence, might inspire with thoughts of\nrevenge.Inglis, whom Evandale destined for punishment, remained in\ncustody.Halliday was praised for his conduct, and assured of succeeding\nto the rank of the culprit.These arrangements being hastily made, Lord\nEvandale accosted the Major, before whose eyes the scene had seemed to\npass like the change of a dream."My dear Major, we must give up the place.""I was in hopes you had brought\nreinforcements and supplies.""Not a man--not a pound of meal," answered Lord Evandale."Yet I am blithe to see you," returned the honest Major; "we were\ninformed yesterday that these psalm-singing rascals had a plot on your\nlife, and I had mustered the scoundrelly dragoons ten minutes ago in\norder to beat up Burley\'s quarters and get you out of limbo, when the dog\nInglis, instead of obeying me, broke out into open mutiny.--But what is\nto be done now?""I have, myself, no choice," said Lord Evandale; "I am a prisoner,\nreleased on parole, and bound for Edinburgh.You and the ladies must take\nthe same route.I have, by the favour of a friend, a safe conduct and\nhorses for you and your retinue--for God\'s sake make haste--you cannot\npropose to hold out with seven or eight men, and without provisions--\nEnough has been done for honour, and enough to render the defence of the\nhighest consequence to government.More were needless, as well as\ndesperate.The English troops are arrived at Edinburgh, and will speedily\nmove upon Hamilton.The possession of Tillietudlem by the rebels will be\nbut temporary.""If you think so, my lord," said the veteran, with a reluctant sigh,--"I\nknow you only advise what is honourable--if, then, you really think the\ncase inevitable, I must submit; for the mutiny of these scoundrels would\nrender it impossible to man the walls.--Gudyill, let the women call up\ntheir mistresses, and all be ready to march--But if I could believe that\nmy remaining in these old walls, till I was starved to a mummy, could do\nthe King\'s cause the least service, old Miles Bellenden would not leave\nthem while there was a spark of life in his body!"The ladies, already alarmed by the mutiny, now heard the determination of\nthe Major, in which they readily acquiesced, though not without some\ngroans and sighs on the part of Lady Margaret, which referred, as usual,\nto the _dejeune_; of his Most Sacred Majesty in the halls which were now\nto be abandoned to rebels.Hasty preparations were made for evacuating\nthe Castle; and long ere the dawn was distinct enough for discovering\nobjects with precision, the ladies, with Major Bellenden, Harrison,\nGudyill, and the other domestics, were mounted on the led horses, and\nothers which had been provided in the neighbourhood, and proceeded\ntowards the north, still escorted by four of the insurgent horsemen.The\nrest of the party who had accompanied Lord Evandale from the hamlet, took\npossession of the deserted Castle, carefully forbearing all outrage or\nacts of plunder.And when the sun arose, the scarlet and blue colours of\nthe Scottish Covenant floated from the Keep of Tillietudlem.And, to my breast, a bodkin in her hand\n               Were worth a thousand daggers.The cavalcade which left the Castle of Tillietudlem, halted for a few\nminutes at the small town of Bothwell, after passing the outposts of the\ninsurgents, to take some slight refreshments which their attendants had\nprovided, and which were really necessary to persons who had suffered\nconsiderably by want of proper nourishment.They then pressed forward\nupon the road towards Edinburgh, amid the lights of dawn which were now\nrising on the horizon.It might have been expected, during the course of\nthe journey, that Lord Evandale would have been frequently by the side of\nMiss Edith Bellenden.Yet, after his first salutations had been\nexchanged, and every precaution solicitously adopted which could serve\nfor her accommodation, he rode in the van of the party with Major\nBellenden, and seemed to abandon the charge of immediate attendance upon\nhis lovely niece to one of the insurgent cavaliers, whose dark military\ncloak, with the large flapped hat and feather, which drooped over his\nface, concealed at once his figure and his features.They rode side by\nside in silence for more than two miles, when the stranger addressed Miss\nBellenden in a tremulous and suppressed voice."Miss Bellenden," he said, "must have friends wherever she is known; even\namong those whose conduct she now disapproves.Is there any thing that\nsuch can do to show their respect for her, and their regret for her\nsufferings?""Let them learn for their own sakes," replied Edith, "to venerate the\nlaws, and to spare innocent blood.Let them return to their allegiance,\nand I can forgive them all that I have suffered, were it ten times more.""You think it impossible, then," rejoined the cavalier, "for any one to\nserve in our ranks, having the weal of his country sincerely at heart,\nand conceiving himself in the discharge of a patriotic duty?""It might be imprudent, while so absolutely in your power," replied Miss\nBellenden, "to answer that question.""Not in the present instance, I plight you the word of a soldier,"\nreplied the horseman."I have been taught candour from my birth," said Edith; "and, if I am to\nspeak at all, I must utter my real sentiments.God only can judge the\nheart--men must estimate intentions by actions.Treason, murder by the\nsword and by gibbet, the oppression of a private family such as ours, who\nwere only in arms for the defence of the established government, and of\nour own property, are actions which must needs sully all that have\naccession to them, by whatever specious terms they may be gilded over.""The guilt of civil war," rejoined the horseman--"the miseries which it\nbrings in its train, lie at the door of those who provoked it by illegal\noppression, rather than of such as are driven to arms in order to assert\ntheir natural rights as freemen.""That is assuming the question," replied Edith, "which ought to be\nproved.Each party contends that they are right in point of principle,\nand therefore the guilt must lie with them who first drew the sword; as,\nin an affray, law holds those to be the criminals who are the first to\nhave recourse to violence."said the horseman, "were our vindication to rest there, how easy\nwould it be to show that we have suffered with a patience which almost\nseemed beyond the power of humanity, ere we were driven by oppression\ninto open resistance!--But I perceive," he continued, sighing deeply,\n"that it is vain to plead before Miss Bellenden a cause which she has\nalready prejudged, perhaps as much from her dislike of the persons as of\nthe principles of those engaged in it.""Pardon me," answered Edith; "I have stated with freedom my opinion\nof the principles of the insurgents; of their persons I know\nnothing--excepting in one solitary instance.""And that instance," said the horseman, "has influenced your opinion of\nthe whole body?""Far from it," said Edith; "he is--at least I once thought him--one in\nwhose scale few were fit to be weighed--he is--or he seemed--one of early\ntalent, high faith, pure morality, and warm affections.Can I approve of\na rebellion which has made such a man, formed to ornament, to enlighten,\nand to defend his country, the companion of gloomy and ignorant fanatics,\nor canting hypocrites,--the leader of brutal clowns,--the brother-in-arms\nto banditti and highway murderers?--Should you meet such an one in your\ncamp, tell him that Edith Bellenden has wept more over his fallen\ncharacter, blighted prospects, and dishonoured name, than over the\ndistresses of her own house,--and that she has better endured that famine\nwhich has wasted her cheek and dimmed her eye, than the pang of heart\nwhich attended the reflection by and through whom these calamities were\ninflicted."As she thus spoke, she turned upon her companion a countenance, whose\nfaded cheek attested the reality of her sufferings, even while it glowed\nwith the temporary animation which accompanied her language.The horseman\nwas not insensible to the appeal; he raised his hand to his brow with the\nsudden motion of one who feels a pang shoot along his brain, passed it\nhastily over his face, and then pulled the shadowing hat still deeper on\nhis forehead.The movement, and the feelings which it excited, did not\nescape Edith, nor did she remark them without emotion."And yet," she said, "should the person of whom I speak seem to you too\ndeeply affected by the hard opinion of--of--an early friend, say to him,\nthat sincere repentance is next to innocence;--that, though fallen from a\nheight not easily recovered, and the author of much mischief, because\ngilded by his example, he may still atone in some measure for the evil he\nhas done."asked the cavalier, in the same suppressed, and\nalmost choked voice."By lending his efforts to restore the blessings of peace to his\ndistracted countrymen, and to induce the deluded rebels to lay down their\narms.By saving their blood, he may atone for that which has been already\nspilt;--and he that shall be most active in accomplishing this great end,\nwill best deserve the thanks of this age, and an honoured remembrance in\nthe next.""And in such a peace," said her companion, with a firm voice, "Miss\nBellenden would not wish, I think, that the interests of the people were\nsacrificed unreservedly to those of the crown?""I am but a girl," was the young lady\'s reply; "and I scarce can speak on\nthe subject without presumption.But, since I have gone so far, I will\nfairly add, I would wish to see a peace which should give rest to all\nparties, and secure the subjects from military rapine, which I detest as\nmuch as I do the means now adopted to resist it.""Miss Bellenden," answered Henry Morton, raising his face, and speaking\nin his natural tone, "the person who has lost such a highly-valued place\nin your esteem, has yet too much spirit to plead his cause as a criminal;\nand, conscious that he can no longer claim a friend\'s interest in your\nbosom, he would be silent under your hard censure, were it not that he\ncan refer to the honoured testimony of Lord Evandale, that his earnest\nwishes and most active exertions are, even now, directed to the\naccomplishment of such a peace as the most loyal cannot censure."He bowed with dignity to Miss Bellenden, who, though her language\nintimated that she well knew to whom she had been speaking, probably had\nnot expected that he would justify himself with so much animation.She\nreturned his salute, confused and in silence.Morton then rode forward to\nthe head of the party.exclaimed Major Bellenden, surprised at the sudden\napparition."The same," answered Morton; "who is sorry that he labours under the\nharsh construction of Major Bellenden and his family.He commits to my\nLord Evandale," he continued, turning towards the young nobleman, and\nbowing to him, "the charge of undeceiving his friends, both regarding the\nparticulars of his conduct and the purity of his motives.Farewell, Major\nBellenden--All happiness attend you and yours--May we meet again in\nhappier and better times!""Believe me," said Lord Evandale, "your confidence, Mr Morton, is not\nmisplaced; I will endeavour to repay the great services I have received\nfrom you by doing my best to place your character on its proper footing\nwith Major Bellenden, and all whose esteem you value.""I expected no less from your generosity, my lord," said Morton.He then called his followers, and rode off along the heath in the\ndirection of Hamilton, their feathers waving and their steel caps\nglancing in the beams of the rising sun.Cuddie Headrigg alone remained\nan instant behind his companions to take an affectionate farewell of\nJenny Dennison, who had contrived, during this short morning\'s ride, to\nre-establish her influence over his susceptible bosom.A straggling tree\nor two obscured, rather than concealed, their _tete-a-tete_, as they\nhalted their horses to bid adieu."Fare ye weel, Jenny," said Cuddie, with a loud exertion of his lungs,\nintended perhaps to be a sigh, but rather resembling the intonation of a\ngroan,--"Ye\'ll think o\' puir Cuddie sometimes--an honest lad that lo\'es\nye, Jenny; ye\'ll think o\' him now and then?""Whiles--at brose-time," answered the malicious damsel, unable either to\nsuppress the repartee, or the arch smile which attended it.[Illustration: Whiles--at Brose-Time--pa098]\n\n\nCuddie took his revenge as rustic lovers are wont, and as Jenny probably\nexpected,--caught his mistress round the neck, kissed her cheeks and lips\nheartily, and then turned his horse and trotted after his master."Deil\'s in the fallow," said Jenny, wiping her lips and adjusting her\nhead-dress, "he has twice the spunk o\' Tam Halliday, after a\'.--Coming,\nmy leddy, coming--Lord have a care o\' us, I trust the auld leddy didna\nsee us!""Jenny," said Lady Margaret, as the damsel came up, "was not that young\nman who commanded the party the same that was captain of the popinjay,\nand who was afterwards prisoner at Tillietudlem on the morning\nClaverhouse came there?"Jenny, happy that the query had no reference to her own little matters,\nlooked at her young mistress, to discover, if possible, whether it was\nher cue to speak truth or not.Not being able to catch any hint to guide\nher, she followed her instinct as a lady\'s maid, and lied."I dinna believe it was him, my leddy," said Jenny, as confidently as if\nshe had been saying her catechism; "he was a little black man, that.""You must have been blind, Jenny," said the Major: "Henry Morton is tall\nand fair, and that youth is the very man.""I had ither thing ado than be looking at him," said Jenny, tossing her\nhead; "he may be as fair as a farthing candle, for me.""Is it not," said Lady Margaret, "a blessed escape which we have made,\nout of the hands of so desperate and bloodthirsty a fanatic?""You are deceived, madam," said Lord Evandale; "Mr Morton merits such a\ntitle from no one, but least from us.That I am now alive, and that you\nare now on your safe retreat to your friends, instead of being prisoners\nto a real fanatical homicide, is solely and entirely owing to the prompt,\nactive, and energetic humanity of this young gentleman."He then went into a particular narrative of the events with which the\nreader is acquainted, dwelling upon the merits of Morton, and expatiating\non the risk at which he had rendered them these important services, as if\nhe had been a brother instead of a rival."I were worse than ungrateful," he said, "were I silent on the merits of\nthe man who has twice saved my life.""I would willingly think well of Henry Morton, my lord," replied Major\nBellenden; "and I own he has behaved handsomely to your lordship and to\nus; but I cannot have the same allowances which it pleases your lordship\nto entertain for his present courses.""You are to consider," replied Lord Evandale, "that he has been partly\nforced upon them by necessity; and I must add, that his principles,\nthough differing in some degree from my own, are such as ought to command\nrespect.Claverhouse, whose knowledge of men is not to be disputed, spoke\njustly of him as to his extraordinary qualities, but with prejudice, and\nharshly, concerning his principles and motives.""You have not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities, my\nlord," answered Major Bellenden."I, who have known him from boyhood,\ncould, before this affair, have said much of his good principles and\ngood-nature; but as to his high talents"--\n\n"They were probably hidden, Major," replied the generous Lord Evandale,\n"even from himself, until circumstances called them forth; and, if I have\ndetected them, it was only because our intercourse and conversation\nturned on momentous and important subjects.He is now labouring to bring\nthis rebellion to an end, and the terms he has proposed are so moderate,\nthat they shall not want my hearty recommendation.""And have you hopes," said Lady Margaret, "to accomplish a scheme so\ncomprehensive?""I should have, madam, were every whig as moderate as Morton, and every\nloyalist as disinterested as Major Bellenden.But such is the fanaticism\nand violent irritation of both parties, that I fear nothing will end this\ncivil war save the edge of the sword."It may be readily supposed, that Edith listened with the deepest interest\nto this conversation.While she regretted that she had expressed herself\nharshly and hastily to her lover, she felt a conscious and proud\nsatisfaction that his character was, even in the judgment of his\nnoble-minded rival, such as her own affection had once spoke it."Civil feuds and domestic prejudices," she said, "may render it necessary\nfor me to tear his remembrance from my heart; but it is not small relief\nto know assuredly, that it is worthy of the place it has so long retained\nthere."While Edith was thus retracting her unjust resentment, her lover arrived\nat the camp of the insurgents, near Hamilton, which he found in\nconsiderable confusion.Certain advices had arrived that the royal army,\nhaving been recruited from England by a large detachment of the King\'s\nGuards, were about to take the field.Fame magnified their numbers and\ntheir high state of equipment and discipline, and spread abroad other\ncircumstances, which dismayed the courage of the insurgents.What favour\nthey might have expected from Monmouth, was likely to be intercepted by\nthe influence of those associated with him in command.His\nlieutenant-general was the celebrated General Thomas Dalzell, who, having\npractised the art of war in the then barbarous country of Russia, was as\nmuch feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human\nsufferings, as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour.This man was second in command to Monmouth, and the horse were commanded\nby Claverhouse, burning with desire to revenge the death of his nephew,\nand his defeat at Drumclog.To these accounts was added the most\nformidable and terrific description of the train of artillery and the\ncavalry force with which the royal army took the field.[Note:  Royal Army at Bothwell Bridge.A Cameronian muse was\n     awakened from slumber on this doleful occasion, and gave the\n     following account of the muster of the royal forces, in poetry\n     nearly as melancholy as the subject:--\n\n                    They marched east through Lithgow-town\n                    For to enlarge their forces;\n                    And sent for all the north-country\n                    To come, both foot and horses.Montrose did come and Athole both,\n                    And with them many more;\n                    And all the Highland Amorites\n                    That had been there before.The Lowdien Mallisha--Lothian Militia they\n                    Came with their coats of blew;\n                    Five hundred men from London came,\n                    Claid in a reddish hue.When they were assembled one and all,\n                    A full brigade were they;\n                    Like to a pack of hellish hounds,\n                    Roreing after their prey.When they were all provided well,\n                    In armour and amonition,\n                    Then thither wester did they come,\n                    Most cruel of intention.The royalists celebrated their victory in stanzas of equal merit.Specimens of both may be found in the curious collection of Fugitive\n     Scottish Poetry, principally of the Seventeenth Century, printed for\n     the Messrs Laing, Edinburgh.]Large bodies, composed of the Highland clans, having in language,\nreligion, and manners, no connexion with the insurgents, had been\nsummoned to join the royal army under their various chieftains; and these\nAmorites, or Philistines, as the insurgents termed them, came like eagles\nto the slaughter.In fact, every person who could ride or run at the\nKing\'s command, was summoned to arms, apparently with the purpose of\nforfeiting and fining such men of property whom their principles might\ndeter from joining the royal standard, though prudence prevented them\nfrom joining that of the insurgent Presbyterians.In short, everyrumour\ntended to increase the apprehension among the insurgents, that the King\'s\nvengeance had only been delayed in order that it might fall more certain\nand more heavy.Morton endeavoured to fortify the minds of the common people by pointing\nout the probable exaggeration of these reports, and by reminding them of\nthe strength of their own situation, with an unfordable river in front,\nonly passable by a long and narrow bridge.He called to their remembrance\ntheir victory over Claverhouse when their numbers were few, and then much\nworse disciplined and appointed for battle than now; showed them that the\nground on which they lay afforded, by its undulation, and the thickets\nwhich intersected it, considerable protection against artillery, and even\nagainst cavalry, if stoutly defended; and that their safety, in fact,\ndepended on their own spirit and resolution.But while Morton thus endeavoured to keep up the courage of the army at\nlarge, he availed himself of those discouraging rumours to endeavour to\nimpress on the minds of the leaders the necessity of proposing to the\ngovernment moderate terms of accommodation, while they were still\nformidable as commanding an unbroken and numerous army.He pointed out to\nthem, that, in the present humour of their followers, it could hardly be\nexpected that they would engage, with advantage, the well-appointed and\nregular force of the Duke of Monmouth; and that if they chanced, as was\nmost likely, to be defeated and dispersed, the insurrection in which they\nhad engaged, so far from being useful to the country, would be rendered\nthe apology for oppressing it more severely.Pressed by these arguments, and feeling it equally dangerous to remain\ntogether, or to dismiss their forces, most of the leaders readily agreed,\nthat if such terms could be obtained as had been transmitted to the Duke\nof Monmouth by the hands of Lord Evandale, the purpose for which they had\ntaken up arms would be, in a great measure, accomplished.They then\nentered into similar resolutions, and agreed to guarantee the petition\nand remonstrance which had been drawn up by Morton.On the contrary,\nthere were still several leaders, and those men whose influence with the\npeople exceeded that of persons of more apparent consequence, who\nregarded every proposal of treaty which did not proceed on the basis of\nthe Solemn League and Covenant of 1640, as utterly null and void,\nimpious, and unchristian.These men diffused their feelings among the\nmultitude, who had little foresight, and nothing to lose, and persuaded\nmany that the timid counsellors who recommended peace upon terms short of\nthe dethronement of the royal family, and the declared independence of\nthe church with respect to the state, were cowardly labourers, who were\nabout to withdraw their hands from the plough, and despicable trimmers,\nwho sought only a specious pretext for deserting their brethren in arms.These contradictory opinions were fiercely argued in each tent of the\ninsurgent army, or rather in the huts or cabins which served in the place\nof tents.Violence in language often led to open quarrels and blows, and\nthe divisions into which the army of sufferers was rent served as too\nplain a presage of their future fate.The curse of growing factions and divisions\n               Still vex your councils!The prudence of Morton found sufficient occupation in stemming the\nfurious current of these contending parties, when, two days after his\nreturn to Hamilton, he was visited by his friend and colleague, the\nReverend Mr Poundtext, flying, as he presently found, from the face of\nJohn Balfour of Burley, whom he left not a little incensed at the share\nhe had taken in the liberation of Lord Evandale.When the worthy divine\nhad somewhat recruited his spirits, after the hurry and fatigue of his\njourney, he proceeded to give Morton an account of what had passed in the\nvicinity of Tillietudlem after the memorable morning of his departure.The night march of Morton had been accomplished with such dexterity,\nand the men were so faithful to their trust, that Burley received no\nintelligence of what had happened until the morning was far advanced.His first enquiry was, whether Macbriar and Kettledrummle had arrived,\nagreeably to the summons which he had dispatched at midnight.Macbriar\nhad come, and Kettledrummle, though a heavy traveller, might, he was\ninformed, be instantly expected.Burley then dispatched a messenger to\nMorton\'s quarters to summon him to an immediate council.The messenger\nreturned with news that he had left the place.Poundtext was next\nsummoned; but he thinking, as he said himself, that it was ill dealing\nwith fractious folk, had withdrawn to his own quiet manse, preferring a\ndark ride, though he had been on horseback the whole preceding day, to a\nrenewal in the morning of a controversy with Burley, whose ferocity\noverawed him when unsupported by the firmness of Morton.Burley\'s next\nenquiries were directed after Lord Evandale; and great was his rage when\nhe learned that he had been conveyed away over night by a party of the\nmarksmen of Milnwood, under the immediate command of Henry Morton\nhimself.exclaimed Burley, addressing himself to Macbriar; "the\nbase, mean-spirited traitor, to curry favour for himself with the\ngovernment, hath set at liberty the prisoner taken by my own right hand,\nthrough means of whom, I have little doubt, the possession of the place\nof strength which hath wrought us such trouble, might now have been in\nour hands!"said Macbriar, looking up towards the Keep\nof the Castle; "and are not these the colours of the Covenant that float\nover its walls?""A stratagem--a mere trick," said Burley, "an insult over our\ndisappointment, intended to aggravate and embitter our spirits."He was interrupted by the arrival of one of Morton\'s followers, sent to\nreport to him the evacuation of the place, and its occupation by the\ninsurgent forces.Burley was rather driven to fury than reconciled by the\nnews of this success."I have watched," he said--"I have fought--I have plotted--I have striven\nfor the reduction of this place--I have forborne to seek to head\nenterprises of higher command and of higher honour--I have narrowed their\noutgoings, and cut off the springs, and broken the staff of bread within\ntheir walls; and when the men were about to yield themselves to my hand,\nthat their sons might be bondsmen, and their daughters a laughing-stock\nto our whole camp, cometh this youth, without a beard on his chin, and\ntakes it on him to thrust his sickle into the harvest, and to rend the\nprey from the spoiler!Surely the labourer is worthy of his hire, and the\ncity, with its captives, should be given to him that wins it?""Nay," said Macbriar, who was surprised at the degree of agitation which\nBalfour displayed, "chafe not thyself because of the ungodly.Heaven will\nuse its own instruments; and who knows but this youth"--\n\n"Hush!said Burley; "do not discredit thine own better judgment.It was thou that first badest me beware of this painted sepulchre--this\nlacquered piece of copper, that passed current with me for gold.It fares\nill, even with the elect, when they neglect the guidance of such pious\npastors as thou.But our carnal affections will mislead us--this\nungrateful boy\'s father was mine ancient friend.They must be as earnest\nin their struggles as thou, Ephraim Macbriar, that would shake themselves\nclear of the clogs and chains of humanity."This compliment touched the preacher in the most sensible part; and\nBurley deemed, therefore, he should find little difficulty in moulding\nhis opinions to the support of his own views, more especially as they\nagreed exactly in their high-strained opinions of church government."Let us instantly," he said, "go up to the Tower; there is that among the\nrecords in yonder fortress, which, well used as I can use it, shall be\nworth to us a valiant leader and an hundred horsemen.""But will such be the fitting aids of the children of the Covenant?""We have already among us too many who hunger after lands,\nand silver and gold, rather than after the Word; it is not by such that\nour deliverance shall be wrought out.""Thou errest," said Burley; "we must work by means, and these worldly men\nshall be our instruments.At all events, the Moabitish woman shall be\ndespoiled of her inheritance, and neither the malignant Evandale, nor the\nerastian Morton, shall possess yonder castle and lands, though they may\nseek in marriage the daughter thereof."So saying, he led the way to Tillietudlem, where he seized upon the plate\nand other valuables for the use of the army, ransacked the charter-room,\nand other receptacles for family papers, and treated with contempt the\nremonstrances of those who reminded him, that the terms granted to the\ngarrison had guaranteed respect to private property.Burley and Macbriar, having established themselves in their new\nacquisition, were joined by Kettledrummle in the course of the day, and\nalso by the Laird of Langcale, whom that active divine had contrived to\nseduce, as Poundtext termed it, from the pure light in which he had been\nbrought up.Thus united, they sent to the said Poundtext an invitation,\nor rather a summons, to attend a council at Tillietudlem.He remembered,\nhowever, that the door had an iron grate, and the Keep a dungeon, and\nresolved not to trust himself with his incensed colleagues.He therefore\nretreated, or rather fled, to Hamilton, with the tidings, that Burley,\nMacbriar, and Kettledrummle, were coming to Hamilton as soon as they\ncould collect a body of Cameronians sufficient to overawe the rest of the\narmy."And ye see," concluded Poundtext, with a deep sigh, "that they will then\npossess a majority in the council; for Langcale, though he has always\npassed for one of the honest and rational party, cannot be suitably or\npreceesely termed either fish, or flesh, or gude red-herring--whoever has\nthe stronger party has Langcale."Thus concluded the heavy narrative of honest Poundtext, who sighed\ndeeply, as he considered the danger in which he was placed betwixt\nunreasonable adversaries amongst themselves and the common enemy from\nwithout.Morton exhorted him to patience, temper, and composure; informed\nhim of the good hope he had of negotiating for peace and indemnity\nthrough means of Lord Evandale, and made out to him a very fair prospect\nthat he should again return to his own parchment-bound Calvin, his\nevening pipe of tobacco, and his noggin of inspiring ale, providing\nalways he would afford his effectual support and concurrence to the\nmeasures which he, Morton, had taken for a general pacification.The author does not, by any means,\n     desire that Poundtext should be regarded as a just representation of\n     the moderate presbyterians, among whom were many ministers whose\n     courage was equal to their good sense and sound views of religion.Were he to write the tale anew, he would probably endeavour to give\n     the character a higher turn.It is certain, however, that the\n     Cameronians imputed to their opponents in opinion concerning the\n     Indulgence, or others of their strained and fanatical notions, a\n     disposition not only to seek their own safety, but to enjoy\n     themselves.Hamilton speaks of three clergymen of this description\n     as follows:--\n\n     "They pretended great zeal against the Indulgence; but alas!that\n     was all their practice, otherwise being but very gross, which I\n     shall but hint at in short.When great Cameron and those with him\n     were taking many a cold blast and storm in the fields and among the\n     cot-houses in Scotland, these three had for the most part their\n     residence in Glasgow, where they found good quarter and a full\n     table, which I doubt not but some bestowed upon them from real\n     affection to the Lord\'s cause; and when these three were together,\n     their greatest work was who should make the finest and sharpest\n     roundel, and breathe the quickest jests upon one another, and to\n     tell what valiant acts they were to do, and who could laugh loudest\n     and most heartily among them; and when at any time they came out to\n     the country, whatever other things they had, they were careful each\n     of them to have a great flask of brandy with them, which was very\n     heavy to some, particularly to Mr Cameron, Mr Cargill, and Henry\n     Hall--I shall name no more."Thus backed and comforted, Poundtext resolved magnanimously to await the\ncoming of the Cameronians to the general rendezvous.Burley and his confederates had drawn together a considerable body of\nthese sectaries, amounting to a hundred horse and about fifteen hundred\nfoot, clouded and severe in aspect, morose and jealous in communication,\nhaughty of heart, and confident, as men who believed that the pale of\nsalvation was open for them exclusively; while all other Christians,\nhowever slight were the shades of difference of doctrine from their own,\nwere in fact little better than outcasts or reprobates.These men entered\nthe presbyterian camp, rather as dubious and suspicious allies, or\npossibly antagonists, than as men who were heartily embarked in the same\ncause, and exposed to the same dangers, with their more moderate brethren\nin arms.Burley made no private visits to his colleagues, and held no\ncommunication with them on the subject of the public affairs, otherwise\nthan by sending a dry invitation to them to attend a meeting of the\ngeneral council for that evening.On the arrival of Morton and Poundtext at the place of assembly, they\nfound their brethren already seated.Slight greeting passed between them,\nand it was easy to see that no amicable conference was intended by those\nwho convoked the council.The first question was put by Macbriar, the\nsharp eagerness of whose zeal urged him to the van on all occasions.He\ndesired to know by whose authority the malignant, called Lord Evandale,\nhad been freed from the doom of death, justly denounced against him."By my authority and Mr Morton\'s," replied Poundtext; who, besides being\nanxious to give his companion a good opinion of his courage, confided\nheartily in his support, and, moreover, had much less fear of\nencountering one of his own profession, and who confined himself to the\nweapons of theological controversy, in which Poundtext feared no man,\nthan of entering into debate with the stern homicide Balfour."And who, brother," said Kettledrummle, "who gave you authority to\ninterpose in such a high matter?""The tenor of our commission," answered Poundtext, "gives us authority to\nbind and to loose.If Lord Evandale was justly doomed to die by the voice\nof one of our number, he was of a surety lawfully redeemed from death by\nthe warrant of two of us.""Go to, go to," said Burley; "we know your motives; it was to send that\nsilkworm--that gilded trinket--that embroidered trifle of a lord, to bear\nterms of peace to the tyrant.""It was so," replied Morton, who saw his companion begin to flinch before\nthe fierce eye of Balfour--"it was so; and what then?--Are we to plunge\nthe nation in endless war, in order to pursue schemes which are equally\nwild, wicked, and unattainable?"said Balfour; "he blasphemeth.""It is false," said Morton; "they blaspheme who pretend to expect\nmiracles, and neglect the use of the human means with which Providence\nhas blessed them.I repeat it--Our avowed object is the re-establishment\nof peace on fair and honourable terms of security to our religion and our\nliberty.We disclaim any desire to tyrannize over those of others."The debate would now have run higher than ever, but they were interrupted\nby intelligence that the Duke of Monmouth had commenced his march towards\nthe west, and was already advanced half way from Edinburgh.This news\nsilenced their divisions for the moment, and it was agreed that the next\nday should be held as a fast of general humiliation for the sins of the\nland; that the Reverend Mr Poundtext should preach to the army in the\nmorning, and Kettledrummle in the afternoon; that neither should touch\nupon any topics of schism or of division, but animate the soldiers to\nresist to the blood, like brethren in a good cause.This healing overture\nhaving been agreed to, the moderate party ventured upon another proposal,\nconfiding that it would have the support of Langcale, who looked\nextremely blank at the news which they had just received, and might be\nsupposed reconverted to moderate measures.It was to be presumed, they\nsaid, that since the King had not intrusted the command of his forces\nupon the present occasion to any of their active oppressors, but, on the\ncontrary, had employed a nobleman distinguished by gentleness of temper,\nand a disposition favourable to their cause, there must be some better\nintention entertained towards them than they had yet experienced.They\ncontended, that it was not only prudent but necessary to ascertain, from\na communication with the Duke of Monmouth, whether he was not charged\nwith some secret instructions in their favour.This could only be learned\nby dispatching an envoy to his army.said Burley, evading a proposal too\nreasonable to be openly resisted--"Who will go up to their camp, knowing\nthat John Grahame of Claverhouse hath sworn to hang up whomsoever we\nshall dispatch towards them, in revenge of the death of the young man his\nnephew?""Let that be no obstacle," said Morton; "I will with pleasure encounter\nany risk attached to the bearer of your errand.""Let him go," said Balfour, apart to Macbriar; "our councils will be well\nrid of his presence."The motion, therefore, received no contradiction even from those who were\nexpected to have been most active in opposing it; and it was agreed that\nHenry Morton should go to the camp of the Duke of Monmouth, in order to\ndiscover upon what terms the insurgents would be admitted to treat with\nhim.As soon as his errand was made known, several of the more moderate\nparty joined in requesting him to make terms upon the footing of the\npetition intrusted to Lord Evandale\'s hands; for the approach of the\nKing\'s army spread a general trepidation, by no means allayed by the high\ntone assumed by the Cameronians, which had so little to support it,\nexcepting their own headlong zeal.With these instructions, and with\nCuddie as his attendant, Morton set forth towards the royal camp, at all\nthe risks which attend those who assume the office of mediator during the\nheat of civil discord.Morton had not proceeded six or seven miles, before he perceived that he\nwas on the point of falling in with the van of the royal forces; and, as\nhe ascended a height, saw all the roads in the neighbourhood occupied by\narmed men marching in great order towards Bothwell-muir, an open common,\non which they proposed to encamp for that evening, at the distance of\nscarcely two miles from the Clyde, on the farther side of which river the\narmy of the insurgents was encamped.He gave himself up to the first\nadvanced-guard of cavalry which he met, as bearer of a flag of truce, and\ncommunicated his desire to obtain access to the Duke of Monmouth.The\nnon-commissioned officer who commanded the party made his report to his\nsuperior, and he again to another in still higher command, and both\nimmediately rode to the spot where Morton was detained."You are but losing your time, my friend, and risking your life," said\none of them, addressing Morton; "the Duke of Monmouth will receive no\nterms from traitors with arms in their hands, and your cruelties have\nbeen such as to authorize retaliation of every kind.Better trot your nag\nback and save his mettle to-day, that he may save your life to-morrow.""I cannot think," said Morton, "that even if the Duke of Monmouth should\nconsider us as criminals, he would condemn so large a body of his\nfellow-subjects without even hearing what they have to plead for\nthemselves.I am conscious of having consented\nto, or authorized, no cruelty, and the fear of suffering innocently for\nthe crimes of others shall not deter me from executing my commission.""I have an idea," said the younger, "that this is the young man of whom\nLord Evandale spoke.""Is my Lord Evandale in the army?""He is not," replied the officer; "we left him at Edinburgh, too much\nindisposed to take the field.--Your name, sir, I presume, is Henry\nMorton?""We will not oppose your seeing the Duke, sir," said the officer, with\nmore civility of manner; "but you may assure yourself it will be to no\npurpose; for, were his Grace disposed to favour your people, others are\njoined in commission with him who will hardly consent to his doing so.""I shall be sorry to find it thus," said Morton; "but my duty requires\nthat I should persevere in my desire to have an interview with him.""Lumley," said the superior officer, "let the Duke know of Mr Morton\'s\narrival, and remind his Grace that this is the person of whom Lord\nEvandale spoke so highly."The officer returned with a message that the General could not see Mr\nMorton that evening, but would receive him by times in the ensuing\nmorning.He was detained in a neighbouring cottage all night, but treated\nwith civility, and every thing provided for his accommodation.Early on\nthe next morning the officer he had first seen came to conduct him to his\naudience.The army was drawn out, and in the act of forming column for march, or\nattack.The Duke was in the centre, nearly a mile from the place where\nMorton had passed the night.In riding towards the General, he had an\nopportunity of estimating the force which had been assembled for the\nsuppression of the hasty and ill-concerted insurrection.There were three\nor four regiments of English, the flower of Charles\'s army--there were\nthe Scottish Life-Guards, burning with desire to revenge their late\ndefeat--other Scottish regiments of regulars were also assembled, and a\nlarge body of cavalry, consisting partly of gentlemen-volunteers, partly\nof the tenants of the crown who did military duty for their fiefs.Morton\nalso observed several strong parties of Highlanders drawn from the points\nnearest to the Lowland frontiers, a people, as already mentioned,\nparticularly obnoxious to the western whigs, and who hated and despised\nthem in the same proportion.These were assembled under their chiefs, and\nmade part of this formidable array.A complete train of field-artillery\naccompanied these troops; and the whole had an air so imposing, that it\nseemed nothing short of an actual miracle could prevent the ill-equipped,\nill-modelled, and tumultuary army of the insurgents from being utterly\ndestroyed.The officer who accompanied Morton endeavoured to gather from\nhis looks the feelings with which this splendid and awful parade of\nmilitary force had impressed him.But, true to the cause he had espoused,\nhe laboured successfully to prevent the anxiety which he felt from\nappearing in his countenance, and looked around him on the warlike\ndisplay as on a sight which he expected, and to which he was indifferent."You see the entertainment prepared for you," said the officers."If I had no appetite for it," replied Morton, "I should not have been\naccompanying you at this moment.But I shall be better pleased with a\nmore peaceful regale, for the sake of all parties."As they spoke thus, they approached the commander-in-chief, who,\nsurrounded by several officers, was seated upon a knoll commanding an\nextensive prospect of the distant country, and from which could be easily\ndiscovered the windings of the majestic Clyde, and the distant camp of\nthe insurgents on the opposite bank.The officers of the royal army\nappeared to be surveying the ground, with the purpose of directing an\nimmediate attack.When Captain Lumley, the officer who accompanied\nMorton, had whispered in Monmouth\'s ear his name and errand, the Duke\nmade a signal for all around him to retire, excepting only two general\nofficers of distinction.While they spoke together in whispers for a few\nminutes before Morton was permitted to advance, he had time to study the\nappearance of the persons with whom he was to treat.It was impossible for any one to look upon the Duke of Monmouth without\nbeing captivated by his personal graces and accomplishments, of which the\ngreat High-Priest of all the Nine afterwards recorded--\n\n"Whate\'er he did was done with so much ease, In him alone \'twas natural\nto please; His motions all accompanied with grace, And Paradise was\nopen\'d in his face."Yet to a strict observer, the manly beauty of\nMonmouth\'s face was occasionally rendered less striking by an air of\nvacillation and uncertainty, which seemed to imply hesitation and doubt\nat moments when decisive resolution was most necessary.Beside him stood Claverhouse, whom we have already fully described, and\nanother general officer whose appearance was singularly striking.His\ndress was of the antique fashion of Charles the First\'s time, and\ncomposed of shamoy leather, curiously slashed, and covered with antique\nlace and garniture.His boots and spurs might be referred to the same\ndistant period.He wore a breastplate, over which descended a grey beard\nof venerable length, which he cherished as a mark of mourning for Charles\nthe First, having never shaved since that monarch was brought to the\nscaffold.His head was uncovered, and almost perfectly bald.His high and\nwrinkled forehead, piercing grey eyes, and marked features, evinced age\nunbroken by infirmity, and stern resolution unsoftened by humanity.Such\nis the outline, however feebly expressed, of the celebrated General\nThomas Dalzell,\n\n     [Note:  Usually called Tom Dalzell.In Crichton\'s Memoirs, edited by\n     Swift, where a particular account of this remarkable person\'s dress\n     and habits is given, he is said never to have worn boots.The\n     following account of his rencounter with John Paton of Meadowhead,\n     showed, that in action at least he wore pretty stout ones, unless\n     the reader be inclined to believe in the truth of his having a\n     charm, which made him proof against lead."Dalzell," says Paton\'s biographer, "advanced the whole left wing of\n     his army on Colonel Wallace\'s right.Here Captain Paton behaved with\n     great courage and gallantry.Dalzell, knowing him in the former\n     wars, advanced upon him himself, thinking to take him prisoner.Upon\n     his approach, each presented his pistol.On their first discharge,\n     Captain Paton, perceiving his pistol ball to hop upon Dalzell\'s\n     boots, and knowing what was the cause, (he having proof,) put his\n     hand in his pocket for some small pieces of silver he had there for\n     the purpose, and put one of them into his other pistol.But Dalzell,\n     having his eye upon him in the meanwhile, retired behind his own\n     man, who by that means was slain."]a man more feared and hated by the whigs than even Claverhouse himself,\nand who executed the same violences against them out of a detestation of\ntheir persons, or perhaps an innate severity of temper, which Grahame\nonly resorted to on political accounts, as the best means of intimidating\nthe followers of presbytery, and of destroying that sect entirely.The presence of these two generals, one of whom he knew by person, and\nthe other by description, seemed to Morton decisive of the fate of his\nembassy.But, notwithstanding his youth and inexperience, and the\nunfavourable reception which his proposals seemed likely to meet with, he\nadvanced boldly towards them upon receiving a signal to that purpose,\ndetermined that the cause of his country, and of those with whom he had\ntaken up arms, should suffer nothing from being intrusted to him.Monmouth received him with the graceful courtesy which attended even his\nslightest actions; Dalzell regarded him with a stern, gloomy, and\nimpatient frown; and Claverhouse, with a sarcastic smile and inclination\nof his head, seemed to claim him as an old acquaintance."You come, sir, from these unfortunate people, now assembled in arms,"\nsaid the Duke of Monmouth, "and your name, I believe, is Morton; will you\nfavour us with the pupport of your errand?""It is contained, my lord," answered Morton, "in a paper, termed a\nRemonstrance and Supplication, which my Lord Evandale has placed, I\npresume, in your Grace\'s hands?""He has done so, sir," answered the Duke; "and I understand, from Lord\nEvandale, that Mr Morton has behaved in these unhappy matters with much\ntemperance and generosity, for which I have to request his acceptance of\nmy thanks."Here Morton observed Dalzell shake his head indignantly, and whisper\nsomething into Claverhouse\'s ear, who smiled in return, and elevated his\neyebrows, but in a degree so slight as scarce to be perceptible.The\nDuke, taking the petition from his pocket, proceeded, obviously\nstruggling between the native gentleness of his own disposition, and\nperhaps his conviction that the petitioners demanded no more than their\nrights, and the desire, on the other hand, of enforcing the king\'s\nauthority, and complying with the sterner opinions of the colleagues in\noffice, who had been assigned for the purpose of controlling as well as\nadvising him."There are, Mr Morton, in this paper, proposals, as to the abstract\npropriety of which I must now waive delivering any opinion.Some of them\nappear to me reasonable and just; and, although I have no express\ninstructions from the King upon the subject, yet I assure you, Mr Morton,\nand I pledge my honour, that I will interpose in your behalf, and use my\nutmost influence to procure you satisfaction from his Majesty.But you\nmust distinctly understand, that I can only treat with supplicants, not\nwith rebels; and, as a preliminary to every act of favour on my side, I\nmust insist upon your followers laying down their arms and dispersing\nthemselves.""To do so, my Lord Duke," replied Morton, undauntedly, "were to\nacknowledge ourselves the rebels that our enemies term us.Our swords are\ndrawn for recovery of a birthright wrested from us; your Grace\'s\nmoderation and good sense has admitted the general justice of our\ndemand,--a demand which would never have been listened to had it not been\naccompanied with the sound of the trumpet.We cannot, therefore, and dare\nnot, lay down our arms, even on your Grace\'s assurance of indemnity,\nunless it were accompanied with some reasonable prospect of the redress\nof the wrongs which we complain of.""Mr Morton," replied the Duke, "you are young, but you must have seen\nenough of the world to perceive, that requests, by no means dangerous or\nunreasonable in themselves, may become so by the way in which they are\npressed and supported.""We may reply, my lord," answered Morton, "that this disagreeable mode\nhas not been resorted to until all others have failed.""Mr Morton," said the Duke, "I must break this conference short.We are\nin readiness to commence the attack; yet I will suspend it for an hour,\nuntil you can communicate my answer to the insurgents.If they please to\ndisperse their followers, lay down their arms, and send a peaceful\ndeputation to me, I will consider myself bound in honour to do all I can\nto procure redress of their grievances; if not, let them stand on their\nguard and expect the consequences.--I think, gentlemen," he added,\nturning to his two colleagues, "this is the utmost length to which I can\nstretch my instructions in favour of these misguided persons?""By my faith," answered Dalzell, suddenly, "and it is a length to which\nmy poor judgment durst not have stretched them, considering I had both\nthe King and my conscience to answer to!But, doubtless, your Grace knows\nmore of the King\'s private mind than we, who have only the letter of our\ninstructions to look to.""You hear," he said, addressing Morton, "General\nDalzell blames me for the length which I am disposed to go in your\nfavour.""General Dalzell\'s sentiments, my lord," replied Morton, "are such as we\nexpected from him; your Grace\'s such as we were prepared to hope you\nmight please to entertain.Indeed I cannot help adding, that, in the case\nof the absolute submission upon which you are pleased to insist, it might\nstill remain something less than doubtful how far, with such counsellors\naround the King, even your Grace\'s intercession might procure us\neffectual relief.But I will communicate to our leaders your Grace\'s\nanswer to our supplication; and, since we cannot obtain peace, we must\nbid war welcome as well as we may.""Good morning, sir," said the Duke; "I suspend the movements of attack\nfor one hour, and for one hour only.If you have an answer to return\nwithin that space of time, I will receive it here, and earnestly entreat\nit may be such as to save the effusion of blood."At this moment another smile of deep meaning passed between Dalzell and\nClaverhouse.The Duke observed it, and repeated his words with great\ndignity."Yes, gentlemen, I said I trusted the answer might be such as would save\nthe effusion of blood.I hope the sentiment neither needs your scorn, nor\nincurs your displeasure."Dalzell returned the Duke\'s frown with a stern glance, but made no\nanswer.Claverhouse, his lip just curled with an ironical smile, bowed,\nand said, "It was not for him to judge the propriety of his Grace\'s\nsentiments."The Duke made a signal to Morton to withdraw.He obeyed; and, accompanied\nby his former escort, rode slowly through the army to return to the camp\nof the non-conformists.As he passed the fine corps of Life-Guards, he\nfound Claverhouse was already at their head.That officer no sooner saw\nMorton, than he advanced and addressed him with perfect politeness of\nmanner."I think this is not the first time I have seen Mr Morton of Milnwood?""It is not Colonel Grahame\'s fault," said Morton, smiling sternly, "that\nhe or any one else should be now incommoded by my presence.""Allow me at least to say," replied Claverhouse, "that Mr Morton\'s\npresent situation authorizes the opinion I have entertained of him, and\nthat my proceedings at our last meeting only squared to my duty.""To reconcile your actions to your duty, and your duty to your\nconscience, is your business, Colonel Grahame, not mine," said Morton,\njustly offended at being thus, in a manner, required to approve of the\nsentence under which he had so nearly suffered."Nay, but stay an instant," said Claverhouse; "Evandale insists that I\nhave some wrongs to acquit myself of in your instance.I trust I shall\nalways make some difference between a high-minded gentleman, who, though\nmisguided, acts upon generous principles, and the crazy fanatical clowns\nyonder, with the bloodthirsty assassins who head them.Therefore, if they\ndo not disperse upon your return, let me pray you instantly come over to\nour army and surrender yourself, for, be assured, they cannot stand our\nassault for half an hour.If you will be ruled and do this, be sure to\nenquire for me.Monmouth, strange as it may seem, cannot protect\nyou--Dalzell will not--I both can and will; and I have promised to\nEvandale to do so if you will give me an opportunity.""I should owe Lord Evandale my thanks," answered Morton, coldly, "did not\nhis scheme imply an opinion that I might be prevailed on to desert those\nwith whom I am engaged.For you, Colonel Grahame, if you will honour me\nwith a different species of satisfaction, it is probable, that, in an\nhour\'s time, you will find me at the west end of Bothwell Bridge with my\nsword in my hand.""I shall be happy to meet you there," said Claverhouse, "but still more\nso should you think better on my first proposal.""That is a pretty lad, Lumley," said Claverhouse, addressing himself to\nthe other officer; "but he is a lost man--his blood be upon his head."So saying, he addressed himself to the task of preparation for instant\nbattle.CHAPTER X.\n\n               But, hark!the tent has changed its voice,\n               There\'s peace and rest nae langer.The Lowdien Mallisha they\n               Came with their coats of blew;\n               Five hundred men from London came,\n               Claid in a reddish hue.When Morton had left the well-ordered outposts of the regular army, and\narrived at those which were maintained by his own party, he could not but\nbe peculiarly sensible of the difference of discipline, and entertain a\nproportional degree of fear for the consequences.The same discords which\nagitated the counsels of the insurgents, raged even among their meanest\nfollowers; and their picquets and patrols were more interested and\noccupied in disputing the true occasion and causes of wrath, and defining\nthe limits of Erastian heresy, than in looking out for and observing the\nmotions of their enemies, though within hearing of the royal drums and\ntrumpets.There was a guard, however, of the insurgent army, posted at the long and\nnarrow bridge of Bothwell, over which the enemy must necessarily advance\nto the attack; but, like the others, they were divided and disheartened;\nand, entertaining the idea that they were posted on a desperate service,\nthey even meditated withdrawing themselves to the main body.This would\nhave been utter ruin; for, on the defence or loss of this pass the\nfortune of the day was most likely to depend.All beyond the bridge was a\nplain open field, excepting a few thickets of no great depth, and,\nconsequently, was ground on which the undisciplined forces of the\ninsurgents, deficient as they were in cavalry, and totally unprovided\nwith artillery, were altogether unlikely to withstand the shock of\nregular troops.Morton, therefore, viewed the pass carefully, and formed the hope, that\nby occupying two or three houses on the left bank of the river, with the\ncopse and thickets of alders and hazels that lined its side, and by\nblockading the passage itself, and shutting the gates of a portal, which,\naccording to the old fashion, was built on the central arch of the bridge\nof Bothwell, it might be easily defended against a very superior force.He issued directions accordingly, and commanded the parapets of the\nbridge, on the farther side of the portal, to be thrown down, that they\nmight afford no protection to the enemy when they should attempt the\npassage.Morton then conjured the party at this important post to be\nwatchful and upon their guard, and promised them a speedy and strong\nreinforcement.He caused them to advance videttes beyond the river to\nwatch the progress of the enemy, which outposts he directed should be\nwithdrawn to the left bank as soon as they approached; finally, he\ncharged them to send regular information to the main body of all that\nthey should observe.Men under arms, and in a situation of danger, are\nusually sufficiently alert in appreciating the merit of their officers.Morton\'s intelligence and activity gained the confidence of these men,\nand with better hope and heart than before, they began to fortify their\nposition in the manner he recommended, and saw him depart with three loud\ncheers.Morton now galloped hastily towards the main body of the insurgents, but\nwas surprised and shocked at the scene of confusion and clamour which it\nexhibited, at the moment when good order and concord were of such\nessential consequence.Instead of being drawn up in line of battle, and\nlistening to the commands of their officers, they were crowding together\nin a confused mass, that rolled and agitated itself like the waves of the\nsea, while a thousand tongues spoke, or rather vociferated, and not a\nsingle ear was found to listen.Scandalized at a scene so extraordinary,\nMorton endeavoured to make his way through the press to learn, and, if\npossible, to remove, the cause of this so untimely disorder.While he is\nthus engaged, we shall make the reader acquainted with that which he was\nsome time in discovering.The insurgents had proceeded to hold their day of humiliation, which,\nagreeably to the practice of the puritans during the earlier civil war,\nthey considered as the most effectual mode of solving all difficulties,\nand waiving all discussions.It was usual to name an ordinary week-day\nfor this purpose, but on this occasion the Sabbath itself was adopted,\nowing to the pressure of the time and the vicinity of the enemy.A\ntemporary pulpit, or tent, was erected in the middle of the encampment;\nwhich, according to the fixed arrangement, was first to be occupied by\nthe Reverend Peter Poundtext, to whom the post of honour was assigned, as\nthe eldest clergyman present.But as the worthy divine, with slow and\nstately steps, was advancing towards the rostrum which had been prepared\nfor him, he was prevented by the unexpected apparition of Habakkuk\nMucklewrath, the insane preacher, whose appearance had so much startled\nMorton at the first council of the insurgents after their victory at\nLoudon-hill.It is not known whether he was acting under the influence\nand instigation of the Cameronians, or whether he was merely compelled by\nhis own agitated imagination, and the temptation of a vacant pulpit\nbefore him, to seize the opportunity of exhorting so respectable a\ncongregation.It is only certain that he took occasion by the forelock,\nsprung into the pulpit, cast his eyes wildly round him, and, undismayed\nby the murmurs of many of the audience, opened the Bible, read forth as\nhis text from the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, "Certain men, the\nchildren of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the\ninhabitants of their city, saying, let us go and serve other gods, which\nyou have not known;" and then rushed at once into the midst of his\nsubject.The harangue of Mucklewrath was as wild and extravagant as his intrusion\nwas unauthorized and untimely; but it was provokingly coherent, in so far\nas it turned entirely upon the very subjects of discord, of which it had\nbeen agreed to adjourn the consideration until some more suitable\nopportunity.Not a single topic did he omit which had offence in it; and,\nafter charging the moderate party with heresy, with crouching to tyranny,\nwith seeking to be at peace with God\'s enemies, he applied to Morton, by\nname, the charge that he had been one of those men of Belial, who, in the\nwords of his text, had gone out from amongst them, to withdraw the\ninhabitants of his city, and to go astray after false gods.To him, and\nall who followed him, or approved of his conduct, Mucklewrath denounced\nfury and vengeance, and exhorted those who would hold themselves pure and\nundefiled to come up from the midst of them."Fear not," he said, "because of the neighing of horses, or the\nglittering of breastplates.Seek not aid of the Egyptians, because of the\nenemy, though they may be numerous as locusts, and fierce as dragons.Their trust is not as our trust, nor their rock as our rock; how else\nshall a thousand fly before one, and two put ten thousand to the flight!I dreamed it in the visions of the night, and the voice said, \'Habakkuk,\ntake thy fan and purge the wheat from the chaff, that they be not both\nconsumed with the fire of indignation and the lightning of fury.\'Wherefore, I say, take this Henry Morton--this wretched Achan, who hath\nbrought the accursed thing among ye, and made himself brethren in the\ncamp of the enemy--take him and stone him with stones, and thereafter\nburn him with fire, that the wrath may depart from the children of the\nCovenant.He hath not taken a Babylonish garment, but he hath sold the\ngarment of righteousness to the woman of Babylon--he hath not taken two\nhundred shekels of fine silver, but he hath bartered the truth, which is\nmore precious than shekels of silver or wedges of gold."At this furious charge, brought so unexpectedly against one of their most\nactive commanders, the audience broke out into open tumult, some\ndemanding that there should instantly be a new election of officers, into\nwhich office none should hereafter be admitted who had, in their phrase,\ntouched of that which was accursed, or temporized more or less with the\nheresies and corruptions of the times.While such was the demand of the\nCameronians, they vociferated loudly, that those who were not with them\nwere against them,--that it was no time to relinquish the substantial\npart of the covenanted testimony of the Church, if they expected a\nblessing on their arms and their cause; and that, in their eyes, a\nlukewarm Presbyterian was little better than a Prelatist, an\nAnti-Covenanter, and a Nullifidian.The parties accused repelled the charge of criminal compliance and\ndefection from the truth with scorn and indignation, and charged their\naccusers with breach of faith, as well as with wrong-headed and\nextravagant zeal in introducing such divisions into an army, the joint\nstrength of which could not, by the most sanguine, be judged more than\nsufficient to face their enemies.Poundtext, and one or two others, made\nsome faint efforts to stem the increasing fury of the factious,\nexclaiming to those of the other party, in the words of the\nPatriarch,--"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,\nand between thy herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we be brethren."No\npacific overture could possibly obtain audience.It was in vain that\neven Burley himself, when he saw the dissension proceed to such ruinous\nlengths, exerted his stern and deep voice, commanding silence and\nobedience to discipline.The spirit of insubordination had gone forth,\nand it seemed as if the exhortation of Habakkuk Mucklewrath had\ncommunicated a part of his frenzy to all who heard him.The wiser, or\nmore timid part of the assembly, were already withdrawing themselves\nfrom the field, and giving up their cause as lost.Others were\nmoderating a harmonious call, as they somewhat improperly termed it, to\nnew officers, and dismissing those formerly chosen, and that with a\ntumult and clamour worthy of the deficiency of good sense and good order\nimplied in the whole transaction.It was at this moment when Morton\narrived in the field and joined the army, in total confusion, and on the\npoint of dissolving itself.His arrival occasioned loud exclamations of\napplause on the one side, and of imprecation on the other."What means this ruinous disorder at such a moment?"he exclaimed to\nBurley, who, exhausted with his vain exertions to restore order, was now\nleaning on his sword, and regarding the confusion with an eye of resolute\ndespair."It means," he replied, "that God has delivered us into the hands of our\nenemies.""Not so," answered Morton, with a voice and gesture which compelled many\nto listen; "it is not God who deserts us, it is we who desert him, and\ndishonour ourselves by disgracing and betraying the cause of freedom and\nreligion.--Hear me," he exclaimed, springing to the pulpit which\nMucklewrath had been compelled to evacuate by actual exhaustion--"I bring\nfrom the enemy an offer to treat, if you incline to lay down your arms.I\ncan assure you the means of making an honourable defence, if you are of\nmore manly tempers.Let us resolve either for\npeace or war; and let it not be said of us in future days, that six\nthousand Scottish men in arms had neither courage to stand their ground\nand fight it out, nor prudence to treat for peace, nor even the coward\'s\nwisdom to retreat in good time and with safety.What signifies\nquarrelling on minute points of church-discipline, when the whole edifice\nis threatened with total destruction?O, remember, my brethren, that the\nlast and worst evil which God brought upon the people whom he had once\nchosen--the last and worst punishment of their blindness and hardness of\nheart, was the bloody dissensions which rent asunder their city, even\nwhen the enemy were thundering at its gates!"Some of the audience testified their feeling of this exhortation, by loud\nexclamations of applause; others by hooting, and exclaiming--"To your\ntents, O Israel!"Morton, who beheld the columns of the enemy already beginning to appear\non the right bank, and directing their march upon the bridge, raised his\nvoice to its utmost pitch, and, pointing at the same time with his hand,\nexclaimed,--"Silence your senseless clamours, yonder is the enemy!On\nmaintaining the bridge against him depend our lives, as well as our hope\nto reclaim our laws and liberties.--There shall at least one Scottishman\ndie in their defence.--Let any one who loves his country follow me!"The multitude had turned their heads in the direction to which he\npointed.The sight of the glittering files of the English Foot-Guards,\nsupported by several squadrons of horse, of the cannon which the\nartillerymen were busily engaged in planting against the bridge, of the\nplaided clans who seemed to search for a ford, and of the long succession\nof troops which were destined to support the attack, silenced at once\ntheir clamorous uproar, and struck them with as much consternation as if\nit were an unexpected apparition, and not the very thing which they ought\nto have been looking out for.They gazed on each other, and on their\nleaders, with looks resembling those that indicate the weakness of a\npatient when exhausted by a fit of frenzy.Yet when Morton, springing\nfrom the rostrum, directed his steps towards the bridge, he was followed\nby about an hundred of the young men who were particularly attached to\nhis command.Burley turned to Macbriar--"Ephraim," he said, "it is Providence points\nus the way, through the worldly wisdom of this latitudinarian youth.--He\nthat loves the light, let him follow Burley!""Tarry," replied Macbriar; "it is not by Henry Morton, or such as he,\nthat our goings-out and our comings-in are to be meted; therefore tarry\nwith us.I fear treachery to the host from this nullifidian Achan--Thou\nshalt not go with him.Thou art our chariots and our horsemen.""Hinder me not," replied Burley; "he hath well said that all is lost, if\nthe enemy win the bridge--therefore let me not.Shall the children of\nthis generation be called wiser or braver than the children of the\nsanctuary?--Array yourselves under your leaders--let us not lack supplies\nof men and ammunition; and accursed be he who turneth back from the work\non this great day!"Having thus spoken, he hastily marched towards the bridge, and was\nfollowed by about two hundred of the most gallant and zealous of his\nparty.There was a deep and disheartened pause when Morton and Burley\ndeparted.The commanders availed themselves of it to display their lines\nin some sort of order, and exhorted those who were most exposed to throw\nthemselves upon their faces to avoid the cannonade which they might\npresently expect.The insurgents ceased to resist or to remonstrate; but\nthe awe which had silenced their discords had dismayed their courage.They suffered themselves to be formed into ranks with the docility of a\nflock of sheep, but without possessing, for the time, more resolution or\nenergy; for they experienced a sinking of the heart, imposed by the\nsudden and imminent approach of the danger which they had neglected to\nprovide against while it was yet distant.They were, however, drawn out\nwith some regularity; and as they still possessed the appearance of an\narmy, their leaders had only to hope that some favourable circumstance\nwould restore their spirits and courage.Kettledrummle, Poundtext, Macbriar, and other preachers, busied\nthemselves in their ranks, and prevailed on them to raise a psalm.But\nthe superstitious among them observed, as an ill omen, that their song of\npraise and triumph sunk into "a quaver of consternation," and resembled\nrather a penitentiary stave sung on the scaffold of a condemned criminal,\nthan the bold strain which had resounded along the wild heath of\nLoudon-hill, in anticipation of that day\'s victory.The melancholy melody\nsoon received a rough accompaniment; the royal soldiers shouted, the\nHighlanders yelled, the cannon began to fire on one side, and the\nmusketry on both, and the bridge of Bothwell, with the banks adjacent,\nwere involved in wreaths of smoke.As e\'er ye saw the rain doun fa\',\n                    Or yet the arrow from the bow,\n                    Sae our Scots lads fell even down,\n                    And they lay slain on every knowe.Ere Morton or Burley had reached the post to be defended, the enemy had\ncommenced an attack upon it with great spirit.The two regiments of\nFoot-Guards, formed into a close column, rushed forward to the river; one\ncorps, deploying along the right bank, commenced a galling fire on the\ndefenders of the pass, while the other pressed on to occupy the bridge.The insurgents sustained the attack with great constancy and courage; and\nwhile part of their number returned the fire across the river, the rest\nmaintained a discharge of musketry upon the further end of the bridge\nitself, and every avenue by which the soldiers endeavoured to approach\nit.The latter suffered severely, but still gained ground, and the head\nof their column was already upon the bridge, when the arrival of Morton\nchanged the scene; and his marksmen, commencing upon the pass a fire as\nwell aimed as it was sustained and regular, compelled the assailants to\nretire with much loss.They were a second time brought up to the charge,\nand a second time repulsed with still greater loss, as Burley had now\nbrought his party into action.The fire was continued with the utmost\nvehemence on both sides, and the issue of the action seemed very dubious.Monmouth, mounted on a superb white charger, might be discovered on the\ntop of the right bank of the river, urging, entreating, and animating the\nexertions of his soldiers.By his orders, the cannon, which had hitherto\nbeen employed in annoying the distant main body of the presbyterians,\nwere now turned upon the defenders of the bridge.But these tremendous\nengines, being wrought much more slowly than in modern times, did not\nproduce the effect of annoying or terrifying the enemy to the extent\nproposed.The insurgents, sheltered by copsewood along the bank of the\nriver, or stationed in the houses already mentioned, fought under cover,\nwhile the royalists, owing to the precautions of Morton, were entirely\nexposed.The defence was so protracted and obstinate, that the royal\ngenerals began to fear it might be ultimately successful.While Monmouth\nthrew himself from his horse, and, rallying the Foot-Guards, brought them\non to another close and desperate attack, he was warmly seconded\nby Dalzell, who, putting himself at the head of a body of\nLennox-Highlanders, rushed forward with their tremendous war-cry of\nLoch-sloy.[Note: This was the slogan or war-cry of the MacFarlanes, taken from\n     a lake near the head of Loch Lomond, in the centre of their ancient\n     possessions on the western banks of that beautiful inland sea.]The ammunition of the defenders of the bridge began to fail at this\nimportant crisis; messages, commanding and imploring succours and\nsupplies, were in vain dispatched, one after the other, to the main body\nof the presbyterian army, which remained inactively drawn up on the open\nfields in the rear.Fear, consternation, and misrule, had gone abroad\namong them, and while the post on which their safety depended required\nto be instantly and powerfully reinforced, there remained none either to\ncommand or to obey.As the fire of the defenders of the bridge began to slacken, that of the\nassailants increased, and in its turn became more fatal.Animated by the\nexample and exhortations of their generals, they obtained a footing upon\nthe bridge itself, and began to remove the obstacles by which it was\nblockaded.The portal-gate was broke open, the beams, trunks of trees,\nand other materials of the barricade, pulled down and thrown into the\nriver.Morton and Burley\nfought in the very front of their followers, and encouraged them with\ntheir pikes, halberds, and partisans, to encounter the bayonets of the\nGuards, and the broadswords of the Highlanders.But those behind the\nleaders began to shrink from the unequal combat, and fly singly, or in\nparties of two or three, towards the main body, until the remainder were,\nby the mere weight of the hostile column as much as by their weapons,\nfairly forced from the bridge.The passage being now open, the enemy\nbegan to pour over.But the bridge was long and narrow, which rendered\nthe manoeuvre slow as well as dangerous; and those who first passed had\nstill to force the houses, from the windows of which the Covenanters\ncontinued to fire.Burley and Morton were near each other at this\ncritical moment."There is yet time," said the former, "to bring down horse to attack\nthem, ere they can get into order; and, with the aid of God, we may thus\nregain the bridge--hasten thou to bring them down, while I make the\ndefence good with this old and wearied body."Morton saw the importance of the advice, and, throwing himself on the\nhorse which cuddie held in readiness for him behind the thicket, galloped\ntowards a body of cavalry which chanced to be composed entirely of\nCameronians.Ere he could speak his errand, or utter his orders, he was\nsaluted by the execrations of the whole body.they exclaimed--"the cowardly traitor flies like a hart from\nthe hunters, and hath left valiant Burley in the midst of the slaughter!""I come to lead you to the attack.Advance\nboldly, and we shall yet do well."--such were the tumultuous exclamations\nwhich resounded from the ranks;--"he hath sold you to the sword of the\nenemy!"And while Morton argued, entreated, and commanded in vain, the moment was\nlost in which the advance might have been useful; and the outlet from the\nbridge, with all its defences, being in complete possession of the enemy,\nBurley and his remaining followers were driven back upon the main body,\nto whom the spectacle of their hurried and harassed retreat was far from\nrestoring the confidence which they so much wanted.In the meanwhile, the forces of the King crossed the bridge at their\nleisure, and, securing the pass, formed in line of battle; while\nClaverhouse, who, like a hawk perched on a rock, and eyeing the time to\npounce on its prey, had watched the event of the action from the opposite\nbank, now passed the bridge at the head of his cavalry, at full trot,\nand, leading them in squadrons through the intervals and round the flanks\nof the royal infantry, formed them in line on the moor, and led them to\nthe charge, advancing in front with one large body, while other two\ndivisions threatened the flanks of the Covenanters.Their devoted army\nwas now in that situation when the slightest demonstration towards an\nattack was certain to inspire panic.Their broken spirits and\ndisheartened courage were unable to endure the charge of the cavalry,\nattended with all its terrible accompaniments of sight and sound;--the\nrush of the horses at full speed, the shaking of the earth under their\nfeet, the glancing of the swords, the waving of the plumes, and the\nfierce shouts of the cavaliers.The front ranks hardly attempted one\nill-directed and disorderly fire, and their rear were broken and flying\nin confusion ere the charge had been completed; and in less than five\nminutes the horsemen were mixed with them, cutting and hewing without\nmercy.The voice of Claverhouse was heard, even above the din of\nconflict, exclaiming to his soldiers--"Kill, kill--no quarter--think on\nRichard Grahame!"The dragoons, many of whom had shared the disgrace of\nLoudon-hill, required no exhortations to vengeance as easy as it was\ncomplete.Their swords drank deep of slaughter among the unresisting\nfugitives.Screams for quarter were only answered by the shouts with\nwhich the pursuers accompanied their blows, and the whole field presented\none general scene of confused slaughter, flight, and pursuit.About twelve hundred of the insurgents who remained in a body a little\napart from the rest, and out of the line of the charge of cavalry, threw\ndown their arms and surrendered at discretion, upon the approach of the\nDuke of Monmouth at the head of the infantry.That mild-tempered nobleman\ninstantly allowed them the quarter which they prayed for; and, galloping\nabout through the field, exerted himself as much to stop the slaughter as\nhe had done to obtain the victory.While busied in this humane task he\nmet with General Dalzell, who was encouraging the fierce Highlanders and\nroyal volunteers to show their zeal for King and country, by quenching\nthe flame of the rebellion with the blood of the rebels."Sheathe your sword, I command you, General!"exclaimed the Duke, "and\nsound the retreat.Enough of blood has been shed; give quarter to the\nKing\'s misguided subjects.""I obey your Grace," said the old man, wiping his bloody sword and\nreturning it to the scabbard; "but I warn you, at the same time, that\nenough has not been done to intimidate these desperate rebels.Has not\nyour Grace heard that Basil Olifant has collected several gentlemen and\nmen of substance in the west, and is in the act of marching to join\nthem?"said the Duke; "who, or what is he?""The next male heir to the last Earl of Torwood.He is disaffected to\ngovernment from his claim to the estate being set aside in favour of Lady\nMargaret Bellenden; and I suppose the hope of getting the inheritance has\nset him in motion.""Be his motives what they will," replied Monmouth, "he must soon disperse\nhis followers, for this army is too much broken to rally again.Therefore, once more, I command that the pursuit be stopped.""It is your Grace\'s province to command, and to be responsible for your\ncommands," answered Dalzell, as he gave reluctant orders for checking the\npursuit.But the fiery and vindictive Grahame was already far out of hearing of\nthe signal of retreat, and continued with his cavalry an unwearied and\nbloody pursuit, breaking, dispersing, and cutting to pieces all the\ninsurgents whom they could come up with.Burley and Morton were both hurried off the field by the confused tide of\nfugitives.They made some attempt to defend the streets of the town of\nHamilton; but, while labouring to induce the fliers to face about and\nstand to their weapons.Burley received a bullet which broke his\nsword-arm."May the hand be withered that shot the shot!"he exclaimed, as the sword\nwhich he was waving over his head fell powerless to his side.[Note: This incident, and Burley\'s exclamation, are\ntaken from the records.]Then turning his horse\'s head, he retreated out of the confusion.Morton\nalso now saw that the continuing his unavailing efforts to rally the\nfliers could only end in his own death or captivity, and, followed by the\nfaithful Cuddie, he extricated himself from the press, and, being well\nmounted, leaped his horse over one or two enclosures, and got into the\nopen country.From the first hill which they gained in their flight, they looked back,\nand beheld the whole country covered with their fugitive companions, and\nwith the pursuing dragoons, whose wild shouts and halloo, as they did\nexecution on the groups whom they overtook, mingled with the groans and\nscreams of their victims, rose shrilly up the hill."It is impossible they can ever make head again," said Morton."The head\'s taen aff them, as clean as I wad bite it aff a sybo!"They\'ll be cunning that catches me at this wark\nagain.--But, for God\'s sake, sir, let us mak for some strength!"Morton saw the necessity of following the advice of his trusty squire.They resumed a rapid pace, and continued it without intermission,\ndirecting their course towards the wild and mountainous country, where\nthey thought it likely some part of the fugitives might draw together,\nfor the sake either of making defence, or of obtaining terms.They require\n               Of Heaven the hearts of lions, breath of tigers,\n               Yea and the fierceness too.Evening had fallen; and, for the last two hours, they had seen none of\ntheir ill-fated companions, when Morton and his faithful attendant gained\nthe moorland, and approached a large and solitary farmhouse, situated in\nthe entrance of a wild glen, far remote from any other habitation."Our horses," said Morton, "will carry us no farther without rest or\nfood, and we must try to obtain them here, if possible."So speaking, he led the way to the house.The place had every appearance\nof being inhabited.There was smoke issuing from the chimney in a\nconsiderable volume, and the marks of recent hoofs were visible around\nthe door.They could even hear the murmuring of human voices within the\nhouse.But all the lower windows were closely secured; and when they\nknocked at the door, no answer was returned.After vainly calling and\nentreating admittance, they withdrew to the stable, or shed, in order to\naccommodate their horses, ere they used farther means of gaining\nadmission.In this place they found ten or twelve horses, whose state of\nfatigue, as well as the military yet disordered appearance of their\nsaddles and accoutrements, plainly indicated that their owners were\nfugitive insurgents in their own circumstances."This meeting bodes luck," said Cuddie; "and they hae walth o\' beef,\nthat\'s ae thing certain, for here\'s a raw hide that has been about the\nhurdies o\' a stot not half an hour syne--it\'s warm yet."Encouraged by these appearances, they returned again to the house, and,\nannouncing themselves as men in the same predicament with the inmates,\nclamoured loudly for admittance."Whoever ye be," answered a stern voice from the window, after a long and\nobdurate silence, "disturb not those who mourn for the desolation and\ncaptivity of the land, and search out the causes of wrath and of\ndefection, that the stumbling-blocks may be removed over which we have\nstumbled.""They are wild western whigs," said Cuddie, in a whisper to his master,\n"I ken by their language.Fiend hae me, if I like to venture on them!"Morton, however, again called to the party within, and insisted on\nadmittance; but, finding his entreaties still disregarded, he opened one\nof the lower windows, and pushing asunder the shutters, which were but\nslightly secured, stepped into the large kitchen from which the voice had\nissued.Cuddie followed him, muttering betwixt his teeth, as he put his\nhead within the window, "That he hoped there was nae scalding brose on\nthe fire;" and master and servant both found themselves in the company of\nten or twelve armed men, seated around the fire, on which refreshments\nwere preparing, and busied apparently in their devotions.In the gloomy countenances, illuminated by the fire-light, Morton had no\ndifficulty in recognising several of those zealots who had most\ndistinguished themselves by their intemperate opposition to all moderate\nmeasures, together with their noted pastor, the fanatical Ephraim\nMacbriar, and the maniac, Habakkuk Mucklewrath.The Cameronians neither\nstirred tongue nor hand to welcome their brethren in misfortune, but\ncontinued to listen to the low murmured exercise of Macbriar, as he\nprayed that the Almighty would lift up his hand from his people, and not\nmake an end in the day of his anger.That they were conscious of the\npresence of the intruders only appeared from the sullen and indignant\nglances which they shot at them, from time to time, as their eyes\nencountered.Morton, finding into what unfriendly society he had unwittingly intruded,\nbegan to think of retreating; but, on turning his head, observed with\nsome alarm, that two strong men had silently placed themselves beside the\nwindow, through which they had entered.One of these ominous sentinels\nwhispered to Cuddie, "Son of that precious woman, Mause Headrigg, do not\ncast thy lot farther with this child of treachery and perdition--Pass on\nthy way, and tarry not, for the avenger of blood is behind thee."With this he pointed to the window, out of which Cuddie jumped without\nhesitation; for the intimation he had received plainly implied the\npersonal danger he would otherwise incur."Winnocks are no lucky wi\' me," was his first reflection when he was in\nthe open air; his next was upon the probable fate of his master."They\'ll\nkill him, the murdering loons, and think they\'re doing a gude turn!but\nI\'se tak the back road for Hamilton, and see if I canna get some o\' our\nain folk to bring help in time of needcessity."So saying, Cuddie hastened to the stable, and taking the best horse he\ncould find instead of his own tired animal, he galloped off in the\ndirection he proposed.The noise of his horse\'s tread alarmed for an instant the devotion of the\nfanatics.As it died in the distance, Macbriar brought his exercise to a\nconclusion, and his audience raised themselves from the stooping posture,\nand louring downward look, with which they had listened to it, and all\nfixed their eyes sternly on Henry Morton."You bend strange countenances on me, gentlemen," said he, addressing\nthem."I am totally ignorant in what manner I can have deserved them."exclaimed Mucklewrath, starting up: "the\nword that thou hast spurned shall become a rock to crush and to bruise\nthee; the spear which thou wouldst have broken shall pierce thy side; we\nhave prayed, and wrestled, and petitioned for an offering to atone the\nsins of the congregation, and lo!the very head of the offence is\ndelivered into our hand.He hath burst in like a thief through the\nwindow; he is a ram caught in the thicket, whose blood shall be a\ndrink-offering to redeem vengeance from the church, and the place shall\nfrom henceforth be called Jehovah-Jireh, for the sacrifice is provided.Up then, and bind the victim with cords to the horns of the altar!"There was a movement among the party; and deeply did Morton regret at\nthat moment the incautious haste with which he had ventured into their\ncompany.He was armed only with his sword, for he had left his pistols at\nthe bow of his saddle; and, as the whigs were all provided with\nfire-arms, there was little or no chance of escaping from them by\nresistance.The interposition, however, of Macbriar protected him for the\nmoment."Tarry yet a while, brethren--let us not use the sword rashly, lest the\nload of innocent blood lie heavy on us.--Come," he said, addressing\nhimself to Morton, "we will reckon with thee ere we avenge the cause thou\nhast betrayed.--Hast thou not," he continued, "made thy face as hard as\nflint against the truth in all the assemblies of the host?""He has--he has," murmured the deep voices of the assistants."He hath ever urged peace with the malignants," said one."And pleaded for the dark and dismal guilt of the Indulgence," said\nanother."And would have surrendered the host into the hands of Monmouth," echoed\na third; "and was the first to desert the honest and manly Burley, while\nhe yet resisted at the pass.I saw him on the moor, with his horse bloody\nwith spurring, long ere the firing had ceased at the bridge.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "if you mean to bear me down by clamour, and\ntake my life without hearing me, it is perhaps a thing in your power; but\nyou will sin before God and man by the commission of such a murder.""I say, hear the youth," said Macbriar; "for Heaven knows our bowels have\nyearned for him, that he might be brought to see the truth, and exert his\ngifts in its defence.But he is blinded by his carnal knowledge, and has\nspurned the light when it blazed before him."Silence being obtained, Morton proceeded to assert the good faith which\nhe had displayed in the treaty with Monmouth, and the active part he had\nborne in the subsequent action."I may not, gentlemen," he said, "be fully able to go the lengths you\ndesire, in assigning to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing\nover others; but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful\nfreedom.And I must needs aver, that had others been of my mind in\ncounsel, or disposed to stand by my side in battle, we should this\nevening, instead of being a defeated and discordant remnant, have\nsheathed our weapons in an useful and honourable peace, or brandished\nthem triumphantly after a decisive victory.""He hath spoken the word," said one of the assembly--"he hath avowed his\ncarnal self-seeking and Erastianism; let him die the death!""Peace yet again," said Macbriar, "for I will try him further.--Was it\nnot by thy means that the malignant Evandale twice escaped from death and\ncaptivity?Was it not through thee that Miles Bellenden and his garrison\nof cut-throats were saved from the edge of the sword?""I am proud to say, that you have spoken the truth in both instances,"\nreplied Morton.you see," said Macbriar, "again hath his mouth spoken it.--And didst\nthou not do this for the sake of a Midianitish woman, one of the spawn of\nprelacy, a toy with which the arch-enemy\'s trap is baited?Didst thou not\ndo all this for the sake of Edith Bellenden?""You are incapable," answered Morton, boldly, "of appreciating my\nfeelings towards that young lady; but all that I have done I would have\ndone had she never existed.""Thou art a hardy rebel to the truth," said another dark-brow\'d man; "and\ndidst thou not so act, that, by conveying away the aged woman, Margaret\nBellenden, and her grand-daughter, thou mightest thwart the wise and\ngodly project of John Balfour of Burley for bringing forth to battle\nBasil Olifant, who had agreed to take the field if he were insured\npossession of these women\'s worldly endowments?""I never heard of such a scheme," said Morton, "and therefore I could not\nthwart it.--But does your religion permit you to take such uncreditable\nand immoral modes of recruiting?""Peace," said Macbriar, somewhat disconcerted; "it is not for thee to\ninstruct tender professors, or to construe Covenant obligations.For the\nrest, you have acknowledged enough of sin and sorrowful defection, to\ndraw down defeat on a host, were it as numerous as the sands on the\nsea-shore.And it is our judgment, that we are not free to let you pass\nfrom us safe and in life, since Providence hath given you into our hands\nat the moment that we prayed with godly Joshua, saying, \'What shall we\nsay when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?\'--Then camest\nthou, delivered to us as it were by lot, that thou mightest sustain the\npunishment of one that hath wrought folly in Israel.This is the Sabbath, and our hand shall not be on thee to spill\nthy blood upon this day; but, when the twelfth hour shall strike, it is a\ntoken that thy time on earth hath run!Wherefore improve thy span, for it\nflitteth fast away.--Seize on the prisoner, brethren, and take his\nweapon."The command was so unexpectedly given, and so suddenly executed by those\nof the party who had gradually closed behind and around Morton, that he\nwas overpowered, disarmed, and a horse-girth passed round his arms,\nbefore he could offer any effectual resistance.When this was\naccomplished, a dead and stern silence took place.The fanatics ranged\nthemselves around a large oaken table, placing Morton amongst them bound\nand helpless, in such a manner as to be opposite to the clock which was\nto strike his knell.Food was placed before them, of which they offered\ntheir intended victim a share; but, it will readily be believed, he had\nlittle appetite.When this was removed, the party resumed their\ndevotions.Macbriar, whose fierce zeal did not perhaps exclude some\nfeelings of doubt and compunction, began to expostulate in prayer, as if\nto wring from the Deity a signal that the bloody sacrifice they proposed\nwas an acceptable service.The eyes and ears of his hearers were\nanxiously strained, as if to gain some sight or sound which might be\nconverted or wrested into a type of approbation, and ever and anon dark\nlooks were turned on the dial-plate of the time-piece, to watch its\nprogress towards the moment of execution.Morton\'s eye frequently took the same course, with the sad reflection,\nthat there appeared no posibility of his life being expanded beyond the\nnarrow segment which the index had yet to travel on the circle until it\narrived at the fatal hour.Faith in his religion, with a constant\nunyielding principle of honour, and the sense of conscious innocence,\nenabled him to pass through this dreadful interval with less agitation\nthan he himself could have expected, had the situation been prophesied to\nhim.Yet there was a want of that eager and animating sense of right\nwhich supported him in similar circumstances, when in the power of\nClaverhouse.Then he was conscious, that, amid the spectators, were many\nwho were lamenting his condition, and some who applauded his conduct.But\nnow, among these pale-eyed and ferocious zealots, whose hardened brows\nwere soon to be bent, not merely with indifference, but with triumph,\nupon his execution,--without a friend to speak a kindly word, or give a\nlook either of sympathy or encouragement,--awaiting till the sword\ndestined to slay him crept out of the scabbard gradually, and as it were\nby strawbreadths, and condemned to drink the bitterness of death drop by\ndrop,--it is no wonder that his feelings were less composed than they had\nbeen on any former occasion of danger.His destined executioners, as he\ngazed around them, seemed to alter their forms and features, like\nspectres in a feverish dream; their figures became larger, and their\nfaces more disturbed; and, as an excited imagination predominated over\nthe realities which his eyes received, he could have thought himself\nsurrounded rather by a band of demons than of human beings; the walls\nseemed to drop with blood, and the light tick of the clock thrilled on\nhis ear with such loud, painful distinctness, as if each sound were the\nprick of a bodkin inflicted on the naked nerve of the organ.[Illustration: Morton Awaiting Death--frontispiece2]\n\n\nIt was with pain that he felt his mind wavering, while on the brink\nbetween this and the future world.He made a strong effort to compose\nhimself to devotional exercises, and unequal, during that fearful strife\nof nature, to arrange his own thoughts into suitable expressions, he had,\ninstinctively, recourse to the petition for deliverance and for composure\nof spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church\nof England.Macbriar, whose family were of that persuasion, instantly\nrecognised the words, which the unfortunate prisoner pronounced half\naloud."There lacked but this," he said, his pale cheek kindling with\nresentment, "to root out my carnal reluctance to see his blood spilt.He\nis a prelatist, who has sought the camp under the disguise of an\nErastian, and all, and more than all, that has been said of him must\nneeds be verity.His blood be on his head, the deceiver!--let him go down\nto Tophet, with the ill-mumbled mass which he calls a prayer-book, in his\nright hand!""As the sun went\nback on the dial ten degrees for intimating the recovery of holy\nHezekiah, so shall it now go forward, that the wicked may be taken away\nfrom among the people, and the Covenant established in its purity."He sprang to a chair with an attitude of frenzy, in order to anticipate\nthe fatal moment by putting the index forward; and several of the party\nbegan to make ready their slaughter-weapons for immediate execution, when\nMucklewrath\'s hand was arrested by one of his companions.he said--"I hear a distant noise.""It is the rushing of the brook over the pebbles," said one."It is the sough of the wind among the bracken," said another."It is the galloping of horse," said Morton to himself, his sense of\nhearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood; "God\ngrant they may come as my deliverers!"The noise approached rapidly, and became more and more distinct."It is horse," cried Macbriar."Look out and descry who they are."cried one who had opened the window, in\nobedience to his order.A thick trampling and loud voices were heard immediately round the house.Some rose to resist, and some to escape; the doors and windows were\nforced at once, and the red coats of the troopers appeared in the\napartment."Have at the bloody rebels!--Remember Cornet Grahame!"The lights were struck down, but the dubious glare of the fire enabled\nthem to continue the fray.Several pistol-shots were fired; the whig who\nstood next to Morton received a shot as he was rising, stumbled against\nthe prisoner, whom he bore down with his weight, and lay stretched above\nhim a dying man.This accident probably saved Morton from the damage he\nmight otherwise have received in so close a struggle, where fire-arms\nwere discharged and sword-blows given for upwards of five minutes.exclaimed the well-known voice of Claverhouse;\n"look about for him, and dispatch the whig dog who is groaning there."The groans of the wounded man were silenced by\na thrust with a rapier, and Morton, disencumbered of his weight, was\nspeedily raised and in the arms of the faithful Cuddie, who blubbered for\njoy when he found that the blood with which his master was covered had\nnot flowed from his own veins.A whisper in Morton\'s ear, while his\ntrusty follower relieved him from his bonds, explained the secret of the\nvery timely appearance of the soldiers."I fell into Claverhouse\'s party when I was seeking for some o\' our ain\nfolk to help ye out o\' the hands of the whigs, sae being atween the deil\nand the deep sea, I e\'en thought it best to bring him on wi\' me, for\nhe\'ll be wearied wi\' felling folk the night, and the morn\'s a new day,\nand Lord Evandale awes ye a day in ha\'arst; and Monmouth gies quarter,\nthe dragoons tell me, for the asking.Sae haud up your heart, an\' I\'se\nwarrant we\'ll do a\' weel eneugh yet."The principal incident of the foregoing\n     Chapter was suggested by an occurrence of a similar kind, told me by\n     a gentleman, now deceased, who held an important situation in the\n     Excise, to which he had been raised by active and resolute exertions\n     in an inferior department.When employed as a supervisor on the\n     coast of Galloway, at a time when the immunities of the Isle of Man\n     rendered smuggling almost universal in that district, this gentleman\n     had the fortune to offend highly several of the leaders in the\n     contraband trade, by his zeal in serving the revenue.This rendered his situation a dangerous one, and, on more than one\n     occasion, placed his life in jeopardy.At one time in particular, as\n     he was riding after sunset on a summer evening, he came suddenly\n     upon a gang of the most desperate smugglers in that part of the\n     country.They surrounded him, without violence, but in such a manner\n     as to show that it would be resorted to if he offered resistance,\n     and gave him to understand he must spend the evening with them,\n     since they had met so happily.The officer did not attempt\n     opposition, but only asked leave to send a country lad to tell his\n     wife and family that he should be detained later than he expected.As he had to charge the boy with this message in the presence of the\n     smugglers, he could found no hope of deliverance from it, save what\n     might arise from the sharpness of the lad\'s observation, and the\n     natural anxiety and affection of his wife.But if his errand should\n     be delivered and received literally, as he was conscious the\n     smugglers expected, it was likely that it might, by suspending alarm\n     about his absence from home, postpone all search after him till it\n     might be useless.Making a merit of necessity, therefore, he\n     instructed and dispatched his messenger, and went with the\n     contraband traders, with seeming willingness, to one of their\n     ordinary haunts.He sat down at table with them, and they began to\n     drink and indulge themselves in gross jokes, while, like Mirabel in\n     the "Inconstant," their prisoner had the heavy task of receiving\n     their insolence as wit, answering their insults with good-humour,\n     and withholding from them the opportunity which they sought of\n     engaging him in a quarrel, that they might have a pretence for\n     misusing him.He succeeded for some time, but soon became satisfied\n     it was their purpose to murder him out-right, or else to beat him in\n     such a manner as scarce to leave him with life.A regard for the\n     sanctity of the Sabbath evening, which still oddly subsisted among\n     these ferocious men, amidst their habitual violation of divine and\n     social law, prevented their commencing their intended cruelty until\n     the Sabbath should be terminated.They were sitting around their\n     anxious prisoner, muttering to each other words of terrible import,\n     and watching the index of a clock, which was shortly to strike the\n     hour at which, in their apprehension, murder would become lawful,\n     when their intended victim heard a distant rustling like the wind\n     among withered leaves.It came nearer, and resembled the sound of a\n     brook in flood chafing within its banks; it came nearer yet, and was\n     plainly distinguished as the galloping of a party of horse.The\n     absence of her husband, and the account given by the boy of the\n     suspicious appearance of those with whom he had remained, had\n     induced Mrs--to apply to the neighbouring town for a party of\n     dragoons, who thus providentially arrived in time to save him from\n     extreme violence, if not from actual destruction.]Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!To all the sensual world proclaim,\n               One crowded hour of glorious life\n               Is worth an age without a name.When the desperate affray had ceased, Claverhouse commanded his soldiers\nto remove the dead bodies, to refresh themselves and their horses, and\nprepare for passing the night at the farm-house, and for marching early\nin the ensuing morning.He then turned his attention to Morton, and there\nwas politeness, and even kindness, in the manner in which he addressed\nhim."You would have saved yourself risk from both sides, Mr Morton, if you\nhad honoured my counsel yesterday morning with some attention; but I\nrespect your motives.You are a prisoner-of-war at the disposal of the\nking and council, but you shall be treated with no incivility; and I will\nbe satisfied with your parole that you will not attempt an escape."When Morton had passed his word to that effect, Claverhouse bowed\ncivilly, and, turning away from him, called for his sergeant-major."How many prisoners, Halliday, and how many killed?""Three killed in the house, sir, two cut down in the court, and one in\nthe garden--six in all; four prisoners.""Three of them armed to the teeth," answered Halliday; "one without\narms--he seems to be a preacher.""Ay--the trumpeter to the long-ear\'d rout, I suppose," replied\nClaverhouse, glancing slightly round upon his victims, "I will talk with\nhim tomorrow.Take the other three down to the yard, draw out two files,\nand fire upon them; and, d\'ye hear, make a memorandum in the orderly book\nof three rebels taken in arms and shot, with the date and name of the\nplace--Drumshinnel, I think, they call it.--Look after the preacher till\nto-morrow; as he was not armed, he must undergo a short examination.Or\nbetter, perhaps, take him before the Privy Council; I think they should\nrelieve me of a share of this disgusting drudgery.--Let Mr Morton be\ncivilly used, and see that the men look well after their horses; and let\nmy groom wash Wild-blood\'s shoulder with some vinegar, the saddle has\ntouched him a little."All these various orders,--for life and death, the securing of his\nprisoners, and the washing his charger\'s shoulder,--were given in the\nsame unmoved and equable voice, of which no accent or tone intimated that\nthe speaker considered one direction as of more importance than another.The Cameronians, so lately about to be the willing agents of a bloody\nexecution, were now themselves to undergo it.They seemed prepared alike\nfor either extremity, nor did any of them show the least sign of fear,\nwhen ordered to leave the room for the purpose of meeting instant death.Their severe enthusiasm sustained them in that dreadful moment, and they\ndeparted with a firm look and in silence, excepting that one of them, as\nhe left the apartment, looked Claverhouse full in the face, and\npronounced, with a stern and steady voice,--"Mischief shall haunt the\nviolent man!"to which Grahame only answered by a smile of contempt.They had no sooner left the room than Claverhouse applied himself to some\nfood, which one or two of his party had hastily provided, and invited\nMorton to follow his example, observing, it had been a busy day for them\nboth.Morton declined eating; for the sudden change of circumstances--the\ntransition from the verge of the grave to a prospect of life, had\noccasioned a dizzy revulsion in his whole system.But the same confused\nsensation was accompanied by a burning thirst, and he expressed his wish\nto drink."I will pledge you, with all my heart," said Claverhouse; "for here is a\nblack jack full of ale, and good it must be, if there be good in the\ncountry, for the whigs never miss to find it out.--My service to you, Mr\nMorton," he said, filling one horn of ale for himself, and handing\nanother to his prisoner.Morton raised it to his head, and was just about to drink, when the\ndischarge of carabines beneath the window, followed by a deep and hollow\ngroan, repeated twice or thrice, and more faint at each interval,\nannounced the fate of the three men who had just left them.Morton\nshuddered, and set down the untasted cup."You are but young in these matters, Mr Morton," said Claverhouse, after\nhe had very composedly finished his draught; "and I do not think the\nworse of you as a young soldier for appearing to feel them acutely.But\nhabit, duty, and necessity, reconcile men to every thing.""I trust," said Morton, "they will never reconcile me to such scenes as\nthese.""You would hardly believe," said Claverhouse in reply, "that, in the\nbeginning of my military career, I had as much aversion to seeing blood\nspilt as ever man felt; it seemed to me to be wrung from my own heart;\nand yet, if you trust one of those whig fellows, he will tell you I drink\na warm cup of it every morning before I breakfast.[Note: The author is\nuncertain whether this was ever said of Claverhouse.But it was currently\nreported of Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, another of the persecutors, that\na cup of wine placed in his hand turned to clotted blood.]But in truth,\nMr Morton, why should we care so much for death, light upon us or around\nus whenever it may?Men die daily--not a bell tolls the hour but it is\nthe death-note of some one or other; and why hesitate to shorten the span\nof others, or take over-anxious care to prolong our own?It is all a\nlottery--when the hour of midnight came, you were to die--it has struck,\nyou are alive and safe, and the lot has fallen on those fellows who were\nto murder you.It is not the expiring pang that is worth thinking of in\nan event that must happen one day, and may befall us on any given\nmoment--it is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him, like the\nlong train of light that follows the sunken sun--that is all which is\nworth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave or the\nignoble.When I think of death, Mr Morton, as a thing worth thinking of,\nit is in the hope of pressing one day some well-fought and hard-won\nfield of battle, and dying with the shout of victory in my ear--that\nwould be worth dying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for!"At the moment when Grahame delivered these sentiments, his eye glancing\nwith the martial enthusiasm which formed such a prominent feature in his\ncharacter, a gory figure, which seemed to rise out of the floor of the\napartment, stood upright before him, and presented the wild person and\nhideous features of the maniac so often mentioned.His face, where it was\nnot covered with blood-streaks, was ghastly pale, for the hand of death\nwas on him.He bent upon Claverhouse eyes, in which the grey light of\ninsanity still twinkled, though just about to flit for ever, and\nexclaimed, with his usual wildness of ejaculation, "Wilt thou trust in\nthy bow and in thy spear, in thy steed and in thy banner?And shall not\nGod visit thee for innocent blood?--Wilt thou glory in thy wisdom, and in\nthy courage, and in thy might?And shall not the Lord judge thee?--Behold\nthe princes, for whom thou hast sold thy soul to the destroyer, shall be\nremoved from their place, and banished to other lands, and their names\nshall be a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse.And thou, who hast partaken of the wine-cup of fury, and hast been\ndrunken and mad because thereof, the wish of thy heart shall be granted\nto thy loss, and the hope of thine own pride shall destroy thee.I summon\nthee, John Grahame, to appear before the tribunal of God, to answer for\nthis innocent blood, and the seas besides which thou hast shed."He drew his right hand across his bleeding face, and held it up to heaven\nas he uttered these words, which he spoke very loud, and then added more\nfaintly, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge\nthe blood of thy saints!"As he uttered the last word, he fell backwards without an attempt to save\nhimself, and was a dead man ere his head touched the floor.Morton was much shocked at this extraordinary scene, and the prophecy of\nthe dying man, which tallied so strangely with the wish which Claverhouse\nhad just expressed; and he often thought of it afterwards when that wish\nseemed to be accomplished.Two of the dragoons who were in the apartment,\nhardened as they were, and accustomed to such scenes, showed great\nconsternation at the sudden apparition, the event, and the words which\npreceded it.At the first instant of\nMucklewrath\'s appearance, he had put his hand to his pistol, but on\nseeing the situation of the wounded wretch, he immediately withdrew it,\nand listened with great composure to his dying exclamation.When he dropped, Claverhouse asked, in an unconcerned tone of voice--"How\ncame the fellow here?--Speak, you staring fool!"he added, addressing the\nnearest dragoon, "unless you would have me think you such a poltroon as\nto fear a dying man."The dragoon crossed himself, and replied with a faltering voice,--"That\nthe dead fellow had escaped their notice when they removed the other\nbodies, as he chanced to have fallen where a cloak or two had been flung\naside, and covered him.""Take him away now, then, you gaping idiot, and see that he does not bite\nyou, to put an old proverb to shame.--This is a new incident, Mr.Morton,\nthat dead men should rise and push us from our stools.I must see that my\nblackguards grind their swords sharper; they used not to do their work so\nslovenly.--But we have had a busy day; they are tired, and their blades\nblunted with their bloody work; and I suppose you, Mr Morton, as well as\nI, are well disposed for a few hours\' repose."So saying, he yawned, and taking a candle which a soldier had placed\nready, saluted Morton courteously, and walked to the apartment which had\nbeen prepared for him.Morton was also accommodated, for the evening, with a separate room.Being left alone, his first occupation was the returning thanks to Heaven\nfor redeeming him from danger, even through the instrumentality of those\nwho seemed his most dangerous enemies; he also prayed sincerely for the\nDivine assistance in guiding his course through times which held out so\nmany dangers and so many errors.And having thus poured out his spirit in\nprayer before the Great Being who gave it, he betook himself to the\nrepose which he so much required.The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met,\n               The judges all ranged--a terrible show!So deep was the slumber which succeeded the agitation and embarrassment\nof the preceding day, that Morton hardly knew where he was when it was\nbroken by the tramp of horses, the hoarse voice of men, and the wild\nsound of the trumpets blowing the _reveille_.The sergeant-major\nimmediately afterwards came to summon him, which he did in a very\nrespectful manner, saying the General (for Claverhouse now held that\nrank) hoped for the pleasure of his company upon the road.In some\nsituations an intimation is a command, and Morton considered that the\npresent occasion was one of these.He waited upon Claverhouse as speedily\nas he could, found his own horse saddled for his use, and Cuddie in\nattendance.Both were deprived of their fire-arms, though they seemed,\notherwise, rather to make part of the troop than of the prisoners; and\nMorton was permitted to retain his sword, the wearing which was, in those\ndays, the distinguishing mark of a gentleman.Claverhouse seemed also to\ntake pleasure in riding beside him, in conversing with him, and in\nconfounding his ideas when he attempted to appreciate his real character.The gentleness and urbanity of that officer\'s general manners, the high\nand chivalrous sentiments of military devotion which he occasionally\nexpressed, his deep and accurate insight into the human bosom, demanded\nat once the approbation and the wonder of those who conversed with him;\nwhile, on the other hand, his cold indifference to military violence and\ncruelty seemed altogether inconsistent with the social, and even\nadmirable qualities which he displayed.Morton could not help, in his\nheart, contrasting him with Balfour of Burley; and so deeply did the idea\nimpress him, that he dropped a hint of it as they rode together at some\ndistance from the troop."You are right," said Claverhouse, with a smile; "you are very right--we\nare both fanatics; but there is some distinction between the fanaticism\nof honour and that of dark and sullen superstition.""Yet you both shed blood without mercy or remorse," said Morton, who\ncould not suppress his feelings."Surely," said Claverhouse, with the same composure; "but of what\nkind?--There is a difference, I trust, between the blood of learned and\nreverend prelates and scholars, of gallant soldiers and noble gentlemen,\nand the red puddle that stagnates in the veins of psalm-singing\nmechanics, crackbrained demagogues, and sullen boors;--some distinction,\nin short, between spilling a flask of generous wine, and dashing down a\ncan full of base muddy ale?""Your distinction is too nice for my comprehension," replied Morton."God\ngives every spark of life--that of the peasant as well as of the prince;\nand those who destroy his work recklessly or causelessly, must answer in\neither case.What right, for example, have I to General Grahame\'s\nprotection now, more than when I first met him?""And narrowly escaped the consequences, you would say?"answered\nClaverhouse--"why, I will answer you frankly.Then I thought I had to do\nwith the son of an old roundheaded rebel, and the nephew of a sordid\npresbyterian laird; now I know your points better, and there is that\nabout you which I respect in an enemy as much as I like in a friend.I\nhave learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting, and I\ntrust that you have found that my construction of the information has not\nbeen unfavourable to you.""But yet," said Morton--\n\n"But yet," interrupted Grahame, taking up the word, "you would say you\nwere the same when I first met you that you are now?True; but then, how\ncould I know that?though, by the by, even my reluctance to suspend your\nexecution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation.""Do you expect, General," said Morton, "that I ought to be particularly\ngrateful for such a mark of your esteem?""I tell you I thought\nyou a different sort of person."I have half a mind," said Claverhouse, "to contrive you should have six\nmonths\' imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure.His chapters\ninspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself.And the noble\ncanon, with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful\nexpressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and high-bred knight,\nof whom it was a pity to see the fall, such was his loyalty to his king,\npure faith to his religion, hardihood towards his enemy, and fidelity to\nhis lady-love!--Ah, benedicite!how he will mourn over the fall of such a\npearl of knighthood, be it on the side he happens to favour, or on the\nother.But, truly, for sweeping from the face of the earth some few\nhundreds of villain churls, who are born but to plough it, the high-born\nand inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathy,--as little, or\nless, perhaps, than John Grahame of Claverhouse.""There is one ploughman in your possession, General, for whom," said\nMorton, "in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which\nsome philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier, I would\nhumbly request your favour.""You mean," said Claverhouse, looking at a memorandum book, "one\nHatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg.Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie\nHeadrigg--here I have him.O, never fear him, if he will be but\ntractable.The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his\naccount some time ago.He is to marry their waiting-maid, I think.He\nwill be allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good\nfortune.""He has no ambition to be a martyr, I believe," said Morton."\'Tis the better for him," said Claverhouse."But, besides, although the\nfellow had more to answer for, I should stand his friend, for the sake of\nthe blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last\nnight, when seeking assistance for you.I never desert any man who trusts\nme with such implicit confidence.But, to deal sincerely with you, he has\nbeen long in our eye.--Here, Halliday; bring me up the black book."The sergeant, having committed to his commander this ominous record of\nthe disaffected, which was arranged in alphabetical order, Claverhouse,\nturning over the leaves as he rode on, began to read names as they\noccurred."Gumblegumption, a minister, aged 50, indulged, close, sly, and so\nforth--Pooh!pooh!--He--He--I have him here--Heathercat; outlawed--a\npreacher--a zealous Cameronian--keeps a conventicle among the Campsie\nhills--Tush!--O, here is Headrigg--Cuthbert; his mother a bitter\npuritan--himself a simple fellow--like to be forward in action, but of\nno genius for plots--more for the hand than the head, and might be drawn\nto the right side, but for his attachment to"--(Here Claverhouse looked\nat Morton, and then shut the book and changed his tone.)"Faithful and\ntrue are words never thrown away upon me, Mr Morton.You may depend on\nthe young man\'s safety.""Does it not revolt a mind like yours," said Morton, "to follow a system\nwhich is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure\nindividuals?""You do not suppose we take the trouble?""The curates, for their own sakes, willingly collect all these materials\nfor their own regulation in each parish; they know best the black sheep\nof the flock."Will you favour me by imparting it?""Willingly," said Claverhouse; "it can signify little, for you cannot\navenge yourself on the curate, as you will probably leave Scotland for\nsome time."Morton felt an involuntary\nshudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land;\nbut ere he answered, Claverhouse proceeded to read, "Henry Morton, son of\nSilas Morton, Colonel of horse for the Scottish Parliament, nephew and\napparent heir of Morton of Milnwood--imperfectly educated, but with\nspirit beyond his years--excellent at all exercises--indifferent to forms\nof religion, but seems to incline to the presbyterian--has high-flown and\ndangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech, and hovers between\na latitudinarian and an enthusiast.Much admired and followed by the\nyouth of his own age--modest, quiet, and unassuming in manner, but in his\nheart peculiarly bold and intractable.He is--Here follow three red\ncrosses, Mr Morton, which signify triply dangerous.You see how important\na person you are.--But what does this fellow want?"A horseman rode up as he spoke, and gave a letter.Claverhouse glanced it\nover, laughed scornfully, bade him tell his master to send his prisoners\nto Edinburgh, for there was no answer; and, as the man turned back, said\ncontemptuously to Morton--"Here is an ally of yours deserted from you, or\nrather, I should say, an ally of your good friend Burley--Hear how he\nsets forth--\'Dear Sir,\' (I wonder when we were such intimates,)\'may it\nplease your Excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the\nvictory\'--hum--hum--\'blessed his Majesty\'s army.I pray you to understand\nI have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives, and have\nalready several prisoners,\' and so forth.Subscribed Basil Olifant--You\nknow the fellow by name, I suppose?""A relative of Lady Margaret Bellenden," replied Morton, "is he not?""Ay," replied Grahame, "and heir-male of her father\'s family, though a\ndistant one, and moreover a suitor to the fair Edith, though discarded as\nan unworthy one; but, above all, a devoted admirer of the estate of\nTillietudlem, and all thereunto belonging.""He takes an ill mode of recommending himself," said Morton, suppressing\nhis feelings, "to the family at Tillietudlem, by corresponding with our\nunhappy party.""O, this precious Basil will turn cat in pan with any man!""He was displeased with the government, because they would\nnot overturn in his favour a settlement of the late Earl of Torwood, by\nwhich his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter; he was\ndispleased with Lady Margaret, because she avowed no desire for his\nalliance, and with the pretty Edith, because she did not like his tall\nungainly person.So he held a close correspondence with Burley, and\nraised his followers with the purpose of helping him, providing always he\nneeded no help, that is, if you had beat us yesterday.And now the rascal\npretends he was all the while proposing the King\'s service, and, for\naught I know, the council will receive his pretext for current coin, for\nhe knows how to make friends among them--and a dozen scores of poor\nvagabond fanatics will be shot, or hanged, while this cunning scoundrel\nlies hid under the double cloak of loyalty, well-lined with the fox-fur\nof hypocrisy."With conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way,\nClaverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to Morton, and\ntreating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner; so\nthat, however uncertain of his fate, the hours he passed in the company\nof this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his\nimagination, and the depth of his knowledge of human nature, that since\nthe period of his becoming a prisoner of war, which relieved him at once\nfrom the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the\ninsurgents, and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment, his\nhours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having\ncommenced actor in public life.He was now, with respect to his fortune,\nlike a rider who has flung his reins on the horse\'s neck, and, while he\nabandoned himself to circumstances, was at least relieved from the task\nof attempting to direct them.In this mood he journeyed on, the number of\nhis companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse\nwho came in from every quarter of the country, bringing with them, for\nthe most part, the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power."Our council," said Claverhouse, "being resolved, I suppose, to testify\nby their present exultation the extent of their former terror, have\ndecreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives; but as\nI do not quite approve the taste of it, I am willing to avoid my own part\nin the show, and, at the same time, to save you from yours."So saying, he gave up the command of the forces to Allan, (now a\nLieutenant-colonel,) and, turning his horse into a by-lane, rode into the\ncity privately, accompanied by Morton and two or three servants.When\nClaverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the\nCanongate, he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment, with an\nintimation, that his parole confined him to it for the present.After about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange\nvicissitudes of his late life, the attention of Morton was summoned to\nthe window by a great noise in the street beneath.Trumpets, drums, and\nkettle-drums, contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble,\nand apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal\nattitude which Claverhouse had mentioned.The magistrates of the city,\nattended by their guard of halberds, had met the victors with their\nwelcome at the gate of the city, and now preceded them as a part of the\nprocession.The next object was two heads borne upon pikes; and before\neach bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers,\nwhich were, by the brutal mockery of those who bore them, often\napproached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or\nprayer.These bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at\nBothwell Bridge.After them came a cart led by the executioner\'s\nassistant, in which were placed Macbriar, and other two prisoners, who\nseemed of the same profession.They were bareheaded, and strongly bound,\nyet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay, and\nappeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions, of\nwhich the bloody evidences were carried before them, or by dread of their\nown approaching execution, which these preliminaries so plainly\nindicated.Behind these prisoners, thus held up to public infamy and derision, came\na body of horse, brandishing their broadswords, and filling the wide\nstreet with acclamations, which were answered by the tumultuous outcries\nand shouts of the rabble, who, in every considerable town, are too happy\nin being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them\ntogether.In the rear of these troopers came the main body of the\nprisoners, at the head of whom were some of their leaders, who were\ntreated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult.Several\nwere placed on horseback with their faces to the animal\'s tail; others\nwere chained to long bars of iron, which they were obliged to support in\ntheir hands, like the galleyslaves in Spain when travelling to the port\nwhere they are to be put on shipboard.The heads of others who had fallen\nwere borne in triumph before the survivors, some on pikes and halberds,\nsome in sacks, bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on\nthe outside.Such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession, who\nseemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of\nthe condemned heretics in an auto-da-fe.[Note: David Hackston of\nRathillet, who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of\nAir\'s-Moss, in which the celebrated Cameron fell, was, on entering\nEdinburgh, "by order of the Council, received by the Magistrates at the\nWatergate, and set on a horse\'s bare back with his face to the tail, and\nthe other three laid on a goad of iron, and carried up the street, Mr\nCameron\'s head being on a halberd before them."]Behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds,\nsome retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause\nfor which they suffered captivity, and were about to give a still more\nbloody testimony; others seemed pale, dispirited, dejected, questioning\nin their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which Providence\nseemed to have disowned, and looking about for some avenue through which\nthey might escape from the consequences of their rashness.Others there\nwere who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject, or of\nentertaining either hope, confidence, or fear, but who, foaming with\nthirst and fatigue, stumbled along like over-driven oxen, lost to every\nthing but their present sense of wretchedness, and without having any\ndistinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture.These unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers, and behind\nthem came the main body of the cavalry, whose military music resounded\nback from the high houses on each side of the street, and mingled with\ntheir own songs of jubilee and triumph, and the wild shouts of the\nrabble.Morton felt himself heart-sick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle,\nand recognised in the bloody heads, and still more miserable and agonized\nfeatures of the living sufferers, faces which had been familiar to him\nduring the brief insurrection.He sunk down in a chair in a bewildered\nand stupified state, from which he was awakened by the voice of Cuddie.said the poor fellow, his teeth chattering like a\npair of nut-crackers, his hair erect like boar\'s bristles, and his face\nas pale as that of a corpse--"Lord forgie us, sir!we maun instantly gang\nbefore the Council!--O Lord, what made them send for a puir bodie like\nme, sae mony braw lords and gentles!--and there\'s my mither come on the\nlang tramp frae Glasgow to see to gar me testify, as she ca\'s it, that is\nto say, confess and be hanged; but deil tak me if they mak sic a guse o\'\nCuddie, if I can do better.But here\'s Claverhouse himsell--the Lord\npreserve and forgie us, I say anes mair!""You must immediately attend the Council Mr Morton," said Claverhouse,\nwho entered while Cuddie spoke, "and your servant must go with you.You\nneed be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself\npersonally.But I warn you that you will see something that will give you\nmuch pain, and from which I would willingly have saved you, if I had\npossessed the power.It will be readily supposed that Morton did not venture to dispute this\ninvitation, however unpleasant."I must apprise you," said the latter, as he led the way down stairs,\n"that you will get off cheap; and so will your servant, provided he can\nkeep his tongue quiet."Cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy."Deil a fear o\' me," said he, "an my mither disna pit her finger in the\npie."At that moment his shoulder was seized by old Mause, who had contrived to\nthrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment."O, hinny, hinny!"said she to Cuddie, hanging upon his neck, "glad and\nproud, and sorry and humbled am I, a\'in ane and the same instant, to see\nmy bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in\ncouncil, as he did with his weapon in the field!""Whisht, whisht, mither!""Odd, ye daft wife,\nis this a time to speak o\' thae things?I tell ye I\'ll testify naething\neither ae gate or another.I hae spoken to Mr Poundtext, and I\'ll tak the\ndeclaration, or whate\'er they ca\'it, and we\'re a\' to win free off if we\ndo that--he\'s gotten life for himsell and a\' his folk, and that\'s a\nminister for my siller; I like nane o\' your sermons that end in a psalm\nat the Grassmarket."[Note: Then the place of public execution.]"O, Cuddie, man, laith wad I be they suld hurt ye," said old Mause,\ndivided grievously between the safety of her son\'s soul and that of his\nbody; "but mind, my bonny bairn, ye hae battled for the faith, and dinna\nlet the dread o\' losing creature-comforts withdraw ye frae the gude\nfight.""Hout tout, mither," replied Cuddie, "I hae fought e\'en ower muckle\nalready, and, to speak plain, I\'m wearied o\'the trade.I hae swaggered\nwi\' a\' thae arms, and muskets, and pistols, buffcoats, and bandoliers,\nlang eneugh, and I like the pleughpaidle a hantle better.I ken naething\nsuld gar a man fight, (that\'s to say, when he\'s no angry,) by and\nout-taken the dread o\'being hanged or killed if he turns back.""But, my dear Cuddie," continued the persevering Mause, "your bridal\ngarment--Oh, hinny, dinna sully the marriage garment!""Awa, awa, mither," replied.Cuddie; "dinna ye see the folks waiting for\nme?--Never fear me--I ken how to turn this far better than ye do--for\nye\'re bleezing awa about marriage, and the job is how we are to win by\nhanging."So saying, he extricated himself out of his mother\'s embraces, and\nrequested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place\nof examination without delay.He had been already preceded by Claverhouse\nand Morton.The Privy Council of Scotland, in whom the practice since the union of\nthe crowns vested great judicial powers, as well as the general\nsuperintendence of the executive department, was met in the ancient dark\nGothic room, adjoining to the House of Parliament in Edinburgh, when\nGeneral Grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the\ncouncil table."You have brought us a leash of game to-day, General," said a nobleman of\nhigh place amongst them."Here is a craven to confess--a cock of the game\nto stand at bay--and what shall I call the third, General?""Without further metaphor, I will entreat your Grace to call him a person\nin whom I am specially interested," replied Claverhouse.said the nobleman, lolling out a tongue\nwhich was at all times too big for his mouth, and accommodating his\ncoarse features to a sneer, to which they seemed to be familiar."Yes, please your Grace, a whig; as your Grace was in 1641," replied\nClaverhouse, with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility."He has you there, I think, my Lord Duke," said one of the Privy\nCouncillors."Ay, ay," returned the Duke, laughing, "there\'s no speaking to him since\nDrumclog--but come, bring in the prisoners--and do you, Mr Clerk, read\nthe record."The clerk read forth a bond, in which General Grahame of Claverhouse and\nLord Evandale entered themselves securities, that Henry Morton, younger\nof Milnwood, should go abroad and remain in foreign parts, until his\nMajesty\'s pleasure was further known, in respect of the said Henry\nMorton\'s accession to the late rebellion, and that under penalty of life\nand limb to the said Henry Morton, and of ten thousand marks to each of\nhis securities."Do you accept of the King\'s mercy upon these terms, Mr Morton?"said the\nDuke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council."I have no other choice, my lord," replied Morton.Morton did so without reply, conscious that, in the circumstances of his\ncase, it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily.Macbriar,\nwho was at the same instant brought to the foot of the council-table,\nbound upon a chair, for his weakness prevented him from standing, beheld\nMorton in the act of what he accounted apostasy."He hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant!"he exclaimed, with a deep groan--"A fallen star!--a fallen star!""Hold your peace, sir," said the Duke, "and keep your ain breath to cool\nyour ain porridge--ye\'ll find them scalding hot, I promise you.--Call in\nthe other fellow, who has some common sense.One sheep will leap the\nditch when another goes first."Cuddie was introduced unbound, but under the guard of two halberdiers,\nand placed beside Macbriar at the foot of the table.The poor fellow cast\na piteous look around him, in which were mingled awe for the great men in\nwhose presence he stood, and compassion for his fellow-sufferers, with no\nsmall fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself.He\nmade his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence, and then\nawaited the opening of the awful scene."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Brigg?"was the first question which\nwas thundered in his ears.Cuddie meditated a denial, but had sense enough, upon reflection, to\ndiscover that the truth would be too strong for him; so he replied, with\ntrue Caledonian indirectness of response, "I\'ll no say but it may be\npossible that I might hae been there.""Answer directly, you knave--yes, or no?--You know you were there.""It\'s no for me to contradict your Lordship\'s Grace\'s honour," said\nCuddie."Once more, sir, were you there?--yes, or no?""Dear stir," again replied Cuddie, "how can ane mind preceesely where\nthey hae been a\' the days o\' their life?""Speak out, you scoundrel," said General Dalzell, "or I\'ll dash your\nteeth out with my dudgeonhaft!--Do you think we can stand here all day to\nbe turning and dodging with you, like greyhounds after a hare?"[Note:\nThe General is said to have struck one of the captive whigs, when under\nexamination, with the hilt of his sabre, so that the blood gushed out.The provocation for this unmanly violence was, that the prisoner had\ncalled the fierce veteran "a Muscovy beast, who used to roast men."Dalzell had been long in the Russian service, which in those days was no\nschool of humanity.]"Aweel, then," said Cuddie, "since naething else will please ye, write\ndown that I cannot deny but I was there.""Well, sir," said the Duke, "and do you think that the rising upon that\noccasion was rebellion or not?""I\'m no just free to gie my opinion, stir," said the cautious captive,\n"on what might cost my neck; but I doubt it will be very little better.""Just than rebellion, as your honour ca\'s it," replied Cuddie."Well, sir, that\'s speaking to the purpose," replied his Grace."And are\nyou content to accept of the King\'s pardon for your guilt as a rebel, and\nto keep the church, and pray for the King?""Blithely, stir," answered the unscrupulous Cuddie; "and drink his health\ninto the bargain, when the ale\'s gude.""Egad," said the Duke, "this is a hearty cock.--What brought you into\nsuch a scrape, mine honest friend?""Just ill example, stir," replied the prisoner, "and a daft auld jaud of\na mither, wi\' reverence to your Grace\'s honour.""Why, God-a-mercy, my friend," replied the Duke, "take care of bad advice\nanother time; I think you are not likely to commit treason on your own\nscore.--Make out his free pardon, and bring forward the rogue in the\nchair."Macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Bridge?"was, in like manner,\ndemanded of him."I was," answered the prisoner, in a bold and resolute tone."I was not--I went in my calling as a preacher of God\'s word, to\nencourage them that drew the sword in His cause.""In other words, to aid and abet the rebels?""Thou hast spoken it," replied the prisoner."Well, then," continued the interrogator, "let us know if you saw John\nBalfour of Burley among the party?--I presume you know him?""I bless God that I do know him," replied Macbriar; "he is a zealous and\na sincere Christian.""And when and where did you last see this pious personage?""I am here to answer for myself," said Macbriar, in the same dauntless\nmanner, "and not to endanger others.""We shall know," said Dalzell, "how to make you find your tongue.""If you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle," answered\nLauderdale, "he will find it without you.--Come, laddie, speak while the\nplay is good--you\'re too young to bear the burden will be laid on you\nelse.""I defy you," retorted Macbriar."This has not been the first of my\nimprisonments or of my sufferings; and, young as I may be, I have lived\nlong enough to know how to die when I am called upon.""Ay, but there are some things which must go before an easy death, if you\ncontinue obstinate," said Lauderdale, and rung a small silver bell which\nwas placed before him on the table.A dark crimson curtain, which covered a sort of niche, or Gothic recess\nin the wall, rose at the signal, and displayed the public executioner, a\ntall, grim, and hideous man, having an oaken table before him, on which\nlay thumb-screws, and an iron case, called the Scottish boot, used in\nthose tyrannical days to torture accused persons.Morton, who was\nunprepared for this ghastly apparition, started when the curtain arose,\nbut Macbriar\'s nerves were more firm.He gazed upon the horrible\napparatus with much composure; and if a touch of nature called the blood\nfrom his cheek for a second, resolution sent it back to his brow with\ngreater energy.said Lauderdale, in a low, stern voice,\nalmost sinking into a whisper."He is, I suppose," replied Macbriar, "the infamous executioner of your\nbloodthirsty commands upon the persons of God\'s people.He and you are\nequally beneath my regard; and, I bless God, I no more fear what he can\ninflict than what you can command.Flesh and blood may shrink under the\nsufferings you can doom me to, and poor frail nature may shed tears, or\nsend forth cries; but I trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of\nages.""Do your duty," said the Duke to the executioner.The fellow advanced, and asked, with a harsh and discordant voice, upon\nwhich of the prisoner\'s limbs he should first employ his engine."Let him choose for himself," said the Duke; "I should like to oblige him\nin any thing that is reasonable.""Since you leave it to me," said the prisoner, stretching forth his right\nleg, "take the best--I willingly bestow it in the cause for which I\nsuffer."[Note: This was the reply actually made by James Mitchell when\nsubjected to the torture of the boot, for an attempt to assassinate\nArchbishop Sharpe.]The executioner, with the help of his assistants, enclosed the leg and\nknee within the tight iron boot, or case, and then placing a wedge of the\nsame metal between the knee and the edge of the machine, took a mallet in\nhis hand, and stood waiting for farther orders.A well-dressed man, by\nprofession a surgeon, placed himself by the other side of the prisoner\'s\nchair, bared the prisoner\'s arm, and applied his thumb to the pulse in\norder to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient.When these preparations were made, the President of the Council repeated\nwith the same stern voice the question, "When and where did you last see\nJohn Balfour of Burley?"The prisoner, instead of replying to him, turned his eyes to heaven as if\nimploring Divine strength, and muttered a few words, of which the last\nwere distinctly audible, "Thou hast said thy people shall be willing in\nthe day of thy power!"The Duke of Lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to\ncollect their suffrages, and, judging from their mute signs, gave on his\nown part a nod to the executioner, whose mallet instantly descended on\nthe wedge, and, forcing it between the knee and the iron boot, occasioned\nthe most exquisite pain, as was evident from the flush which instantly\ntook place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer.The fellow then\nagain raised his weapon, and stood prepared to give a second blow."Will you yet say," repeated the Duke of Lauderdale, "where and when you\nlast parted from Balfour of Burley?""You have my answer," said the sufferer resolutely, and the second blow\nfell.The third and fourth succeeded; but at the fifth, when a larger\nwedge had been introduced, the prisoner set up a scream of agony.Morton, whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty, could\nbear no longer, and, although unarmed and himself in great danger, was\nspringing forward, when Claverhouse, who observed his emotion, withheld\nhim by force, laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth,\nwhile he whispered, "For God\'s sake, think where you are!"This movement, fortunately for him, was observed by no other of the\ncouncillors, whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before\nthem."He is gone," said the surgeon--"he has fainted, my Lords, and human\nnature can endure no more.""Release him," said the Duke; and added, turning to Dalzell, "He will\nmake an old proverb good, for he\'ll scarce ride to-day, though he has had\nhis boots on."Ay, dispatch his sentence, and have done with him; we have plenty of\ndrudgery behind."Strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of\nthe unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a\nreturn of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a\ntraitor taken in the act of open rebellion, and adjudged him to be\ncarried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged\nby the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and\ndisposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure\nof the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage\nas the rest of their conduct.The heads of the preachers were frequently\nexposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the\nattitude of prayer.When the celebrated Richard Cameron\'s head was\nexposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one\nwho lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.]and all\nand sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his\nMajesty\'s use."Doomster," he continued, "repeat the sentence to the prisoner."The office of Doomster was in those days, and till a much later period,\nheld by the executioner in commendam, with his ordinary functions.[Note:\nSee a note on the subject of this office in the Heart of Mid-Lothian.]The duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of\nthe law as pronounced by the judge, which acquired an additional and\nhorrid emphasis from the recollection, that the hateful personage by whom\nit was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced.Macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first\npronounced by the Lord President of the Council; but he was sufficiently\nrecovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the\nharsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it, and at the\nlast awful words, "And this I pronounce for doom," he answered boldly--\n"My Lords, I thank you for the only favour I looked for, or would accept\nat your hands, namely, that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass,\nwhich has this day sustained your cruelty, to this hasty end.It were\nindeed little to me whether I perish on the gallows or in the\nprison-house; but if death, following close on what I have this day\nsuffered, had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage, many might\nhave lost the sight how a Christian man can suffer in the good cause.For\nthe rest, I forgive you, my Lords, for what you have appointed and I have\nsustained--And why should I not?--Ye send me to a happy exchange--to the\ncompany of angels and the spirits of the just, for that of frail dust\nand ashes--Ye send me from darkness into day--from mortality to\nimmortality--and, in a word, from earth to heaven!--If the thanks,\ntherefore, and pardon of a dying man can do you good, take them at my\nhand, and may your last moments be as happy as mine!"As he spoke thus, with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph, he was\nwithdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment, and executed\nwithin half an hour, dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his\nwhole life had evinced.The Council broke up, and Morton found himself again in the carriage with\nGeneral Grahame."Marvellous firmness and gallantry!"said Morton, as he reflected upon\nMacbriar\'s conduct; "what a pity it is that with such self-devotion and\nheroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect!""You mean," said Claverhouse, "his resolution to condemn you to death?--\nTo that he would have reconciled himself by a single text; for example,\n\'And Phinehas arose and executed judgment,\' or something to the same\npurpose.--But wot ye where you are now bound, Mr Morton?""We are on the road to Leith, I observe," answered Morton."Can I not be\npermitted to see my friends ere I leave my native land?""Your uncle," replied Grahame, "has been spoken to, and declines visiting\nyou.The good gentleman is terrified, and not without some reason, that\nthe crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and\ntenements--he sends you, however, his blessing, and a small sum of money.Major Bellenden is at\nTillietudlem putting matters in order.The scoundrels have made great\nhavoc there with Lady Margaret\'s muniments of antiquity, and have\ndesecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the Throne of his most\nSacred Majesty.Is there any one else whom you would wish to see?"Morton sighed deeply as he answered, "No--it would avail nothing.--But my\npreparations,--small as they are, some must be necessary.""They are all ready for you," said the General."Lord Evandale has\nanticipated all you wish.Here is a packet from him with letters of\nrecommendation for the court of the Stadtholder Prince of Orange, to\nwhich I have added one or two.I made my first campaigns under him, and\nfirst saw fire at the battle of Seneff.Claverhouse\ngreatly distinguished himself in this action, and was made Captain.]There are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants, and more will\nbe sent when you require it."Morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and\nconfused look, so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment."He shall be taken care of, and replaced, if it be practicable, in the\nservice of Lady Margaret Bellenden; I think he will hardly neglect the\nparade of the feudal retainers, or go a-whigging a second time.--But here\nwe are upon the quay, and the boat waits you."A boat waited for Captain Morton, with\nthe trunks and baggage belonging to his rank.Claverhouse shook him by\nthe hand, and wished him good fortune, and a happy return to Scotland in\nquieter times."I shall never forget," he said, "the gallantry of your behaviour to my\nfriend Evandale, in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid\nhim out of their way."As Morton descended the pier\nto get into the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very\nsmall space.The person who gave it seemed much muffled\nup; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the\ncrowd.The incident awakened Morton\'s curiosity; and when he found\nhimself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his\ncompanions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an\nopportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him.It ran\nthus:--"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his\nenemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the\nErastian interest.These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel.--I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger.But turn from\nthat folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall\nmy hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence\nhath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of\nruin and confiscation.The resistance of their stronghold was the main\ncause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon\nmy soul to visit it upon them.Wherefore, think of her no more, but join\nwith our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this\nmiserable land to save and to relieve her.There is an honest remnant in\nHolland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance.Join thyself unto\nthem like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou\nwilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own\nworking.Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard,\nthou wilt at all times hear of my in-comings and out-goings, by enquiring\nafter Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular\nChristian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff,\nwhere Niel Blane entertaineth guests.So much from him who hopes to hear\nagain from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving\nagainst sin.Keep thy sword\ngirded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who\nshall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw,\nand malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments\ndyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house\nof Joseph for fire.I am he that hath written it, whose hand hath been on\nthe mighty in the waste field."This extraordinary letter was subscribed J. B. of B.; but the signature\nof these initials was not necessary for pointing out to Morton that it\ncould come from no other than Burley.It gave him new occasion to admire\nthe indomitable spirit of this man, who, with art equal to his courage\nand obstinacy, was even now endeavouring to re-establish the web of\nconspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces.But he felt no sort\nof desire, in the present moment, to sustain a correspondence which must\nbe perilous, or to renew an association, which, in so many ways, had been\nnearly fatal to him.The threats which Burley held out against the family\nof Bellenden, he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account\nof their defence of Tillietudlem; and nothing seemed less likely than\nthat, at the very moment of their party being victorious, their fugitive\nand distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their\nfortunes.Morton, however, hesitated for an instant, whether he should not send\nthe Major or Lord Evandale intimation of Burley\'s threats.Upon\nconsideration, he thought he could not do so without betraying his\nconfidential correspondence; for to warn them of his menaces would have\nserved little purpose, unless he had given them a clew to prevent them,\nby apprehending his person; while, by doing so, he deemed he should\ncommit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed\nalmost imaginary.Upon mature consideration, therefore, he tore the\nletter, having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the\nwriter was to be heard of, and threw the fragments into the sea.While Morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored, and the white\nsails swelled out before a favourable north-west wind.The ship leaned\nher side to the gale, and went roaring through the waves, leaving a long\nand rippling furrow to track her course.The city and port from which he\nhad sailed became undistinguishable in the distance; the hills by which\nthey were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky, and Morton was\nseparated for several years from the land of his nativity.It is fortunate for tale-tellers that they are not tied down like\ntheatrical writers to the unities of time and place, but may conduct\ntheir personages to Athens and Thebes at their pleasure, and bring them\nback at their convenience.Time, to use Rosalind\'s simile, has hitherto\npaced with the hero of our tale; for betwixt Morton\'s first appearance as\na competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for Holland hardly\ntwo months elapsed.Years, however, glided away ere we find it possible\nto resume the thread of our narrative, and Time must be held to have\ngalloped over the interval.Craving, therefore, the privilege of my cast,\nI entreat the reader\'s attention to the continuation of the narrative, as\nit starts from a new era, being the year immediately subsequent to the\nBritish Revolution.Scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a\nchange of dynasty, and, through the prudent tolerance of King William,\nhad narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war.Agriculture\nbegan to revive, and men, whose minds had been disturbed by the violent\npolitical concussions, and the general change of government in Church and\nState, had begun to recover their ordinary temper, and to give the usual\nattention to their own private affairs, in lieu of discussing those of\nthe public.The Highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of\nthings, and were in arms in a considerable body under the Viscount of\nDundee, whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of Grahame of\nClaverhouse.But the usual state of the Highlands was so unruly that\ntheir being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the\ngeneral tranquillity of the country, so long as their disorders were\nconfined within their own frontiers.In the Lowlands, the Jacobites, now\nthe undermost party, had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open\nresistance, and were, in their turn, driven to hold private meetings, and\nform associations for mutual defence, which the government termed\ntreason, while they cried out persecution.The triumphant Whigs, while they re-established Presbytery as the\nnational religion, and assigned to the General Assemblies of the Kirk\ntheir natural influence, were very far from going the lengths which the\nCameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under\nCharles and James loudly demanded.They would listen to no proposal for\nre-establishing the Solemn League and Covenant; and those who had\nexpected to find in King William a zealous Covenanted Monarch, were\ngrievously disappointed when he intimated, with the phlegm peculiar to\nhis country, his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were\nconsistent with the safety of the State.The principles of indulgence\nthus espoused and gloried in by the Government gave great offence to the\nmore violent party, who condemned them as diametrically contrary to\nScripture,--for which narrow-spirited doctrine they cited various texts,\nall, as it may well be supposed, detached from their context, and most of\nthem derived from the charges given to the Jews in the Old Testament\ndispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the Promised Land.They also\nmurmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in\nexercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the\nchastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of\nthe measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an\ninclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they\npositively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and\nQueen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn\nLeague--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the\nPresbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made\nrepeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had\nthey been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the\nsame consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to\nhold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased\nagainst Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections\nof the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,\ntheir numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant\nof serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,\nwhose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no\nbad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the\nRevolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and\nvehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to\ndiscourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed\none violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite\ninterest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet\nrepeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of\ntheir discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart\nfamily.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by\nthe great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a\nmoderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the\nformer oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having\nexercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued\nby Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately\nsubsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and\nhaving the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding\ndescent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle\nand the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods\nto sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell\nBridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,\nonce the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as\nthe surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in\nromantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence\nof the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften\nitself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by\ndetached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of\nflourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the\nabode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which\nwas covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up\nto this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation\nof a porter\'s lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in\nScotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes\nwere mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock\nhard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him\nbefore the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated\nthat the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended\nfrom the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green\ntrees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about\nfive years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain\nof the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old\noak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring\nto know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,\nhardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart\non her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering "What\'s\nyour wull?"which is usually a peasant\'s first answer, if it can be\ncalled one, to all questions whatever."I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.""Mammie, mammie," exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door\nof the hut, "come out and speak to the gentleman."Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,\noriginally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that\ndecent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant\'s wife of\nScotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed\ndown her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder\ngirl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as\nsoon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to\nlook at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful\nbreeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything\nresembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then\nreplied, "I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called\nCuthbert Headrigg."It\'s my gudeman, sir," said the young woman, with a smile of welcome."Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,\nCuddie,"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the\nhut--"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye\'ll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he\'s\ndown at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu\' o\' bread and cheese, or a drink o\' ale, till\nour gudeman comes.It\'s gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews\nit; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their\nhearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o\' maut to the\nbrowst."As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader\'s old\nacquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still\npresented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,\nwhich indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked\non the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his\ndaughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,\n"What\'s your wull wi\' me, sir?""I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country," said the\ntraveller, "and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can\nanswer them.""Nae doubt, sir," said Cuddie, after a moment\'s hesitation."But I would\nfirst like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony\nquestions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend\na\', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a\' thing about them.My mother gar \'d\nme learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to\nlearn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and\nwhiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o\' them; and when I cam\nto man\'s yestate, cam another kind o\' questioning in fashion that I liked\nwaur than Effectual Calling; and the \'did promise and vow\' of the tape\nwere yokit to the end o\' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear\nquestions asked befor I answer them.""You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only\nrelate to the state of the country."replied Cuddie; "ou, the country\'s weel eneugh, an it werena\nthat dour deevil, Claver\'se (they ca\' him Dundee now), that\'s stirring\nabout yet in the Highlands, they say, wi\' a\' the Donalds and Duncans and\nDugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi\' him, to set\nthings asteer again, now we hae gotten them a\' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there\'s little doubt o\' that; he\'ll gie him\nhis fairing, I\'ll be caution for it.""What makes you so positive of that, my friend?""I heard it wi\' my ain lugs," answered Cuddie, "foretauld to him by a man\nthat had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again\njust to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca\' Drumshinnel.""I can hardly believe you, my friend.""Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life," said Cuddie; "it was\nher explained it a\' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very\nnames, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver\'se and his dragoons.They ca\'d the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he\nwas a braw preacher for a\' that.""You seem," said the stranger, "to live in a rich and peaceful country.""It\'s no to compleen o\', sir, an we get the crap weel in," quoth Cuddie;\n"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin\' as fast on the tap o\' that brigg\nyonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie\na spectacle."I was waiting upon Monmouth that\nmorning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action," said the\nstranger."Then ye saw a bonny stour," said Cuddie, "that sail serve me for\nfighting a\' the days o\' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your\nred scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.""And which side were you upon, my friend?"continued the inquisitive\nstranger.retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for\nsuch,--"there\'s nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking\nme.""I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that\noccasion as servant to Henry Morton."said Cuddie, in surprise, "how came ye by that secret?No that I\nneed care a bodee about it, for the sun\'s on our side o\' the hedge now.I\nwish my master were living to get a blink o\'t.""He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and\na\' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse\nwas ever heard o\' mair.""You had some regard for him, then?"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a\'\nbody that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye\nhad but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing\ndragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till \'t!There was he\nand that sour Whigamore they ca\'d Burley: if twa men could hae won a\nfield, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.""You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad\nhold no communion wi\' him, because o\' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi\' mony o\' the\nPresbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could\nget nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he\nhasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae\ndriven him clean wud.""And--and," said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--"do you\nknow anything of Lord Evan dale?""<DW37> I ken onything o\' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up\nby yonder at the house, that\'s as gude as married to him?""No, only what they ca\' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It\'s\nno mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason\nby Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye\nsitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower\nGlasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain."In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few\nlarge drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard."The deil\'s in this man," said Cuddie to himself; "I wish he would either\nlight aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the\nshower begin."But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after\nhis last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,\nrecovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked\nCuddie "if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.""She does," replied Cuddie, "but in a very sma\' way.They hae been a sad\nchanged family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh\nfirst and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a\' the bonny barony and\nthe holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,\nthat I suld hae gotten back again, and a\' for naething, as \'a body may\nsay, but just the want o\' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the\nconfusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.""I have heard something of this," said the stranger, deepening his voice\nand averting his head."I have some interest in the family, and would\nwillingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house\nto-night, my friend?""It\'s but a corner of a place, sir," said Cuddie, "but we\'se try, rather\nthan ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi\' ye,\nsir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.""I am liable to a dizziness," said the stranger, "but it will soon wear\noff.""I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir," said Cuddie; "and we\'ll see\nabout a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what\nwe have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has\nsae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord\nEvandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o\' some sort, to the onstead.""I shall be easily accommodated," said the stranger, as he entered the\nhouse."And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted," said Cuddie; "I ken\nweel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane."Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to\nattend in the mean while to the stranger\'s accommodation.The officer\nentered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,\nand carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the\ncloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he\nexcused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time\ntill Cuddie\'s return, he entered into some chat with the children,\ncarefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his\nlandlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,\n                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, "that\nthe horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a\nbed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the\nlike o\' them could gie him."said the stranger, with an interrupted and\nbroken voice."No, stir, they\'re awa wi\' a\' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,\nand my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she\'s no a\nfee\'d servant.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a\' trust\nand management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom\nwithout their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we\nserve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a\' the haill warld,\nan her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy\nMargaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she\'s no ill to the\npoor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit\nwi\' the sowens?""Never mind, lad," rejoined Jenny, "ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken\nweel that ye like your brose het."Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at\nthis repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence\nbetwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length\nhe suddenly interrupted them by the question: "Can you tell me when Lord\nEvandale\'s marriage takes place?""Very soon, we expect," answered Jenny, before it was possible for her\nhusband to reply; "it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o\'\nauld Major Bellenden."said the stranger; "I heard at Edinburgh he was\nno more."He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother\'s wife and his\nniece were turned out o\' their ain house; and he had himsell sair\nborrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o\' King\nJames\'s days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>\nto please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the\nlaw gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o\'\nyears about it; and, as I said before, the major ne\'er held up his head\nagain.And then cam the pitting awa o\' the Stewart line; and, though he\nhad but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean\nbroke the heart o\' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a\'\nthat was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow\'d na\nsee onybody want.""He was indeed," said the stranger, with a faltering voice, "an admirable\nman,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left\nwithout fortune, as well as without a protector?""They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale\nlives," said Jenny; "he has been a true friend in their griefs.E\'en to\nthe house they live in is his lordship\'s; and never man, as my auld\ngudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae\nlang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.""And why," said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,\n"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?""There was the lawsuit to be ended," said Jenny readily, "forby many\nother family arrangements.""Na, but," said Cuddie, "there was another reason forby; for the young\nleddy--"\n\n"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens," said his wife; "I see\nthe gentleman\'s far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad\nkill him a chicken in an instant.""There is no occasion," said the stranger; "I shall want only a glass of\nwater, and to be left alone.""You\'ll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me," said Jenny, lighting\na small lantern, "and I\'ll show you the way."Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, "That\nthe bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into\nthe fire," so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading\nsome thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door\nof a small garden.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an\nold-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal\nparterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,\nand lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked\npardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his\napartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but\nwhen she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk\nforward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to\nbe a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his\nshort-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently\ndrew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without\nseeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was\nprepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense\nof her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an\nindication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of\nwhich she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she\ninformed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,\non one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and\non the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin\nwainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good\nrest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, "I doubt\nwe\'re ruined folk!"returned the imperturbed\nCuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at\nanything."Wha d\' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to\nlight here!""Why, wha the muckle deil d\'ye say he is?There\'s nae law against\nharbouring and intercommunicating now," said Cuddie; "sae, Whig or Tory,\nwhat need we care wha he be?""Ay, but it\'s ane will ding Lord Evandale\'s marriage ajee yet, if it\'s\nno the better looked to," said Jenny; "it\'s Miss Edith\'s first joe, your\nain auld maister, Cuddie."exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, "Crow ye that I am\nblind?"Ay, but, Cuddie lad," replied Jenny, "though ye are no blind, ye are no\nsae notice-taking as I am.""Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see\nabout the man that was like our Maister Harry?""I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,\nand speaking wi\' a madelike voice, sae I e\'en tried him wi\' some tales\no lang syne; and when I spake o\' the brose, ye ken, he didna just\nlaugh,--he\'s ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi\' his\nee that I kend he took up what I said.And a\' his distress is about Miss\nEdith\'s marriage; and I ne\'er saw a man mair taen down wi\' true love in\nmy days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was\nwhen she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were\ncoming against Tillietudlem wi\' the rebels.--But what\'s the matter wi\'\nthe man now?""What\'s the matter wi\' me indeed!"said Cuddie, who was again hastily\nputting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; "am I no gaun\nup this instant to see my maister?""Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate," said Jenny, coolly and\nresolutely."D \'ye think I am to be John\nTamson\'s man, and maistered by women a\' the days o\' my life?""And whase man wad ye be?And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,\nCuddie, lad?""I\'ll gar ye comprehend in the making of a\nhay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;\nand frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he\'s\npurposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be\nmarried, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But\nif Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before\nthe very minister wi\' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I\'se\nwarrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.""Weel," replied Cuddie, "and what\'s my business wi\' that?If Miss Edith\nlikes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free\nto change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps\nhe had a promise frae yoursell.""Halliday\'s a liar, and ye\'re naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,\nCuddie.And then for this leddy\'s choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a\'\nthe gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o\' his coat; and how can he\nkeep Leddy Margaret and the young leddy?""Nae doubt the auld laird left his\nhousekeeper the liferent, as he heard nought o\' his nephew; but it\'s but\nspeaking the auld wife fair, and they may a\' live brawly thegither, Leddy\nMargaret and a\'.""Rout tout, lad," replied Jenny; "ye ken them little to think leddies o\'\ntheir rank wad set up house wi\' auld Ailie Wilson, when they\'re maist\nower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun\nfollow the camp, if she tak Morton.""That wad sort ill wi\' the auld leddy, to be sure," said Cuddie; "she wad\nhardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.""Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a\' about Whig and\nTory," continued Jenny."To be sure," said Cuddie, "the auld leddy\'s unto kittle in thae\npoints.""And then, Cuddie," continued his helpmate, who had reserved her\nstrongest argument to the last, "if this marriage wi\' Lord Evandale is\nbroken off, what comes o\' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and\nthe cow\'s grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be\nturned on the wide warld!"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that\nway, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, "Weel,\nwoman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a\' this din about it?""Just do naething at a\'," said Jenny."Never seem to ken onything about\nthis gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,\nor up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and\nsleepit in the byre or he had gane up by; but it canna be helpit now.The\nneist thing\'s to get him cannily awa the morn, and I judge he\'ll be in\nnae hurry to come back again."said Cuddie; "and maun I no speak to him, then?""For your life, no," said Jenny."Ye\'re no obliged to ken him; and I\nwadna hae tauld ye, only I feared ye wad ken him in the morning.""Aweel," said Cuddie, sighing heavily, "I\'se awa to pleugh the outfield\nthen; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o\' the gate.""Very right, my dear hinny," replied Jenny."Naebody has better sense than\nyou when ye crack a bit wi\' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne\'er do\nonything aff hand out o\' your ain head.""Ane wad think it\'s true," quoth Cuddie; "for I hae aye had some carline\nor quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o\' my ain.There\nwas first my mither," he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself\ninto bed; "then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca\' my soul my ain;\nthen my mither and her quarrelled, and pu\'ed me twa ways at anes, as if\nilk ane had an end o\' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the\nBaker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife," he murmured in\ncontinuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, "and she\'s\nlike to tak the guiding o\' me a\' thegither.""And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a\' your life?"said Jenny, as\nshe closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and\nextinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader\nthat, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by\ntheir servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny\'s\nutter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady\nEmily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale."Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?"said Jenny,\nconfounded with this unexpected apparition."We want nothing but the pass-key," said Miss Bellenden; "Gudyill will\nopen the windows of the little parlour.""The little parlour\'s locked, and the lock\'s, spoiled," answered Jenny,\nwho recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the\nbedchamber of her guest."In the red parlour, then," said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front\nof the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton\nhad been conducted."All will be out," thought Jenny, "unless I can get him smuggled out of\nthe house the back way."So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty."I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there," was her next\nnatural reflection."But then they wad hae been for asking him to\nbreakfast.what will I do?--And there\'s Gudyill walking in\nthe garden too!"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; "and\nI daurna gang in the back way till he\'s aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the\npurpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill\'s temper was\nnot improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many\npeevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what\nwas most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the\npresent occasion, all Jenny\'s efforts to remove him from the garden\nserved only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the\nshrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy\nKnowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily\'s\nservant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken\nunder his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,\nprosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who\nstood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and\nimpatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate\nmorning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the\ndoor of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was\ndesirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in\nwhich Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss\nBellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of\nreflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the\nservant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her\nfriend."He is not yet come," she said.Why\nexpress so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come\nto Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even\nengaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,\nI do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.""Evandale was never capricious," answered his sister; "I am sure he will\nsatisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold\nhim.""What I chiefly fear," said Edith, "is his having engaged in some of the\nplots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that\ndreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined\nthem ere now but for my uncle\'s death, which gave him so much additional\ntrouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply\nsensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all\nfor their restoration!"answered Lady Emily,--"it is a point of honour with\nEvandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the\nGuards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for\nyears; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who\nset down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be\naware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early\npredilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I\ntrust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe\nyou are the only one who can keep him so.""You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with\nthe host,--\'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.\'""I have promised," said Edith, in a faint voice; "but I trust I shall not\nbe urged on the score of time.""Nay," said Lady Emily, "I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to\nplead his own cause.""Stay, stay, for God\'s sake!"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her."Not I, not I," said the young lady, making her escape; "the third person\nmakes a silly figure on such occasions.When you want me for breakfast, I\nwill be found in the willow-walk by the river."As she tripped out of the room, Lord Evandale entered."Good-morrow,\nBrother, and good-by till breakfast-time," said the lively young lady;\n"I trust you will give Miss Bellenden some good reasons for disturbing\nher rest so early in the morning."And so saying, she left them together, without waiting a reply."And now, my lord," said Edith, "may I desire to know the meaning of your\nsingular request to meet you here at so early an hour?"She was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having\ncomplied with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she\nwas struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his\ncountenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, "For God\'s sake, what is\nthe matter?""His Majesty\'s faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive\nvictory near Blair of Athole; but, alas!my gallant friend Lord Dundee--"\n\n"Has fallen?"said Edith, anticipating the rest of his tidings."True, most true: he has fallen in the arms of victory, and not a man\nremains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in King\nJames\'s service.This, Edith, is no time for temporizing with our duty.I\nhave given directions to raise my followers, and I must take leave of you\nthis evening.""Do not think of it, my lord," answered Edith; "your life is--essential\nto your friends,--do not throw it away in an adventure so rash.What can\nyour single arm, and the few tenants or servants who might follow you, do\nagainst the force of almost all Scotland, the Highland clans only\nexcepted?""Listen to me, Edith," said Lord Evandale."I am not so rash as you may\nsuppose me, nor are my present motives of such light importance as to\naffect only those personally dependent on myself.The Life Guards, with\nwhom I served so long, although new-modelled and new-officered by the\nPrince of Orange, retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful\nmaster; and "--and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of\nthe apartment had ears--"when my foot is known to be in the stirrup, two\nregiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurper\'s service, and\nfight under my orders.They delayed only till Dundee should descend into\nthe Lowlands; but since he is no more, which of his successors dare take\nthat decisive step, unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves!Meantime, the zeal of the soldiers will die away.I must bring them to a\ndecision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader\nhas obtained, and burning to avenge his untimely death.""And will you, on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to\nbe," said Edith, "take a part of such dreadful moment?""I will," said Lord Evandale,--"I must; my honour and loyalty are both\npledged for it.""And all for the sake," continued Miss Bellenden, "of a prince whose\nmeasures, while he was on the throne, no one could condemn more than Lord\nEvandale?""Most true," replied Lord Evandale; "and as I resented, even during the\nplenitude of his power, his innovations on Church and State, like a\nfreeborn subject, I am determined I will assert his real rights, when he\nis in adversity, like a loyal one.Let courtiers and sycophants flatter\npower and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term\nrashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on\nbattle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging\ncoldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your\nown, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar\ncircumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet\nanother request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these\ncredentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her\ngrandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I\n     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me\n     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would\n     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at\n     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie\'s only child.But it is the\n     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the\n     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not\n     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild\n     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must\n     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young\n     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour\n     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy\n     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you\n     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for\n     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I\n     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,\n     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the\n     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner\n     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,\n     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven\'s own free will,\n     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us\n     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet\n     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the\n     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to\n     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal\n     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers\n     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred\n     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house\n     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader\'s patience by quoting more of Lady\nMargaret\'s prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her\ncommands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her\nmarriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from\nher hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a\nterm to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for\never?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his\nperseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the\nobligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one\nday comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be\npressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails\nhimself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with\nprecipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness\nthan generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the\napartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I\nshould have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned\nto Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one\nwhich she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to\nweigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must\ngive my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,\nby the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some\nDutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride\nmust remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and\nprovisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting\nher aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the\ntitles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was\ncompelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale\'s suit was urged with\ndelicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts\nto former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree\nof ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief\nsummons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord\nEvandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as\nmine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an\nunexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss\nBellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord\nEvandale\'s assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own\nrespiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my\nfeelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to\na measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which\nhe could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the\ncontract, her grandmother\'s wish and command, the propriety of insuring\nher comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long\nattachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at\nlength, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless\nreluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much\ngenerosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having\nthe ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with\njoyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in\nattendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned\nofficer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the\nsecret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of\nwitnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen\nit on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord\nEvandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a\ncircumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him\nthe attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,\nunless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily\nurged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without\nwaiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he\nwent in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of\nwhich she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those\ndamsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in\nmatrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could\nnot be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the\nbridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all\nthe usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and\ncondolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily\nbeheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of\nconsolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission\ndown cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she\npressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,\nand lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her\ncaresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and\npettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all\nthis, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my\nbrother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from\none period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or\nhighly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale\nthat he will seek no woman\'s hand against her inclination; and, though\nhis sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady\nfurther than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss\nBellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother\'s future\nhappiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these\nexpressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for\nan attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring\nto resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering\nvoice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord\nEvandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has\nhonoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to\na sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady\nEmily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from\nhim, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith\nBellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,\nand I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and\npainful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with\nEvandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future\noccur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no\nidle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous\nand affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the\nmemory of other days--"\n\nAs she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before\nbeen hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which\nwas partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned\nher eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which\nseemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of\nEdith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered\nshriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the\nchaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were\nnecessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even\nthen her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]\n\n\n"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven\nand earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this\nill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted\nfriendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,\nbut never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when\nI thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven\nher mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you\'re sufficient to drive\nall the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed\nto jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your\ncause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a\nman looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for\nyou or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic\nscene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could\nhave--"\n\n"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting\nfurther inquiry; "for Heaven\'s sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady\nbegins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a\nfeeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny\nwith her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain\nwith that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment\nthan Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her\nnext motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,\nto her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most\nuntruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my\nhighest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my\nword and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you\nhave not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost\ndegree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion\nof an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been\nlong in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,\nor, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a\nsleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one\nwhat I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were\nher last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a\nchild.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,\n"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me\nas a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and\npallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by\nwhatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really\ndisturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted\nall his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the\nsecret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and\nlook into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him\nfor ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;\nhis dress was a horseman\'s cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his\nexpression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was\nexamined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,\nif she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he\ncame to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and\ndead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended\nbetween you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry\nwhose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with\nsurprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally\noverthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my\nill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her\nhealth is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord\nEvandale\'s principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards\non the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and\nghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any\ndiscovery of the--"\n\nHe had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the\ndangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I\nhave seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out\nof his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me\nso?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied\nHalliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some\nstrange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I\nendeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale\'s inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given\n(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to\nleave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed\nprincipally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and\naffectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her\nspirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of\nconfusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the\napartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of\nfootsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton\'s face\nhad been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look\nat her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for\never.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and\nshe learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the\nstranger\'s horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed\ninto the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his\nhorse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The\nsecret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it\nshould remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him\nin the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie\nand me a\' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,\nthe supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on\nwhich anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and\nobliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him\nhaunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said\nHalliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but\nher evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when\nthe apparition had taken place.Lady Emily\'s servant was waiting orders\nin the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a\nmile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree\nat beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the\nprotection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance\nof his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,\nthus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of\nEdith\'s character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious\nchange of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the\napparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated\nby the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not\nbeen for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for\nthinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss\nBellenden\'s vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it\nseemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so\nvainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be\nlost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,\nshould be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer\nany reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present\nGovernment favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly\nbrought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to\nobtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in\nwhich, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L\'Ancre on the subject of\napparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the\nnature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and\ndetermined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition\nof the deceased Henry Morton\'s spirit, the possibility of which he was,\nas a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to\ndeny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,\nhad appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some\nstrong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived\nthe eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the\nmost probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed\nhimself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had\noccasioned that morning\'s disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss\nBellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to\nbe in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have\nbeen the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it\nby my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the\npresence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in\ndespite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when\nshe heard of her granddaughter\'s illness), rendered a step equally\nnatural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury\nto her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure\non his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement\nwith me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems\nalmost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,\n               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most\ndistinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the\ncommon mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the\nfirmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and\nwhen, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even\naggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his\ngrief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in\ngeneral to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a\nparoxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his\nlong-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for\nso many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had\nlaid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to\nrefuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an\nunexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid\nher farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested\nher not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she\nmight transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it\nwas addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only\nconclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own\nself-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations\nsince his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only\nlook upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and\neven if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still\nhave been inconsistent with Morton\'s generosity of disposition to disturb\ntheir arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by\nabsence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a\nthousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage\nwhich their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret\nBellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity\nof acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might\nhave felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that\nthe ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and\nlearning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he\ncould not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real\nprogress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen\nden--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have\nrelated, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he\nwas still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to\nrelinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the\ndialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he\ninvoluntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not\nattempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon\ntheir interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often\nthe recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude\nwhich he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he\njustly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him\nfrom a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,\nbut gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed\nforcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his\nevery nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy\npillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by\nmy selfish sorrows, one atom\'s weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I\nwas dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt\nthou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and\nseeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his\ncontinuing within hearing of Edith\'s voice, he hastily rushed from his\napartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the\ngarden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the\nspot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his\near, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the\nparlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes\nunalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton\'s presence was detected by\nher raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to\nthe unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so\nill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He\npassed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible\nthat he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of\ninstinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference\nto the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was\nactually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a\ndecisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to\nbe kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some\ncommotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post\nsentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller\npass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades\nstationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had\ngone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and\nHalliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the\njudgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the\nbelief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up\nthe phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in\nsome unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his\nvigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the\nbrink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were\nconducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the\ngallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the\nriver, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his\nfeet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above\nhis swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose\nmovements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking\nmeasures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A\nperfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water\nwas as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal\'s\ncourse somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which\nseemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second\nattempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the\nground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of\nself-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,\nto recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when\naltogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in\nwhich he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third\nattempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded\nbetter than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon\nthe farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to\ndirect my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the\ncompass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the\nwish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and\ndrowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had\noccasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere\nhe was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He\nremembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the\nbitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost\nincessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public\ncareer.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that\nexistence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous\nmanner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to\nbear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What\nhave I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I\nknew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in\nsoliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of\nher inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with\nwhich, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become\nacquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his\nown disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith\nand her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly\nrushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it\ncan be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained\nfrom him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he\nis, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once\nprevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what\ninfluence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes\nof those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn\nthat I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their\nhappiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought\nthe nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the\nvalley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no\nother difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he\nfound himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the\npopinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed\nand dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of\nanguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail\nto restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He\nturned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering\nBurley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge\nwhich he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested\nhimself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the\ncircumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,\ntrusting that, from Cuddie\'s account of a schism betwixt Burley and his\nbrethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less\nrancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the\npower which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more\nfavourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the\nneighbourhood of his deceased uncle\'s habitation of Milnwood.It rose\namong glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early\nrecollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful\nimpression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the\nsensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood\nand early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests\nof public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple\nwhom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my\njourney, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they\nsaid my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I\nhave enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a\ndisappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor\nin my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,\nancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once\nmore."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about\nit; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old\nhousekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates\ndeficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow\nwindows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had\nnot been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which\nadmitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since\nthe spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the\nstaples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much\nknocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was\nusual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of\nAlison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with\nwhich it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,\nenveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey\ntresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while\nher shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"\nsaid Henry."She\'s no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,\nthe state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode\nof denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear\'d person to speer for her\nin sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress\nWilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie\nthe same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former\noccasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have\nbeen so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae\nheard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca\' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the\nback o\' the house, and ye\'ll find a laigh door; it\'s on the latch, for\nit\'s never barred till sunset.Ye \'ll open \'t,--and tak care ye dinna fa\'\nower the tub, for the entry\'s dark,--and then ye\'ll turn to the right,\nand then ye\'ll hand straught forward, and then ye\'ll turn to the right\nagain, and ye \'ll tak heed o\' the cellarstairs, and then ye \'ll be at the\ndoor o\' the little kitchen,--it\'s a\' the kitchen that\'s at Milnwood\nnow,--and I\'ll come down t\'ye, and whate\'er ye wad say to Mistress\nWilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness\nof the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through\nthe dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little\nkitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these\nstraits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one\nside in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the\nother in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment\narose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,\nonce his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his\nmaster return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by\nhis former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I\nhave known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of\nAlison\'s high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served\nat once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the\nstairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly\nreached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for\nhousekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The\nfire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with\nthe closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which\nwas preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a\ngirl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that\nAilie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the\nfeatures, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and\nindulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;\nthe coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;\nbut laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other\ntrifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late\nproprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi\' Mrs.Wilson,"\nwas her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for\nthe business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the\nfull merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in\nunchastened splendour.Morton\'s sensations, confounded between the past\nand present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had\ndifficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But\nas he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing\nthat which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for\nremaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,\nrepeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi\' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o\', the brother o\' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were\nborn.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of\nthe son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his\npassage to Holland.""That\'s ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony\na tear it\'s cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough\'d awa\nwi\' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the\nbread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to\nbe handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,\nfrugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, \'Ailie,\' (he aye\nca\'d me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), \'Ailie, take ye care and haud\nthe gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood\'s gane out\nlike the last sough of an auld sang.\'And sae he fell out o\' ae dwam into\nanother, and ne\'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou\'dna\nmak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi\'.He\ncou\'d ne\'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on\nthe table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,\nMorton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the\ndog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former\nrecollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course\nof capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant\nto betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could\nnot forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog\'s name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden\nsurprise,--"ye ken our dog\'s name, and it\'s no a common ane.And the\ncreature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller\ntone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton\'s neck, cling\nto him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for\njoy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart\nto attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most\ngrateful warmth, and answered,--\n\n"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past\nand present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome\nme to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye\'ll hae mony friends,--ye \'ll hae mony\nfriends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a\ngude guide o\'t!she continued, pushing him back from her\nwith her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if\nto read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather\nthan time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye\'re sair altered, hinny;\nyour face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny\nred-and-white cheeks are turned a\' dark and sun-burnt.mony\'s the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na\nwrite to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did\nye come creepin\' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie\npoor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give\nthe kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our\nreaders in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,\n               But that is gone for being Richard\'s friend;\n               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to\nMrs.Wilson\'s own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as\nhousekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,\n"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found\ndangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than\nthe late Milnwood\'s apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"\nand as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,\nwashed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,\nunless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,\nthey were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,\nwhich the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,\nalthough neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the\ncomfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,\ninformed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all\nhands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the\nskiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the\ndeck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their\ninclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer\nwho had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going\nimmediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the\nStadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his\nfather-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the\ncharacter of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to\ndistinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without\nforcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and\nretirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of\nthe British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your\nprudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time\nhad elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United\nStates, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the\nincognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,\nto be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which\nthe prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his\nprudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of\nhis native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that\ncannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for\nyou, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for\nthe recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss\nregiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will\nmeet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and\nlet the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on\nvarious occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the\nmoment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His\ncommands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I\nwonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the\nvessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with\nwhich I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance\nwhich must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the\nPrince of Oranger\'s court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o\'\nMilnwood was kend a\' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a\nperiod when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,\nAilie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother\'s name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds\nfar bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun\ntak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,\nfor I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from\nevery one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good\nhands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I\'m hopefu\' ye are no meaning\nmine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I\'m ower\nfailed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very\npressing, and spak very civilly; but I\'m ower auld a cat to draw that\nstrae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he\'s dune mony a ane.And then\nI thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup\nmilk, and keep a\' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir\nuncle\'s time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive\nand guide the gear canny.Ye\'ll hae learned that in Holland, I\'se\nwarrant, for they\'re thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye\'ll be\nfor keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that\'s gave; and,\nindeed, I would approve o\' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as\nthree times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o\' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the\ngenerosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie\'s thoughts and\nactions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast\nbetween her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You\nmust know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days\non some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,\nAilie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint\nyou fully with my motives and intentions.""E\'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my\nneighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me\nwhere he keepit his gear, and that\'s what maist folk like to hae as\nprivate as possibly may be.--But come awa wi\' me, hinny, till I show ye\nthe oak-parlour how grandly it\'s keepit, just as if ye had been expected\nhaine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind\no\' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said\nto mysell, What needs I fash wi\' grates and carpets and cushions and the\nmuckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they\'ll ne\'er come hame that\naught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the\nscrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high\nstate of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as\nhe followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his\nshune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of\nauthority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the\nfeelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at\nhis occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed\nhad not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily\nsupposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and\nlong upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that\nthe large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green\nworsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the\nroom looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were\ntwo objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,\ndissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety\nof sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in\ncomplete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and\ndetermined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and\nbrocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely\nindebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae\nexpensive fal-lalls that he ne\'er wore in his life, instead o\' his douce\nRaploch grey, and his band wi\' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything\napproaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly\nperson of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done\non his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from\nAilie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own\nhands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no\notherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any\nevent of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have\ncackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the\nextravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of\nold times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which\nshe assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,\nand planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as\ngovernante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and\ncastle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some\nfitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and\nspend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered\nlikely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged\nit--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,\nand which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she\nhad laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them\nfrom time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which\nfew persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his\nnew attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae\ndecently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than\nwhen he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she\ncalled "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of\na velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been\nconverted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and\nappeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of\nits transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the\nnecessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye\nsleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was\nthe reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected\nyou would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e\'er mortal een\nthe like o\' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out\nof a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper\'s Howff; he\ncan give me a bed, I suppose?"I\'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for \'t\ninto the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign\nparts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith\nfor naething, and thanks t\' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her\nremonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I\nmay be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o\'\ntwal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye\nventuresome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took\na surer gate, and never parted wi\' it when he had anes gotten \'t."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and\nmounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn\npromise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard\nfrom him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted\nslowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,\nas she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature\'s\nheart before a week were out."Where\'s the jolly host\n               You told me of?\'T has been my custom ever\n               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable\nadventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more\nthan once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which\nhe had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other\nrespects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But\na few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that\nhe had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the\ntraces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the\nraw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only\nchance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,\nmight remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if\nthere was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old\ncelebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less\ncivil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as\nin corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord\'s complaisance for his guests\ndecreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had\nacquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances\nof love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected\nby a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were\nparticularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the\ncharacter his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse\naccommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the\npublic room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have\nbeen thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the\nvery apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory\nat the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many\nserious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that\nfestivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff\nseemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly\npresented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o\' brandy;"\ntwo or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the\ninactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,\nindeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank\na little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian\nminister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in\npersons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he\nlooked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance\nrenders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,\nhuman beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with\nthe same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the\nreadiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the\nsmiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the\ntap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down\nand take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly\nacceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from\nevery guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,\nand was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,\nalong with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he\nreceived encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor\nbefore them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,\nupon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the\nchange of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care\nto mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton\nthat he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers\namang us, mair or less.There\'s a wheen German horse down at Glasgow\nyonder; they ca\' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he\'s\nas grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e\'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and\nshort black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the\nman.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,\nconsidering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,\nand as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar\'d me stop\nin the middle of Torphichen\'s Rant,--the best piece o\' music that ever\nbag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers\n"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld\ncaterpillars; these were Claver\'se\'s lads a while syne, and wad be again,\nmaybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic\na fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it\'s lang or the deil die.I\nwad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he\'ll\nbe doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are\nthey then?A\' thae hell-rakers o\' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a\nmoment.Nae doubt they\'re Willie\'s men e\'en now, as they were James\'s a\nwhile syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae\nthey to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There\'s ae\ngude thing o\' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca\' it,--folks may\nspeak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o\' being hauled awa to the\nguard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as\nI wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress\nhe had made in mine host\'s familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation\nproper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something\nof importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called\nElizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord\'s\nlaugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife\'s (haly be her rest!)--my ain\nwife\'s first gudeman\'s sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but\nsair she\'s been trysted wi\' misfortunes,--the loss o\' twa decent lads o\'\nsons, in the time o\' the persecution, as they ca\' it nowadays; and\ndoucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and\ncondemning nane.If there\'s an honest woman in the world, it\'s Bessie\nMaclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons\nclinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,\nthey aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"\n\n"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own\nsuperior accommodations,--"a sour browst o\' sma\' ale that she sells to\nfolk that are over drouthy wi\' travel to be nice; but naething to ca\' a\nstirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a\' the night?Ye\'ll hardly get accommodation\nat Bessie\'s," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife\'s relative by\nno means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and\nI only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of\nhis calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not\nserve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure\'s house, and\nI desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye\'ll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,\nsomewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye\'ll need if ye gae doun the\nwater for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and\nthen tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the\nhills,--ye\'ll ken \'t by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o\' a\nburn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna\nmiss Widow Maclure\'s public, for deil another house or hauld is on the\nroad for ten lang Scots miles, and that\'s worth twenty English.I am\nsorry your honour would think o\' gaun out o\' my house the night.But my\nwife\'s gude-sister is a decent woman, and it\'s no lost that a friend\ngets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the\nsummer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the\nmoors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,\nwhen Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,\nhe was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by\nsoldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman\nwho apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should\nhave become inseparably interwoven with that man\'s, without anything more\non my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to\nHeaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of\nmind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his\nhorse\'s head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had\nonce been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a\nfew, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,\nor clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and\nof cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to\ntake refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted\nand decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to\nindicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down\namong them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and\nanimation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and\nmost savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when\ngazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains\nof fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road\nfollowed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to\nbe distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts\nof the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,\n"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a\nsea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when\nhis fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and\nover.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a\nshoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the\nobjects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession\nof ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the\nbanks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a\ncroft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,\nwhose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green\nwith moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered\ndamage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance\nof verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt\nand worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might\nhere find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,\nrude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in\napproaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate\ndignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that\nBurley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated\nby the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge\nalder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress\nMaclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow\'s cake and the widow\'s\ncruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can\ncome amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better\ntrade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you\ndo not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like\nthat of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi\'\nsodgering in this puir land that I am e\'en content that I can see nae\nmair o\'t wi\' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,\ncompassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your\nprofession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily\neneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look\nafter your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma\'\nmatter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl\nof twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman\'s\nhorse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and\nshake down a lock o\' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come\nthis way, sir," she continued; "ye\'ll find my house clean, though it\'s a\npuir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,\n               And fast her tears did fa\n               "Ye wadna be warn\'d, my son Johnie,\n               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had\nspoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and\nwas neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which\nthe hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments\nwere placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had\nsmall occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of\nmaintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her\nblindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of\ninstinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on\nyour guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of\nZarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh\nto hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a\' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,\nturning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that\nis, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this\nlast change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied\nthe landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would\nhave brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of\nworship to tender consciences, it\'s little matter what it has brought to\na puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It\'s a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae\nnight, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman\nstopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune\nout wi\' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the\nother, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o\' our enemies.You that\'s a sodger will think me but a silly auld\nwife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the\npursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some\no\' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to\nSisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to\nsave it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I\nwanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that\nmurdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye\'ll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell\nwi\' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the\ntother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his\nmother\'s face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,\nto my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;\nand sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might\nhelp on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale\'s young blood\nto his enemies\' sword wad ne\'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive\nagain.""Was it Lord Evandale whose\nlife you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae\nme a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when\nhe was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and\nthe estate was sair plea\'d between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the\npresent laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for\nlove o\' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o\' the best and\nbonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat\nthe Castle and land, and on the back o\' that came the Revolution, and wha\nto turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig\na\' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion\'s sake.And then he got\nfavour, and Lord Evandale\'s head was under water; for he was ower proud\nand manfu\' to bend to every blast o\' wind, though mony a ane may ken as\nweel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill\nfriend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil\nOlifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set\nby and ill looked on, and his word ne\'er asked; and then Basil, wha\'s a\nrevengefu\' man, set himsell to vex him in a\' shapes, and especially by\noppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that\nsaved Lord Evandale\'s life, and that he was sae kind to.But he\'s mistaen\nif that\'s his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae\nme about the selling my kye for rent or e\'er it was due, or the putting\nthe dragoons on me when the country\'s quiet, or onything else that will\nvex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld\'s loss is the\nleast part o\'t."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and\nhigh-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration\nupon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of\nvengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say\nthat a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to\nreturn on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him\nlook to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that\nare lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o\' them has\nbeen twice up at Tillietudlem.He\'s a kind of favourite wi\' the laird,\nthough he was in former times ane o\' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade\nthrough a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca\' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale\'s safety," said Morton,\n"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these\nsuspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you\nindulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell\nof Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and\nalarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so\nalarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked\nafter by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is\nto come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry\nhas nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the\nsame with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her\nfingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I\'ll be free\nwi\' you.But, for God\'s sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,\nI trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party\nat Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I\ncan trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu\' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle\nalmaist frae this Government as e\'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But\nI am only just now returned from abroad.""I\'ll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of\nlistening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting\nintelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead\nof casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and\nturned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there\nwas not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then\ncontinued,--"I\'ll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again\nthe Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish\ndevices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from\nthe countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship\nof the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange\nwad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was\nhard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it\nmay be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld\nplace o\' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair\nespecially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne\'er\nforget how he was bending hither of a\' nights in the year on that e\'ening\nafter the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off\nfor that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the\nhigh-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her\nnarrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming\nit with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o\' me than that I hae\nbeen willing to save the life o\' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only\nwished to show you that I know so much of this person\'s affairs that I\nmight be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your\nnarrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though\nits tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been\ndethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word\nof the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged\nclergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant\nKirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu\'\nchampions o\' the testimony agree e\'en waur wi\' this than wi\' the open\ntyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and\ndeadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi\' fizenless\nbran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving\ncreature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that\nmight warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o\' morality driven\nabout his lugs, and--"\n\n"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old\nwoman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the\nduties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you\nare not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of\nthe same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and\nfasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we\nare like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and\nfought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might\nbe made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new\nbottom, as, after a\', when King James went awa, I understand the great\nquarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed\nprelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi\' the\npresent model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet\nour honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and\nfreedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o\' the\nJacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa\' to the ground\nlike a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa\nstools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom\nof conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the\neast, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we\nblinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver\'se himsell, that they ca\' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting\nwould have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,\n"there\'s sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that\nwere King James\'s greatest faes are on his side now.Claver\'se spake our\nfriend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there\nwas a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi\' him;\nand now he\'s anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord\nEvandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,\nthae starts o\' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair\nadvantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi\' John Balfour o\' Burley, and\ndinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against\nthe Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,\nand the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi\'\nhim, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,\nye ken little o\' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae\nman can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might\nhae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my\npuir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to\nrecollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at\nMilnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and\nsome whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of\nBurley\'s soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which\nseveral circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a\nvictim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,\nnot only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might\nhave discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to\nbe proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which\nit occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or\nsurrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these\nvisitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from\nthe narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,\nand the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate\nfidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It\nwas, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men\nlike Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to\nthe wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the\nworld, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and\ncourage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined\nvalour.Maclure\'s information confirmed\nMorton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the\ngate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of\ndanger, as he ca\'s it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of\nrefuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,\nfor whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do\nwithout to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person\nfound refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature\ntook refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It\'s a doleful\nplace, but he loves it abune a\' others, because he has sae often been in\nsafe hiding there; and it\'s my belief he prefers it to a tapestried\nchamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day\nsyne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to\ncome o\'t.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your\nrest, for ye maun stir wi\' the first dawn o\' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the\nevening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,\nbetween sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the\nriders\' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such\npainful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found\n               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,\n               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard\nat the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish\ntreble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn\nor the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth\nand joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,\nthrough the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,\nunmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the\nwhole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing\nits windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more\nwild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered\nthe girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi\' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the\nchild."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a\nbit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when\nwe are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and\nfollowed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied\nthe room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the\nguide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted\nMorton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him\nfor the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without\nsurprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which\nconducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of\nflat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred\nfeet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot\nover the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but\none sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was\nobstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the\nwaterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured\nwaters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the\neye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open\ncourse.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a\ncavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting\nledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very\nnearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the\nsurrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to\nseek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood\nbeside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the\nfall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not\nhear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which\nthe brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,\nthought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,\nas if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints\nwith the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,\nbut tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had\nrendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by\nnotches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into\nthe chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated\nnot to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and\nfooting in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,\nprevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty\nfeet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,\nhis guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a\nsituation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly\nopposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about\none-quarter\'s depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,\nand three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool\nwhich received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,\nnamely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into\nwhich it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole\ncontinuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was\neddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon\nthat they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the\nincessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce\nthree yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the\nchasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully\nnarrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested\non the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity\nextended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,\nMorton\'s eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection\nglimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling\nwater, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange\npreternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the\nrising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though\neven its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his\nsleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for\nhearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his\nfarther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the\npersecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among\ndells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary\nand secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who\nhad long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and\nothers who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called\nCreehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never\nexactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised\nhow the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained\nconcealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural\nphenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild\ndistrict, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted\npreachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence\nwas carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should\ntraverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,\nand rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the\nchasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to\ngive him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of\nthe rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,\nMorton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye\nfirm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head\nto become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the\nfoam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and\nsafely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small\ncavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,\nproceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the\ninterior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of\nits inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,\nbeing concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no\nmeans have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task\nwhich he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a\ngrisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in\none hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by\nthe light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid\natmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they\ncould be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a\nplace of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of\na man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,\nurged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I\nnot tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as\nthou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which\nrender thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of\nthis book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well\ndone to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--\nArt gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained\nstanding still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;\n"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun\'s ower the hill; ye may\ngang in and speak wi\' him now.I\'ll wait for you at the other side of the\nlinn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton\npresented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first\nexclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an\nexpression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a\ndemoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,\n"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of\nBothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an\nidea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that\nmastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of\nenforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the\nscabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old\nsoldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This\ndone, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to\nhis ordinary discourse:--\n\n"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage\nbefore the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the\nright hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones\nor dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]\n\n\n"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,\n"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my\nheart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton\'s son durst have\nfollowed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of\nNature\'s own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate\noak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss\nbelow, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving\nenemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single\nfight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now\nhave had little need.""What little need, when incarnate\nfiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it\nmatters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place\nof refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of\nlimestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of\nTorwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish\nfever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I\ndoubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person\nwhich I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I\ncan guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of\nLady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that\nbase, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy\noperations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what\nyou have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that\nthy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I\nhave taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still\nhope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich\ninheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek\nto rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of\nthe lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For\nwhose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than\nSamson\'s?""For Lord Evandale\'s and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are\nwilling to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and\nback a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that\never sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed\nEvandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow\nthem with wealth and with heritages, and thou think\'st that there lives\nanother man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally\ncold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,\nand hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none\nbut Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little\nconsequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these\nestates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,\nand strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to\nthe day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose\nwealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive\nhim of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands\nof Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he\ncalled himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he\nwill become what I list while I have in my power the document that may\ndeprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in\nhis nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as\nI think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of\nbestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a\nmalignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the\nworld fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he\nwill see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such\nas he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,\ngoverned by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,\ntherefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work\nin the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I\ncould understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its\njustice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in\nkeeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful\npurpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and\nwhat would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity\nwhich nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon\nthey are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the\nskull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into\nScotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious\nvillain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at\nDrumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain\nwho defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the\nRevolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done\ngreat deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a\ndeliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,\n"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of\nErastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;\nto restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust\nbeside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government\nas now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,\nexcepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you\nwould not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the\ncamp of the malignant Claver\'se, as the future King of Israel sought the\nland of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the\nvillain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--\nI could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping\nthe horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,\nson of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith\nBellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal\nequal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil\nOlifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document\n[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands\nof her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee\nfight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved\nthee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even\nto gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of\njustice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;\nI grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain\nby your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be\nthought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all\nother considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used\nfor the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the\nheap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his\nboot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung\nforward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and\nyounger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually\nprevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a\ncinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,\nrendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive\nof frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk\nfrom its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the\nabyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled\nthe roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou\nart at bay!and standing in the mouth of the\ncavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father\'s life," said\nMorton."I have not yet learned to say the words, \'I yield;\' and my life\nI will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past\nhim, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon\nshare, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of\nthe cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there\nsafe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the\nravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with\nastonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into\nthe interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man\'s mind had\nbeen so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments\nthat it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a\nshade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with\nwhich he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had\nbeen terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;\nand she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would\nexperience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials\nto construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the\nhut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her\ngrandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her\nhome than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin\ne\'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left\nmy hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman\'s horse, and\nlead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,\nhe could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and\nconversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;\nEvandale was a good officer and the soldier\'s friend; and though we were\npunished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own\nwe deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and\nI think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him\nalong with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat\nKing James\'s bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the\nday\'s put off.Halliday\'s seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden\'s fallen sick\nof the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never\nkeep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the\nreward.""That\'s true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this\nBasil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he\nhates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were\nhe once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some\nof our own fellows at his back.""Thou \'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly\ndown at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will\nhave some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are\nus two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,\ncalled Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true\nmilitary conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"\n\n"I\'ll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us\nto Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag\ncrept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse\ninto the hostess\'s hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,\n"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the\nsupport of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I\nmust drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his\nhorse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,\n          Though less and less of Emily he saw;\n          So, speechless for a little space he lay,\n          Then grasp\'d the hand he held, and sigh\'d his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on\nwhich she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden\napparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so\nmuch better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy\nKnowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of\nEdith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the\ncompliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,\nthough it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother\nleaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered\nLady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of\nall that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running\nheadlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will\nnot depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"\nand she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her\nbrother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming\ndownstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily\nreleased from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her\neye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let\nus go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which\nmight have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it\nwas in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They\nfound the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful\ninspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord\nEvandale, and ye maun e\'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,\nsuch as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can\nprovide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see\nyoung folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or\ntheir affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he\nbreakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and\nfifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to\nmy health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, \'Lady Margaret,\nye speak like a Highland oracle.\'These were his Majesty\'s very words;\nso that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to\npress young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady\'s speech failed Lord\nEvandale\'s ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step\nof Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him\nvery dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she\ndelighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in\nthe natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a\nfamily, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to\ncome at everybody\'s whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to\nhear\'t.""It\'s Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch\nof decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in\nhis merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of\ntheir humble fortunes,--"It\'s Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae\'t,\nthat keeps Edie Henshaw\'s kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that\'s him\nthat was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and\nthat--"\n\n"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are\nvery insolent to think I wad speak wi\' a person like that.Let him tell\nhis business to you or Mrs."He\'ll no hear o\' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie\nthe thing to your leddyship\'s ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale\'s, he\nwots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he\'s far frae fresh, and he\'s but\nan idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back\nto-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,\nas an ancient follower o\' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he\'s a\' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie\'s commission, which was\nindeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord\nEvandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the\npractices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else\nto come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of\nprotection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he\nsaw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of\ndollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to\nwhich it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie\'s intermediation, whether as an\nemissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of\nTillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if\nhis employer\'s coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the\nlittle sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale\nand brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak\nwith Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being\nrefused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter\nundelivered, perversely faithful to Morton\'s instructions in the only\npoint in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord\nEvandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who\nonly knew in general that their union had been postponed by her\ngranddaughter\'s indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and\nbridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on\nindifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as\ndeath, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to\nspeak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small\nante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He\nplaced her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of\nthe conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to\narticulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,\nnor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,\nmildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate\ncourse with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite\nof your friends\' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which\nyawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not\ndetain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my\nservants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I\nreach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting\nit.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving\nyour compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;\n"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;\nmy agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on\ndeath and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from\ntime!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most\nungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings\ntowards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to\nconjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection\ntoo powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it\notherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his\ncountenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o\'\nthe house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the\nvillain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he\nbacked by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--\nAnd now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her\ntenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,\nendeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to\nthe front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party\nof horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open\nground before Cuddie\'s cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the\nhouse, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the\nstrength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the\nby-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit\nundervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly\ndown the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down\na gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on\nfoot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up\non the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword\nor halter for meddling with other folk\'s matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that\'s braid Scotch, or I\nwotna what is.Is it ither folk\'s matters to see Lord Evandale murdered\nbefore my face?"But considering on the\nway that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not\nappeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his\nflint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was\ncalled, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant\'s party spread themselves a\nlittle, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,\nsupported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and\nappearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern\nfeatures, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the\nmost formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have\nno difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly\nopposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and\nwas in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant\ncalled out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines\nupon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his\nhand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell\nfrom his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their\ncarabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid\nfellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same\ninstant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord\nEvandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant\'s\nforehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,\nastonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather\ndisposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the\ncontest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses\' hoofs was heard,\nand a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,\nappeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch\ncommandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was\nobeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to\nescape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,\nbeing well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,\nand then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding\nhim, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his\nflight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates\nshut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the\nriver seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the\npistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took\neffect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself\ndangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,\nand returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with\nthe purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing\nat him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little\nway into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared\nthat his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two\nsoldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on\nthe head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a\nstrong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in\nrequital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,\nlosing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were\nswept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which\nbubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman\nstriving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his\ndesire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a\nquarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour\'s grasp could not have been\nunclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty\ngrave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,\n     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and\n     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to\n     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of\n     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see\n     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--\n\n               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,\n               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,\n               Who stirred up to vengeance take,\n               For Solemn League and Cov\'nant\'s sake,\n               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,\n               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate\'s life;\n               By Dutchman\'s hands was hacked and shot,\n               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of\nthe brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung\nhimself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying\nfriend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,\nand, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to\nthe house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon\nsurrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady\nEmily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;\nnor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had\nrestored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their\nhands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,\nraised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and\nexpired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to\nthe reader\'s imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take\nplace after Lord Evandale\'s death.But as I was aware that precedents are\nwanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers\nand compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,\nwhen fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss\nMartha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of\nmantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great\nsuccess, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this\ndescription, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning\nbefore I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must\nhave acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating\nlibraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a\npalpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much\ndisposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her\nspectacles, "by any novel, excepting the \'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny\nJessamy\', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a\nformal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as\nyou will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius\nof the author of \'Julia de Roubignd,\' never let the end be altogether\noverclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is\nquite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your\ninjunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness\nto be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and\ndaughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to\nbe particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your\nobjection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future\nfelicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a\nnarrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a\nconclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is\nnecessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the\none is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar\nusually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,\ngrowing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of\ncircumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the\nauthor exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I\nmay say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the\nconclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice\nwho had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And\nif you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the\nmarriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of\nthe story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that\nyou will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can\nsatisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances\nindeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret\nget back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to\nher worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by\nhis death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,\nwhom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;\nand Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the\nmains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,\nwith the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of\nhaving fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in\ntheir original habitations.\'After a\',\' he said to Jenny, who was his\nonly confidant, \'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy\'s cousin and a grand\ngentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for\nhe ne\'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and\nthough I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it\'s\njust as weel to keep a calm sough about it.\'He not only did so, but\ningeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the\ndeed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,\nwho, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to\nexaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was\nprovided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide\nto the Linn; and--"\n\n"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal\npersonages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her\nsnuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several\nmonths, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale\'s\ndeath."I hope not without Lady Margaret\'s consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their\nparents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their\ncountenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the\nstory; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low\nbirth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to\ncountenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely\nwith her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see\nher happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,\nstood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other\nrespect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and\nconsoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as\nwas observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the\nSecond of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her\ngrand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his\ntime, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back\nand only one eye.This was his Majesty\'s observation, she said, on one\nremarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"\n\n"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such\nauthority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no\nmore to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What\'s her name, the\nhousekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the\nparty; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton\ndined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings\nbeing all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick\nset on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the\nroom for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it\ncame about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the\nother six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all\nthe year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all\npersuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,\nand died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,\nma\'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"\n\n"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose\nministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the\nnarrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the\nfamiliarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned\nScheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every\ncircumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,\nbut am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias\nCalf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right\nleg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was\nstudying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and\nwished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied\nher with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you\nmy thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the\nliberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my\nLandlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of\ntomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,\ncontaining the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was\napprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not\napprove of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)\nextending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four\nbeing published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were\ncapable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,\nand more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have\nbeen already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be\nthe heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my\npossession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the\nremainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning\npublic.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,\n\nJEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM.[Illustration: Interior of Abbotsford--302]\n\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY.Aught, own, possessed of; also,

to\nChiavenna, subject to the Grisons, who abhor the very name of the\nInquisition, and are ever ready to receive and protect all who, flying\nfrom it, take refuge, as many Italians do, in their dominions.Still\nI carefully concealed who I was, and whence I came, for, though no\nInquisition prevails among the Swiss, yet the Pope\'s nuncio who resides\nat Lucerne, (a popish canton through which I was to pass,) might have\npersuaded the magistrate to stop me as an apostate and deserter from the\norder.Having rested a few days at Chiavenna, I resumed my journey quite\nrefreshed, continuing it through the country of the Grisons, and the two\nsmall cantons of Ury and Underwald, to the canton of Lucerne.There\nI missed my way, as I was quite unacquainted with the country, and\ndiscovering a city at a distance, was advancing to it, but slowly, as I\nknew not where I was, when a countryman whom I met, informed me that the\ncity before me was Lucerne.Upon that intelligence, I turned out of the\nroad as soon as the countryman was out of sight, and that night I\npassed with a good natured shepherd in his cottage, who supplied me with\nsheep\'s milk, and my horse with plenty of grass.I set out early next\nmorning, making my way westward, as I knew that Berne lay west of\nLucerne.But, after a few miles, the country proved very mountainous,\nand having travelled the whole day over mountains I was overtaken among\nthem by night.As I was looking out for a place where I might shelter\nmyself during the night, against the snow and rain, (for it both snowed\nand rained,) I perceived a light at a distance, and making towards it,\nI got into a kind of foot-path, but so narrow and rugged that I was\nobliged to lead my horse, and feel my way with one foot, (having no\nlight to direct me,) before I durst move the other.Thus, with much\ndifficulty I reached the place where the light was, a poor little\ncottage, and knocking at the door, was asked by a man within who I was,\nand what I wanted?I answered that I was a stranger and had lost my way.exclaimed the man, "There is no way here to lose."I\nthen asked him what canton I was in?and upon his answering that I was\nin the canton of Berne, I cried out transported with joy, "I thank God\nthat I am."The good man answered, "And so do I."I then told him who I\nwas, and that I was going to Berne but had quite lost myself by keeping\nout of all the high roads, to avoid falling into the hands of those\nwho sought my destruction.He thereupon opened the door, received and\nentertained me with all the hospitality his poverty would admit of;\nregaled me with sour crout and some new laid eggs, the only provision\nhe had, and clean straw with a kind of rug for a bed, he having no other\nfor himself and wife.The good woman expressed as much good nature as\nher husband, and said many kind things in the Swiss language, which\nher husband interpreted to me in the Italian; for that language he well\nunderstood, having learned it in his youth, while servant in a public\nhome on the borders of Italy, where both languages are spoken.I never\npassed a more comfortable night; and no sooner did I begin to stir in\nthe morning, than the good man and his wife both came to know how\nI rested; and, wishing they had been able to accommodate me better,\nobliged me to breakfast on two eggs, which providence, they said, had\nsent them for that purpose.I took leave of the wife, who seemed most\nsincerely to wish me a good journey.As for the husband, he would by all\nmeans attend me to the high road leading to Berne; which road he said\nwas but two miles distant from that place.But he insisted on my first\ngoing back with him, to see the way I had come the night before; the\nonly way, he said, I could have possibly come from the neighboring\ncanton of Lucerne.I saw it, and shuddered at the danger I had escaped;\nfor I found I had walked and led my horse a good way along a very narrow\npath on the brink of a very dangerous precipice.The man made so\nmany pertinent and pious remarks on the occasion, as both charmed and\nsurprised me.I no less admired his disinterestedness than his piety;\nfor, upon our parting, after he had attended me till I was out of all\ndanger of losing my way, I could by no means prevail upon him to accept\nof any reward for his trouble.He had the satisfaction, he said, of\nhaving relieved me in the greatest distress, which was in itself a\nsufficient reward, and he wished for no other.Having at length got safe into French Flanders, I there repaired to the\ncollege of the Scotch Jesuits at Douay, and discovering myself to the\nrector, I acquainted him with the cause of my sudden departure from\nItaly, and begged him to give notice of my arrival, as well as the\nmotives of my flight to Michael Angelo Tambuvini, general of the order,\nand my very particular friend.The rector wrote as I desired him, to the general, and he, taking no\nnotice of my flight, in his answer, (for he could not disapprove, and\ndid not think it safe to approve of it,) ordered me to continue where I\nwas till further notice.I arrived at Douay early in May, and continued\nthere till the beginning of July, when the rector received a second\nletter from the general, acquainting him that he had been commanded by\nthe congregation of the Inquisition, to order me, wherever I was, back\ninto Italy; to promise me, in their name, full pardon and forgiveness if\nI obeyed, but if I did not obey, to treat me as an apostate.He added,\nthat the same order had been transmitted, soon after my flight, to\nthe nuncios at the different Roman Catholic courts; and he, therefore,\nadvised me to consult my own safety without further delay.Upon the receipt of the general\'s kind letter, the rector was of opinion\nthat I should repair by all means, and without loss of time, to England,\nnot only as the safest asylum I could fly to, in my present situation,\nbut as a place where I should soon recover my native language, and be\nusefully employed, either there or in Scotland.The place being thus\nagreed on, and it being at the same time settled between the rector and\nme, that I should set out the very next morning, I solemnly promised, at\nhis request and desire, to take no kind of notice, after my arrival\nin England, of his having been in any way privy to my flight, or the\ngeneral\'s letter to him.This promise I have faithfully and honorably\nobserved; and should have thought myself guilty of the blackest\ningratitude if I had not observed it, being sensible that, had it been\nknown at Rome, that, either the rector or general had been accessary to\nmy flight, THE INQUISITION WOULD HAVE RESENTED IT SEVERELY IN BOTH.For\nalthough a Jesuit in France, in Flanders, or in Germany, is out of the\nreach of the Inquisition, the general is not; and the high tribunal not\nonly have it in their power to punish the general himself, who resides\nconstantly at Rome, but may oblige him to inflict what punishment they\nplease on any of the order obnoxious to them.The rector went that very night out of town, and in his absence, but not\nwithout his privity, I took one of the horses of the college, early\nnext morning, as if I were going for a change of air, being somewhat\nindisposed, to pass a few days at Lisle; but steering a different\ncourse, I reached Aire that night and Calais the next day.I was there\nin no danger of being stopped and seized at the prosecution of the\nInquisition, a tribunal no less abhorred in France than in England.But being informed that the nuncios at the different courts had been\nordered, soon after my flight, to cause me to be apprehended in Roman\nCatholic countries through which I must pass, as an apostate and\ndeserter from the order, I was under no small apprehension of being\ndiscovered and apprehended as such even at Calais.No sooner, therefore,\ndid I alight at the Inn, than I went down to the quay, and there as I\nwas very little acquainted with the sea, and thought the passage much\nshorter than it is, I endeavored to engage some fishermen to carry me\nthat very night, in one of their small vessels, over to England.This\nalarmed the guards of the harbor, and I should have been certainly\napprehended as a person guilty, or suspected of some great crime,\nfleeing from justice, had not Lord Baltimore, whom I had the good luck\nto meet in the Inn, informed me of my danger, and pitying my condition,\nattended me that moment, with all his company, to the port, and conveyed\nme immediately on board his yacht.There I lay that night, leaving every\nthing I had but the clothes on my back, in the Inn; and the next day his\nLordship set me ashore at Dover, from whence I came in the common stage\nto London.In the year 1706, the Inquisition at Arragon was broken up by the French\ntroops, under the command of the Duke of Orleans.The Holy Inquisitors\nwere driven from their beautiful house, and in answer to their indignant\nremonstrance were told that the king wanted the house to quarter his\ntroops in, and they were therefore compelled to leave it immediately.The doors of the prisons were then thrown open, and among the four\nhundred prisoners who were set at liberty were sixty young women, very\nbeautiful in person, and clad in the richest attire.Anthony Gavin, formerly one of the Roman Catholic priests of Saragossa,\nSpain, relates (in a book published by him after his conversion) that\nwhen travelling in France he met one of those women in the inn at\nRotchfort; the son of the inn-keeper, formerly an officer in the French\narmy, having married her for her great beauty and superior intelligence.In accordance with his request, she freely related to him the incidents\nof her prison life, from which we take the following extract:\n\n"Early the next morning, Mary got up, and told me that nobody was up\nyet in the house; and that she would show me the DRY PAN and the GRADUAL\nFIRE, on condition that I should keep it a secret for her sake as well\nas my own.This I promised, and she took me along with her, and showed\nme a dark room with a thick iron door, and within it an oven and a large\nbrass pan upon it, with a cover of the same and a lock to it.The oven\nwas burning at the time, and I asked Mary for what purpose the pan was\nthere.Without giving me any answer, she took me by the hand and led\nme to a large room, where she showed me a thick wheel, covered on both\nsides with thick boards, and opening a little window in the center of\nit, desired me to look with a candle on the inside of it, and I saw all\nthe circumference of the wheel set with SHARP RAZORS.After that she\nshowed me a PIT FULL OF SERPENTS AND TOADS.Then she said to me, \'Now,\nmy good mistress, I\'ll tell you the use of these things.The dry pan and\ngradual fire are for those who oppose the holy father\'s will, and for\nheretics.They are put naked and alive into the pan, and the cover of it\nbeing locked up, the executioner begins to put in the oven a small fire,\nand by degrees he augmenteth it, till the body is burned to ashes.The\nsecond is designed for those who speak against the Pope and the holy\nfathers.They are put within the wheel, and the door being locked, the\nexecutioner turns the wheel till the person is dead.The third is for\nthose who contemn the images, and refuse to give the due respect and\nveneration to ecclesiastical persons; for they are thrown alive into the\npit, and there they become the food of serpents and toads.\'Then Mary\nsaid to me that another day she would show me the torments for public\nsinners and transgressors of the commandments of holy mother church;\nbut I, in deep amazement, desired her to show me no more places; for the\nvery thought of those three which I had seen, was enough to terrify me\nto the heart.So we went to my room, and she charged me again to be very\nobedient to all commands, for if I was not, I was sure to undergo the\ntorment of the dry pan."Llorente, the Spanish historian and secretary-general of the\nInquisition, relates the following incident: "A physician, Juan de\nSalas, was accused of having used a profane expression, twelve months\nbefore, in the heat of debate.He denied the accusation, and produced\nseveral witnesses to prove his innocence.But Moriz, the inquisitor at\nValladolid, where the charge was laid, caused de Salas to be brought\ninto his presence in the torture-chamber, stripped to his shirt, and\nlaid on a LADDER or DONKEY, an instrument resembling a wooden trough,\njust large enough to receive the body, with no bottom, but having a\nbar or bars to placed that the body bent, by its own weight, into an\nexquisitely painful position.His head was lower than his heels, and the\nbreathing, in consequence, became exceedingly difficult.The poor man,\nso laid, was bound around the arms and legs with hempen cords, each of\nthem encircling the limb eleven times."During this part of the operation they admonished him to confess the\nblasphemy; but he only answered that he had never spoken a sentence\nof such a kind, and then, resigning himself to suffer, repeated the\nAthanasian creed, and prayed to God and our Lady many times.Being\nstill bound, they raised his head, covered his face with a piece of fine\nlinen, and, forcing open the mouth, caused water to drip into it from an\nearthen jar, slightly perforated at the bottom, producing in addition\nto his sufferings from distension, a horrid sensation of choking.But\nagain, when they removed the jar for a moment, he declared that he had\nnever uttered such a sentence; and this he often repeated.They then\npulled the cords on his right leg, cutting into the flesh, replaced the\nlinen on his face, dropped the water as before, and tightened the cords\non his right leg the second time; but still he maintained that he\nhad never spoken such a thing; and in answer to the questions of his\ntormentors, constantly reiterated that he HAD NEVER SPOKEN THOSE WORDS.Moriz then pronounced that the said torture should be regarded as\nbegun, but not finished; and De Salas was released, to live, if he could\nsurvive, in the incessant apprehension that if he gave the slightest\numbrage to a familiar, he would be carried again into the same chamber,\nand be RACKED IN EVERY LIMB."Llorente also relates, from the original records, another case quite as\ncruel and unjust as the above."On the 8th day of December, 1528, one\nCatalina, a woman of BAD CHARACTER, informed the inquisitors that,\nEIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE she had lived in the house with a Morisco named\nJuan, by trade a coppersmith, and a native of Segovia; that she had\nobserved that neither he nor his children ate pork or drank wine, and\nthat, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings they used to wash their\nfeet, which custom, as well as abstinence from pork and wine, was\npeculiar to the Moors.The old man was at that time an inhabitant of\nBenevente, and seventy-one years of age.But the inquisitors at once\nsummoned him into their presence, and questioned him at three several\ninterviews.All that he could tell was, that he received baptism when he\nwas forty-five years of age; that having never eaten pork or drunk wine,\nhe had no taste for them; and that, being coppersmiths, they found it\nnecessary to wash themselves thoroughly once a week.After some other\nexaminations, they sent him back to Benevente, with prohibition to go\nbeyond three leagues\' distance from the town.Two years afterwards the\ninquisitor determined that he should be threatened with torture, IN\nORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO CRIMINATE OTHERS.He was accordingly taken to Valladolid, and in a subterranean chamber,\ncalled the \'chamber, or dungeon, of torment,\' stripped naked, and bound\nto the \'ladder.\'This might well have extorted something like confession\nfrom an old man of seventy-one; but he told them that whatever he might\nsay when under torture would be merely extorted by the extreme anguish,\nand therefore unworthy of belief; that he would not, through fear of\npain, confess what had never taken place.They kept him in close prison\nuntil the next Auto de Fe, when he walked among the penitents, with a\nlighted candle in his hand, and, after seeing others burnt to death,\npaid the holy office a fee of four ducats, and went home, not acquitted,\nbut released.He was not summoned again, as he died soon afterwards."It sometimes happened that an individual was arrested by mistake, and\na person who was entirely innocent was tortured instead of the real or\nsupposed criminal.Bower found related at length\nin the "Annals of the Inquisition at Macerata.""An order was sent from the high tribunal at Rome to all the inquisitors\nthroughout Italy, enjoining them to apprehend a clergyman minutely\ndescribed in that order.One Answering the description in many\nparticulars being discovered in the diocese of Osimo, at a small\ndistance from Macerata, and subject to that Inquisition, he was there\ndecoyed into the holy office, and by an order from Rome SO RACKED AS TO\nLOSE HIS SENSES.In the mean time, the true person being apprehended,\nthe unhappy wretch was dismissed, by a second order from Rome, but he\nnever recovered the use of his senses, NOR WAS ANY CARE TAKEN OF HIM BY\nTHE INQUISITION."It would be easy to fill a volume with such narratives as the above, but\nwe forbear.We are not writing a history of the Inquisition.We simply\nwish to exhibit the true spirit by which the Romanists are actuated in\ntheir dealings with those over whom they have power.We therefore, in\nclosing this chapter of horrors, beg leave to place before our readers\none of the FATHERLY BENEDICTIONS with which, His Holiness, the Pope,\ndismisses his refractory subjects.Does it not show most convincingly\nwhat he would do here in America, if he had, among us, the power he\nformerly possessed in the old world, when the least inadvertent word\nmight perchance seal the doom of the culprit?A POPISH BULL OK CURSE."Pronounced on all who leave the Church of Rome.By the authority of God\nAlmighty, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the undefiled Virgin\nMary, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and of all celestial virtues,\nAngels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim,\nand of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and of all the Apostles and\nEvangelists, of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the holy Lamb\nare found worthy to sing the new song of the Holy Martyrs and Holy\nConfessors, and of all the Holy Virgins, and of all the Saints, together\nwith the Holy Elect of God,--MAY HE BE DAMNED.We excommunicate and\nanathematize him, from the threshold of the holy church of God Almighty.We sequester him, that he may be tormented, disposed, and be delivered\nover with Datham and Abiram, and with those who say unto the Lord,\n\'Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways;\' as a fire is quenched with\nwater, so let the light of him be put out forevermore, unless it shall\nrepent him, and make satisfaction."May the Father who creates man, curse him.May the Son, who suffered\nfor us, curse him!May the Holy Ghost who is poured out in baptism,\ncurse him!May the Holy Cross, which Christ for our salvation,\ntriumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him!"May the Holy Mary, ever Virgin and Mother of God, curse him!May all\nthe Angels, Principalities, and Powers, and all heavenly Armies curse\nhim!May the glorious band of the Patriarchs and Prophets curse him!John the Precursor, and St John the Baptist, and St.Andrew and all other of Christ\'s Apostles together\ncurse him and may the rest of the Disciples and Evangelists who by their\npreaching converted the universe, and the Holy and wonderful company\nof Martyrs and Confessors, who by their works are found pleasing to God\nAlmighty; may the holy choir of the Holy Virgins, who for the honor of\nGod have despised the things of the world, damn him.May all the Saints\nfrom the beginning of the world to everlasting ages, who are found to be\nbeloved of God, damn him!"May he be damned wherever he be, whether in the house or in the alley,\nin the woods or in the water, or in the church!May he be cursed in\nliving or dying!"May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in being hungry, in being\nthirsty, in fasting and sleeping, in slumbering, and in sitting, in\nliving, in working, in resting, and in blood letting!May he be cursed\nin all the faculties of his body!"May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly.May he be cursed in his hair;\ncursed be he in his brains, and his vertex, in his temples, in his\neyebrows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his\nteeth, and grinders, in his lips, in his shoulders, in his arms, and in\nhis fingers."May he be damned in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart, and\npurtenances, down to the very stomach!"May he be cursed in his reins and groins, in his thighs and his hips,\nand in his knees, his legs and his feet, and his toe-nails!"May he be cursed in all his joints, and articulation of the members;\nfrom the crown of the head to the soles of his feet, may there be no\nsoundness!"May the Son of the living God, with all the glory of his majesty, CURSE\nHIM!And may Heaven, with all the powers that move therein, rise\nup against him, and curse and damn him; unless he repent and make\nsatisfaction!Such was the CURSE pronounced on the Rev.Hogan, (a converted Roman\nCatholic priest) a few years since, in Philadelphia.As a further proof of the cruel, persecuting spirit of Catholicism, let\nus glance at a few extracts from their own publications."Children," they say, "are obliged to denounce their parents or\nrelations who are guilty of heresy; ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE\nBURNT.They may refuse them all nourishment, and permit them to die\nwith hunger; or they may KILL THEM as enemies, who violate the rights of\nhumanity.--Escobar, Theolg."A man condemned by the Pope, may be killed wherever he is found.""Children may kill their parents, if they would turn their children\nfrom the Popish faith.""If a judge decide contrary to law, the injured\nperson may defend himself by killing the judge."--Fangundez Precept\nDecal, vol."To secretly kill your calumniator, to avoid scandal, is\njustifiable.""You may kill before hand, any person who may put you to death,\nnot EXCEPTING THE JUDGE, AND WITNESSES, because it is\nself-defence.""A priest may kill those who hinder him from taking possession of any\nEcclesiastical office.""You may charge your opponent with false crime to take away his credit,\nas well as kill him."--Guimenius, prop, 8, p."Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.""You may kill any man to save a crown.""BY THE COMMAND OF GOD IT IS LAWFUL TO MURDER THE INNOCENT, TO ROB, AND\nTO COMMIT ALL KIND OF WICKEDNESS, BECAUSE HE IS THE LORD OF LIFE\nAND DEATH, AND ALL THINGS; AND THUS TO FULFILL HIS MANDATE IS OUR\nDUTY."Again, in the Romish Creed found in the pocket of Priest Murphy, who was\nkilled in the battle of Arklow, 1798, we find the following articles."We acknowledge that the priests can make vice virtue, and virtue vice,\naccording to their pleasure."We are bound to believe that the holy massacre was lawful, and lawfully\nput into execution, against Protestants, and likewise WE ARE TO CONTINUE\nTHE SAME, PROVIDED WITH SAFETY TO OUR LIVES!"We are bound not to keep our oaths with heretics, though bound by the\nmost sacred ties.We are bound not to believe their oaths; for their\nprinciples are damnation.We are bound to drive heretics with fire,\nsword, <DW19>, and confusion, out of the land; as our holy fathers say,\nif their heresies prevail we will become their slaves.We are bound\nto absolve without money or price, those who imbrue their hands in\nthe blood of a heretic!"Do not these extracts show very clearly that\nRomanism can do things as bad as anything in the foregoing narrative?Whenever we refer to the relentless cruelties of the Romanists, we are\ntold, and that, too, by the influential, the intelligent, those who are\nwell-informed on other subjects, that "these horrid scenes transpired\nonly in the \'dark ages;\'" that "the civilization and refinement of the\npresent age has so modified human society, so increased the milk of\nhuman kindness, that even Rome would not dare, if indeed she had the\nheart, to repeat the cruelties of by-gone days."For the honor of humanity we could hope that this opinion was correct;\nbut facts of recent date compel us to believe that it is as false as it\nis ruinous to the best interests of our country and the souls of men.A few of these facts, gathered from unquestionable sources, and some of\nthem related by the actors and sufferers themselves, we place before the\nreader.In November, 1854, Ubaldus Borzinski, a monk of the Brothers of Mercy,\naddressed an earnest petition to the Pope, setting forth the shocking\nimmoralities practised in the convents of his order in Bohemia.He specifies nearly forty crimes, mostly perpetrated by priors and\nsubpriors, giving time, place, and other particulars, entreating the\nPope to interpose his power, and correct those horrible abuses.For sending this petition, he was thrown into a madhouse of the Brothers\nof Mercy, at Prague, where he still languishes in dreary confinement,\nthough the only mark of insanity he ever showed was in imagining that\nthe Pope would interfere with the pleasures of the monks.This Ubaldus has a brother, like minded with himself, also a member of\nthe same misnamed order of monks, who has recently effected his escape\nfrom durance vile.John Evangelist Borzinski was a physician in the convent of the Brothers\nof Mercy at Prague.By the\nstudy of the Psalms and Lessons from the New Testament, which make up\na considerable part of the Breviary used in cloisters, he was first\nled into Protestant views.He had been for seventeen years resident in\ndifferent cloisters of his order, as sick-nurse, alms gatherer,\nstudent, and physician, and knew the conventual life out and out.As he\ntestifies: "There was little of the fear of God, so far as I could\nsee, little of true piety; but abundance of hypocrisy, eye-service,\ndeception, abuse of the poor sick people in the hospitals, such love\nand hatred as are common among the children of this world, and the most\nshocking vices of every kind."He now felt disgust for the cloister life, and for the Romish religion,\nand he sought, by the aid of divine grace, to attain to the new birth\nthrough the Word of God.Speaking of his change of views to a Prussian\nclergyman, he thus describes his conversion: "Look you, it was thus I\nbecame a Protestant.I found a treasure in that dustheap, and went away\nwith it."He then thought\nwithin himself, if these detached passages can give such light, what an\nillumination he must receive if he could read and understand the whole\nBible.He did not, however, betray his dissatisfaction, but devoted himself\nto his professional duties with greater diligence.He might still have\nremained in the Order, his life hid with Christ in God, had not the\nhierarchy, under pretence of making reforms and restoring the neglected\nstatutes of the Order, brought in such changes for the worse as led him\nto resolve to leave the order, and the Romish church as well.Following\nhis convictions, and the advice of a faithful but very cautious\nclergyman, he betook himself to the territories of Prussia, where, on\nthe 17th of January, 1855, he was received into the national church at\nPetershain, by Dr.Nowotny, himself formerly a Bohemian priest.This was\nnot done till great efforts had been made to induce him to change his\npurpose, and also to get his person into the power of his adversaries.As he had now left the church of Rome, become an openly acknowledged\nmember of another communion, he thought he might venture to return to\nhis own country.Taking leave of his Prussian friends, to whom he had\ngreatly endeared himself by his modesty and his lively faith, he went\nback to Bohemia, with a heart full of peace and joy.He lived for some time amidst many perplexities, secluded in the house\nof his parents at Prosnitz, till betrayed by some who dwelt in the same\nhabitation.On the 6th of March he was taken out of bed, at eight, by\nthe police, and conveyed first to the cloister in Prosnitz, where he\nsuffered much abuse, and from thence to the cloister in Prague.Here the\ncanon Dittrich, "Apostolical Convisitator of the Order of the Brothers\nof Mercy," justified all the inhuman treatment he had suffered, and\nthreatened him with worse in case he refused to recant and repent.Dittrich not only deprived him of his medical books, but told him that\nhis going over to Protestantism was a greater crime than if he had\nplundered the convent of two thousand florins.He was continually dinned\nwith the cry, "Retract, retract!"He was not allowed to see his brother,\nconfined in the same convent, nor other friends, and was so sequestered\nin his cell as to make him feel that he was forgotten by all the world.He managed, through some monks who secretly sympathized with him, to get\na letter conveyed occasionally to Dr.These letters were filled\nwith painful details of the severities practised upon him.In one of\nthem he says, "My only converse is with God, and the gloomy walls around\nme."He was transferred to a cell in the most unwholesome spot, and\ninfested with noisome smells not to be described.Close by him were\nconfined some poor maniacs, sunk below the irrational brutes.Under date of April 23d he writes: "Every hour, in this frightful\ndungeon seems endless to me.For many weeks have I sat idle in this\ndurance, with no occupation but prayer and communion with God."His\nappeals to civil authority and to the Primate of Hungary procured him no\nredress, but only subjected him to additional annoyances and hardships.His aged father, a man of four-score years, wept to see him, though of\nsound understanding, locked up among madmen; and when urged to make his\nson recant, would have nothing to do with it, and returned the same\nday to his sorrowful home.As he had been notified that he was to be\nimprisoned for life, he prayed most earnestly to the Father of mercies\nfor deliverance; and he was heard, for his prayers and endeavors wrought\ntogether.The sinking of his health increased his efforts to escape;\nfor, though he feared not to die, he could not bear the thought of dying\nimprisoned in a mad-house, where he knew that his enemies would take\nadvantage of his mortal weakness to administer their sacraments to him,\nand give out that he had returned to the bosom of the church, or at\nleast to shave his head, that he might be considered as an insane\nperson, and his renunciation of Romanism as the effect of derangement\nof mind.Several plans of escape were projected, all beset with much\ndifficulty and danger.The one he decided upon proved to be successful.On Saturday, the 13th of October, at half-past nine in the evening, he\nfastened a cord made of strips of linen to the grate of a window, which\ngrate did not extend to the top.Having climbed over this, he lowered\nhimself into a small court-yard.He had now left that part of the\nestablishment reserved for the insane, and was now in the cloistered\npart where the brethren dwelt.He saw\nat a distance a servant of the insane approaching with a light; and\nwith aching heart and trembling limbs, by a desperate effort, climbed\nup again.He returned to his cell, concealing his cord, and laid himself\ndown to rest.On the following Monday, he renewed his efforts to escape.He lowered\nhimself, as before, into the little court-yard; but being weak in health\nand much shaken in his nervous system by all he had suffered in body and\nmind, he was seized with palpitation of the heart and trembled all over,\nso that he could not walk a step.He laid down to rest and recover his\nbreath.He felt as if he could get no further."But," he says in his\naffecting narrative, "My dear Saviour to whom I turned in this time of\nneed, helped me wonderfully.I felt now, more than ever in my life, His\ngracious and comforting presence, and believed, in that dismal moment,\nwith my whole soul, His holy word;" "My grace is sufficient for thee;\nfor my strength is made perfect in weakness."Borzinski now arose, pulled off his boots, and though every step was\nmade with difficulty, he ascended the stairs leading to the first story.He went along the passage way until he came to a door leading into\ncorridors where the cloister brethren lodged.But the trembling fit came\nover him again, with indescribable anguish, as he sought to open the\ndoor with a key with which he had been furnished.He soon rallied again,\nand, like a spectre, gliding by the doors of the brethren, who occupied\nthe second and third corridors, many of whom had lights still burning,\nhe came with his boots in one hand, and his bundle in the other, to\na fourth passage way, in which was an outside window he was trying to\nreach.The cord was soon fastened to the window frame, yet still in\nbitter apprehension; for this window was seldom opened, and opened\nhard, and with some noise.It was also only two steps distant from the\napartment of the cloister physician, where there was a light, and it was\nmost likely that, on the first grating of the window, he would rush\nout and apprehend the fugitive.However the window was opened without\nraising any alarm, and now it was necessary to see that no one was\npassing below; for though the spot is not very much frequented, yet\nthe streets cross there, and people approach it from four different\ndirections.During these critical moments, one person and another kept\npassing, and poor Borzinski tarried shivering in the window for near a\nquarter of an hour before he ventured to let himself down.While he\nwas waiting his opportunity he heard the clock strike the third quarter\nafter nine and knew that he had but fifteen minutes to reach the house\nwhere he was to conceal himself, which would be closed at ten.When all\nwas still, he called most fervently on the Saviour, and grasping the\ncord, slid down into the street.He could scarce believe his feet were\non the ground.Trembling now with joy and gratitude rather than fear, he\nran bareheaded to his place of refuge, where he received a glad welcome.Having changed his garb, and tarried till three o\'clock in the morning,\nhe took leave of his friends and passing through the gloomy old capital\nof Bohemia, he reached the Portzitscher Gate, in order to pass out\nas early as possible.Just then a police corporal let in a wagon, and\nBorzinski, passed out unchallenged.It is needless to follow him further\nin his flight.We have given enough, of his history to prove that\nconventual establishments are at this moment what they ever have\nbeen--dangerous alike to liberty and life.AMERICAN AND FOREIGN\nCHRISTIAN UNION.In place of labored arguments we give the following history of personal\nsuffering as strikingly illustrative of the spirit of Romanism at the\npresent day.APPENDIX VII\n\nNARRATIVE OP SIGNORINA FLORIENCIA D\' ROMANI, A NATIVE OF THE CITY OF\nNAPLES.I was born in the year 1826, of noble and wealthy parents.Our mansion\ncontained a small chapel, with many images, sacred paintings, and a\nneatly furnished mass altar.As he lived on the rents and income\nof his estates, he had little to do, except to amuse himself with his\nfriends.My mother, who was of as mild and sweet disposition, loved my\nfather very dearly, but was very unhappy the most of the time because\nmy father spent so much of his time in drinking with his dissolute\ncompanions, card playing, and in balls, parties, theatres, operas,\nbilliards, &c. Father did not intend to be unkind to my mother, for he\ngave her many servants, and abundance of gold, horses, carriages and\ngrooms, and said frequently in my hearing, that his wife should be as\nhappy as a princess.Such was the state of society in Italy that men\nthought their wives had no just reason to complain, so long as they were\nfurnished with plenty of food, raiment and shelter.One of my father\'s most intimate friends was the very Rev.Father\nSalvator, a Priest of the order of St.Francis; he wore the habit of\nthe order, his head was about half shaved.The sleeves of his habit were\nvery large at the elbow; in these sleeves he had small pockets, in which\nhe usually carried his snuff box, handkerchief, and purse of gold.This\npriest was merry, full of fun and frolic; he could dance, sing, play\ncards, and tell admirably funny stories, such as would make even the\ndevils laugh in their chains.Such was the influence and power this Franciscan had over my father and\nmother, that in our house, his word was law.He was our confessor, knew\nthe secrets and sins, and all the weak points of every mind in the whole\nhousehold.My own dear mother taught me to read before I was seven years\nof age.As I was the only child, I was much petted and caressed, indeed,\nsuch was my mother\'s affection for me that I was seldom a moment out of\nher sight.There was a handsome mahogany confessional in our own chapel.When the priest wanted any member of the household to come to him to\nconfession, he wrote the name on a slate that hung outside the chapel\ndoor, saying that he would hear confessions at such a time to-morrow.Thus, we would always have time for the full examination of our\nconsciences.Only one at a time was ever admitted into the chapel, for\nconfessional duty, and the priest always took care to lock the door\ninside and place the key in his sleeve pocket.My mother and myself were\nobliged to confess once a week; the household servants, generally once a\nmonth.My father only once a year, during Lent, when all the inhabitants\nof seven years, and upwards, are obliged to kneel down to the priests,\nin the confessional, and receive the wafer God under the severest\npenalties.Woe to the individual who resists the ecclesiastical mandate.When I was about fourteen years of age, I was sent to the Ursuline\nConvent, to receive my education.My dear mother would have preferred\na governess or a competent teacher to teach me at home but her will was\nbut a mere straw in the hands of our confessor and priestly tyrant.It\nwas solely at the recommendation of the confessor, that I was imprisoned\nfour years in the Ursuline Convent.As my confessor was also the\nconfessor of the convent, he called himself my guardian and protector,\nand recommended me to the special care of the Mother Abbess, and her\nholy nuns, the teachers, who spent much of their time in the school\ndepartment.As my father paid a high price, quarterly, for my tuition\nand board, I had a good room to myself, my living was of the best kind,\nand I always had wine at dinner.The nuns, my teachers, took much more\npains to teach me the fear of the Pope, bishops and confessors, than\nthe fear of God, or the love of virtue.In fact, with the exception of a\nlittle Latin and embroidery, which I learned in those four years, I came\nout as ignorant as I was before, unless a little hypocrisy may be called\na useful accomplishment.For, of all human beings on earth, none can\nteach hypocrisy so well as the Romish priests and nuns.In the school\ndepartment young ladies seldom have much to complain of, unless they are\ncharity scholars; in that case the poor girls have to put up with very\npoor fare, and much hard work, hard usage and even heavy blows; how my\nheart has ached for some of those unfortunate girls, who are treated\nmore like brutes, than human beings, because they are orphans, and poor.Yet they in justice are entitled to good treatment, for thousands of\nscudi (dollars) are sent as donations to the convents for the support\nof these orphans, every year, by benevolent individuals.So that as poor\nand unfortunate as these girls are, they are a source of revenue to the\nconvents.For the first three years of my convent life, I passed the time in\nthe school department, without much anxiety of mind.I was gay and\nthoughtless, my great trouble was to find something to amuse myself,\nand kill time in some way.Though I treated all the school-mates with\nkindness, and true Italian politeness, I became intimate with only one.She was a beautiful girl, from the dukedom of Tuscany.She made me her\nconfidant, and told me all her heart.Her parents were wealthy, and both\nvery strict members of the Romish Church.But she had an aunt in the\ncity of Geneva, who was a follower of John Calvin, or a member of the\nChristian church of Switzerland.This aunt had been yearly a visitor at\nher father\'s house.She being her father\'s only sister, an affectionate\nintimacy was formed between the aunt and niece.The aunt, being a very\npious, amiable woman, felt it her duty to impress the mind of the niece,\nwith the superiority of the religion of the holy bible over popish\ntraditions; and the truth of the Scriptures soon found its way to the\nheart of my young friend.But her confessor soon found out that some\nchange was going on in her mind, and told her father.There were\nonly two ways to save her soul from utter ruin; one was to give her\nabsolution and kill her before she got entirely out of the holy mother\nchurch; the other, was to send her to the Ursuline convent at Naples,\nwhere by the zeal and piety of those celebrated nuns, she might be\nsecured from further heresy.From this, the best friend of my school days, I learned more about God\'s\nword, and virtue, and truth, and the value of the soul, than from all\nother sources.There was a garden surrounded by a high wall, in which we\nfrequently walked, and whispered to each other, though we trembled all\nthe while for fear our confessor would by some means, find out that we\nlooked upon the Romish church as the Babylon destined to destruction,\nplainly spoken of by St.My young friend stood in great fear of the priests; she trembled at the\nvery sight of one.Her aunt had read to her the history and sufferings of the persecuted\nProtestants of Europe.She was a frail, and timid girl, yet such was the\ndepth of her piety and the fervor of her religious faith, that she often\ndeclared to me that she would prefer death to the abandonment of those\nheavenly principles she had embraced, which were the source of her\njoy and hope.Her aunt gave her a pocket New Testament, in the Italian\nlanguage, which she prized above all the treasures of earth, and carried\nwith her carefully, wherever she went.I borrowed it and read it every\nopportunity I had.I took much\npains to commit to memory all I could of the blessed book, for in\ncase of our separation, I knew not where I could obtain another.My\ngod-father who was a bishop, called to see me on my fifteenth birth day,\nand presented me with a splendid gold watch and chain richly studded\nwith jewels, made in England, and valued at 200 scudi, saying that\nhe had it imported expressly for my use.I had also several diamond\narticles of jewelry, presents I had received from my father from time to\ntime.I had also, in my purse, 100 scudi in gold, which I had saved from\nmy pin money.All the above property, I should have cheerfully given for\na copy of the Holy Bible, in my own beautiful Italian language.A few\nmonths after I received the rich present from the Bishop, he called with\nmy father and my confessor to see me.My heart almost came into my mouth\nwhen I saw them alight from my father\'s carriage, and enter the chapel\ndoor of the convent.Very soon the lady porter came to me and said,\n"Signorina, you are wanted in the parlor."As my Tuscan friend had taught me to pray, and ask the Lord Jesus for\ngrace and strength, I walked into my room, locked the door, and on my\nknees, called upon the Lord to save me from becoming a nun--for I\nknew then it was a determination on the part of the Abbess, bishop\nand confessor, that I should take the veil.I was the only child, and\nheiress of an immense fortune, of course, too good a prize to be lost.After a short and fervent prayer to my Lord and Saviour, I walked down\nto see what was to be my doom.I kissed my father\'s cheek, and kissed\nthe hands of the Bishop and confessor--yet my very soul revolted\nfrom the touch of these whited sepulchres.All received me with great\ncordiality, yea, even more than usual affection.Soon after our meeting,\nmy father asked permission of the Bishop to speak to me privately and\ntaking me into a small room, said to me, "My dear daughter, you are not\naware of the great misfortune that has recently come upon your father.While I was excited with wine at the card-table last evening, betting\nhigh and winning vast sums of money, I so far forgot myself and my duty\nto the laws of the country, that I called for a toast, and induced\na number of my inebriated companions to drink the health of Italian\nliberty, and we all drank and gave three cheers for liberty and a\nliberal constitution.A Benedictine Friar being present, took all our\nnames to the Commissary General, and offered to be a witness against\nus in the King\'s Court.As this is my first and only offence, the holy\nBishop your god-father offers on certain conditions, to visit Rome\nimmediately on my behalf, and secure the mediation of the holy Father\nPius IX.Your venerable god-father has great influence at Rome, being\na special favorite with his holiness, and his holiness can obtain any\nfavor he asks of King Ferdinand.So if you will only consent to take the\nBlack Veil, your father will be saved from the State prison."This was terrible news to my young and palpitating heart.It was the\nfirst heavy blow that I had experienced in this vale of tears.I did not\nspeak for some minutes; I could not.My trembling bosom heaved like the\nwaves of the ocean before the blast.My veins were almost bursting; my\nhands and feet became as cold as marble, and when I attempted to speak\nmy words seemed ready to choke me to death.I fell upon my knees and called upon God for mercy and help.My\nfather, thinking I had gone mad, was greatly alarmed.The Bishop\nand confessor, who were anxiously waiting the result of my father\'s\nproposition, hearing my father weep and sob aloud, came in to see what\nthe matter was.In the midst of my prayer, I fainted away, and became\nentirely unconscious.When I came to myself, I found myself on the bed.As I opened my eyes, it all seemed like a dream.The abbess spoke to me\nvery kindly, and sprinkled my bed with holy water, and at the same time\nlaid a large bronze crucifix on my breast, saying that Satan must be\ndriven from my soul, for had it not been for the devil, I would have\nleaped for joy, and not fainted when father mentioned the black veil."No," said the holy mother, "had it not been for the devil you would\nrejoice to take the holy black veil blessed by the Holy Madonna and the\nblessed saints Clara and Theresa.It is a holy privilege that very few\ncan enjoy on earth.Yea, my daughter, there can not be a greater sin\nin the sight of the Madonna and the blessed saints, than to reject a\nsecluded life.Yea," said the crafty old nun, (who was thinking much\nmore about my gold, than my soul,) "I never knew a young lady who had\nthe offer of becoming a nun and rejected it, who ever came to a good\nend.If they refuse, and marry, they generally die in child-bed with the\nfirst child, or they will marry cruel husbands, who beat them and kill\nthem by inches.Therefore, dear daughter, let me most affectionately\nwarn you as you have had the honor of being selected by the holy Bishop\nand our holy confessor to the high dignity and privilege of a professed\nnun, of the order of St.Ursula, reject it not at your peril.Be\nassured, heaven knows how to punish such rebellion."My head ached so violently at the time, and I was so feverish that I\nbegged the old woman to send for my mother, and to talk to me no more on\nthe subject of the black veil, but to drop it until some future time.In\nmy agony on account of the foul plot against my liberty, my virtue, and\nmy gold, I felt such a passion of rage come upon me, that had I absolute\npower for the moment I would have cast every Abbess, Pope, Bishop and\nPriest into the bottomless pit.May the Lord forgive me, but I would\nhave done it at that time with a good will.The greatest comfort I now\nhad was reading my Tuscan friend\'s New Testament, or hearing it read by\nher when we had a chance to be by ourselves, which was not very often.In the evening of the same day of my illness, father and mother came to\nsee me, and Satan came also in the shape of the confessor; so that I\nhad not a moment alone with my dear parents.The confessor feared my\ndetermined opposition to a convent\'s life, for he had previous to this,\nseveral times in the confessional, dropped hints to me on the great\nhappiness, purity, serenity and joy of all holy nuns.But I always told\nhim I would not be a nun for the world.I should be so good, it would\nkill me in a short time."No, no, father," said I, "I WILL NOT BE A\nNUN."Father spoke to me again of his great misfortune--told me that his trial\nwould come on in a few days and that he was now at liberty on a\nvery heavy bail; that the Bishop was only waiting my answer to start\nimmediately for the holy city, and throw himself at the feet of the holy\nPope to procure father\'s unconditional pardon from the King.I said\n"my dear father, how long will you be imprisoned if you do not get a\npardon?""From two to five years," he replied."My daughter, it is\nmy first offence, and I have witnesses to prove that the priest who\nappeared against me, urged me to drink wine several times after I had\ndrank a large quantity, and was the direct cause of my saying what\nI did."Now it all came to me, that the whole of it was a plot, a\nJesuitical trick, to get my father in the clutches of the law, and then\nmake a slave of me for life through my sympathy for my dear father.The vile priests knew that I loved my father most ardently; in fact, my\nfather and mother were the only two beings on earth that I did love.My\nmother I loved most tenderly, but my affection for my father was of a\ndifferent kind.I loved him most violently, with all the ardor of my\nsoul.Mother seemed all the home to me; but father was to me all the\nworld beside.He would frequently\ncome home, and get me to go out into the garden and play with him,\njust as though he was my brother.There we would swing, run, jump and\nexercise in several healthy games, common in our climate.He never gave\nme an unkind word or an unkind reproof.If I did say anything wrong, he\nwould take me to my mother and say, "Clara, here I bring you a prisoner,\nlet her be kept on bread and water till dinner time."Even when mother\nhad displeased him about some trifle, so that he had not a smile for\nher, he always had a smile for his Flora.Even now, while I write, a\nchill comes over my frame, while I think of that vile Popish plot.I\nsaid to my father, "You shall not be imprisoned if I can prevent it; at\nthe same time I do not see any great gain, comfort or profit in having\nyour only daughter put in prison for life, without the hope of liberty\never more, to save you from two years imprisonment."At these words, the eyes of the confessor flashed like lurid lightnings;\nhis very frame shook, as though he had the fever and ague.Truth seemed\nso strange to the priest, that he found it hard of digestion.Father\nand mother both wept, but made no reply.The idea of putting their only\nchild in a dungeon for life, though it might be done in the sacred name\nof religion, did not seem to give them much comfort "Father," said I, "I\nwish to see you at ten o\'clock to-morrow morning, without fail--I wish\nto see you alone; don\'t bring mother or any one else with you.You shall\nnot go to prison, all will yet be well."On account of this reasonable\nrequest, to see my father alone, the confessor arose in a terrible rage\nand left the apartment As quick as the mad priest left us to ourselves,\nI told my father my plan, or what I would like to do with his\npermission.My plan was, for my mother and myself to get into our\ncarriage and drive to the palace of King Ferdinand and make him\nacquainted with all the truth; for I was aware from what I had heard,\nthat the King had heard only the priest\'s side of the story.My father\nstood in such fear of the priests that he only consented to my plan with\ngreat reluctance, saying that we ought first to make our plan known to\nthe confessor, lest he should be offended.To this my mother responded,\nsaying, "My daughter, it would be very wrong for us to go to the King,\nor take any step without the advice of our spiritual guide."Here,\nI felt it to be my duty to reveal to my deceived parents some of the\nsecrets of the confessional, though I might, in their estimation,\nbe guilty of an unpardonable sin by breaking the seal of iniquity.I\nrevealed to my parents the frequent efforts of the priest to obtain my\nconsent to take the veil, and that I had opposed from first to last,\nevery argument made use of to rob me of the society of my parents, of my\nliberty, and of everything I held dear on earth.As to the happiness of\nthe nuns so much talked of by the priests, from what I had seen in their\ndaily walk and general deportment, I was fully convinced that there was\nno reality in it; they were mere slaves to their superiors, and not half\nso happy as the free slaves on a plantation who have a kind master.My\nparents saw my determination to resist to the death every plan for my\nimprisonment in the hateful nunnery.Therefore they promised that I\nshould have the opportunity to see the King on the morrow in company\nwith my mother.On the following day, at twelve o\'clock, we left the convent in our\ncarriage for the palace.We were very politely received by the gentleman\nusher, who conducted us to seats in the reception-room.After sending\nour cards to the king, we waited nearly one hour before he made his\nappearance.His majesty received us with much kindness, raised us\nimmediately from our knees, and demanded our business.I was greatly\nembarrassed at first, but the frank and cordial manner of the sovereign\nsoon restored me to my equilibrium, and I spoke freely in behalf of my\ndear father.The king heard me through very patiently, with apparent\ninterest, and said, "Signorina, I am inclined to believe you have spoken\nthe truth; and as your father has always been a good loyal subject, I\nshall, for your sake, forgive him this offence; but let him beware that\nhenceforth, wine or no wine, he does not trespass against the laws\nof the kingdom, for a second offence I will not pardon.Go in peace,\nsignoras, you have my royal word."We thanked his majesty, and returned to our home with the joyful\ntidings.My father, who had been waiting the\nresult of our visit to the palace with great impatience, received us\nwith open arms, and pressed us to his heart again and again.I was so excited that, long before we got to him, I cried out, "All is\nwell, all is well, father.We drove\nhome, and father went immediately to spread the happy news amongst\nhis friends.All our faithful domestics, including my old affectionate\nnurse, were so overjoyed at the news that they danced about like\nmaniacs.My father was always a very indulgent and liberal master,\nfurnished his servants with the best of Italian fare, plenty of\nfresh beef, wine, and macaroni.We had scarcely got rested, when our\ntormenter, the confessor, came into our room and said, "Signoras, what\nis the meaning of all this fandango and folly amongst the servants?ARE\nTHE HERETICS ALL KILLED, that there should be such joy, or has the queen\nbeen delivered of a son, an heir to the throne?"My dear mother was now as pale as death, and silent, for she saw that\nthe priest was awfully enraged; for, although he feigned to smile, his\nsmile was similar to that of the hyena when digging his prey out of\nthe grave.The priest\'s dark and villainous visage had the effect of\nconfirming in my mother\'s mind all the truth regarding the plot to\nenslave me for life, and secure all my father\'s estate to the pockets\nof the priests.The confessor was now terribly mad, for two obvious\nreasons: one was because he was not received by us with our usual\ncordiality and blind affection; the other, because, by the king\'s\npardon, I was not under the necessity to sacrifice my liberty and\nhappiness for life to save my father from prison; and what tormented him\nthe most was, that he believed that I, though young, could understand\nand thwart his hellish plans.As my mother trembled and was silent,\nfearing the priest was cursing her and her only daughter in his\nheart,--for the priests tell such awful stories about the effects of a\npriest\'s curse that the great mass of the Italian people fear it more\nthan the plague or any earthly misfortune.Peter is the doorkeeper of the great\ncity of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, that he has the keys of the kingdom\nof heaven, and has received strict orders not to admit any soul, under\nany circumstances, who has been cursed by a holy priest, unless that\ncurse has been removed by the same priest in the tribunal of penance.I\nwas obliged to speak to his reverence, and I felt so free, so happy in\nChrist as my only hope, that I opened my mind to the priest very freely,\nand told him what I thought of him and his plot."Sir priest," said I,\n"I shall never return to the convent to stay long.As soon as the time\nfor my education ends, I shall return to liberty and domestic life.I\nam not made of the proper material to make a nun of.I love the social\ndomestic circle; I love my father and mother, and all our domestics,\neven the dogs and the cats, pigeons, and canaries, the fish-ponds,\nplay-grounds, gardens, rivers, and landscapes, mountain and ocean,--all\nthe works of God I love.I shall live out of the convent to enjoy these\nthings; therefore, reverend sir, if you value my peace and good-will,\nnever speak to me or my parents on the subject of my becoming a nun in\nany convent.I shall prefer death to the loss of my personal liberty."I was so decided, and had received such strength and grace from heaven,\nthat the priest was dumbfounded,--my smooth stone out of the sling\nhad hit him in the right place.After much effort to appear bland and\ngood-natured, he drew near my chair, seized my hand, and said, "My dear\ndaughter, you mistake me.I love you as a daughter, I wish only your\nhappiness.Your god-father, the holy Bishop, does not intend that you\nshall remain a common nun more than a year.After the first year you\nshall be raised to the highest dignity in the convent.You shall be the\nLady Superior, and all the nuns shall bow at your feet, and implicitly\nobey your commands.Clara is now very old, and his lordship wishes\nsoon to fill her place.For that purpose he has selected his adopted\ndaughter.Your talents, education, wealth, and high position in society,\neminently fit you for one of the highest dignities on earth.""A thousand thanks for the kindness of my lord Bishop," said I; "but\nyour reverence has not altered my mind in the least.I can never bow\ndown to the feet of any Lady Superior, neither will I ever consent to\nsee a single human being degraded at my feet.The holy Bible says, \'Thou\nshalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\'"exclaimed the priest, "Where did you see that dangerous\nbook?Know you not that his holiness the Pope has placed it in the\nIndex Expurgatorius, because it has been the means of the damnation of\nmillions of souls?Not because it is in itself a bad book, but because\nit is a theological work, prepared only for the priests and ministers of\nour holy religion.Therefore, it is always a very dangerous book in\nthe hands of women or laymen, who wrest the Scriptures to their own\ndestruction.""Well, reverend sir," I replied, "you seem determined to differ from the\nLord Jesus and his apostles.I read in the New Testament that we should\nsearch the Scriptures because they testify of Christ.And one of the\napostles, I don\'t remember which, said, \'all scripture is given by the\ninspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for instruction\nin righteousness.\'Now, reverend sir, if the people have souls, as well\nas the priests, why should they not read the word of God which speaks of\nChrist and is profitable for instruction?"exclaimed the priest, "and you talk very\nmuch like one."His countenance changed to a pale sickly hue, as he\nsaid, "My daughter, where did you get that dangerous book?If you have,\nit in your possession, give it to me, and I will bless you, and pray for\nyou to the blessed Madonna that she may save you from the infernal pit\nof heresy.""I do not own the blessed book," said I, "but I wish I did.I would give\none hundred scudi in gold for a copy of the New Testament.I borrowed a\ncopy from a friend, and returned it to the owner again.But I understand\nthat there are copies to be had in London, and when I have a good\nopportunity I shall send for a copy, if I can do it unbeknown to any\none.""I shall be in the tribunal of\npenance at six o\'clock P.M.You need\npardon immediately, and spiritual advice.Should you die as you now are\nwithout absolution, you would be lost and damned forever.I tremble for\nyou, my dear daughter, seeing that the devil has got such a powerful\nhold of you.It may even be absolutely necessary to kill the body to\nsave your soul; for should you relapse again into heresy after due\npenance for this crime has been performed, it would be impossible to\nrenew you again to repentance, seeing you crucify the Lord and the\nMadonna afresh, and put them to an open shame."Here my mother fainted and shook like an aspen leaf.But God gave me\nstrength, and I said in a moment that as his reverence thought my sins\nso great, I would not go to any man, no, not even to the Pope; I\nwould go to God alone, and leave my cause in his hands, life or death."Therefore, reverend sir, I shall save you from all further trouble in\nattending the confessional any more on my account.From henceforth no\nearthly power shall drag me alive and with my consent to the tribunal of\npenance."exclaimed the priest furiously, "are you mad?There are ten\nthousand devils in you, and we must drive them out by some means."After\nthis discharge of priestly venom, the priest left in a rage giving the\ndoor a terrible slam, which awoke my mother from her sorrowful trance.During the whole conversation, such was the electrical power of the\npriest over my mother\'s weak and nervous system, that if she attempted\nto say a word in my behalf, the keen, snakish black eye of the priest\nwould at once make her tremble and quail before him, and the half\nuttered word would remain silent on her lips.The priest went at once\nin search of my father.He came home boiling over with rage, saying he\nwished I had never been born.The\ncause of all this paternal fury upon my poor devoted head was the foul\nmisrepresentations of my father confessor, who was now in league with\nthe Bishop, both determined to shut me up in a prison convent, or end my\nmortal career.My poor mother remained mute and heart-broken.My sweet mother; never\ndid she utter one word of unkindness to me; her very look to the last\nwas one of gentleness and love.But my father loved honor and reputation\namongst men above all other things.The idea of being the father of an\naccursed heretic, tormented his pride, and he being suspected of heresy\nhimself caused him to be forsaken by many of his proud friends and\nacquaintances.He was even insulted in the streets by the numerous\nLazaroni, with the epithet of Maldito Corrobonari, so that I lost my\nfather\'s love.And when the confessor told him there was no other way\nto save me from hell than an entire life of penance in a convent, he\nheartily and freely gave his consent.Mother, my own sweet mother, my\nonly remaining friend, turned as pale as death, but was enabled to say a\nword in my behalf.I saw that my earthly doom was sealed; there was not a single voice in\nall Naples to save me from imprisonment for life.Not a tongue in four\nhundred thousand that would dare speak one word in my behalf.Father\ncommanded me to get ready to leave his house forever that very night,\nsaying the carriage and confessor would be on hand to take me away at\neight o\'clock P.M., by moonlight.I got on my knees and begged my father\nas a last request that he would allow me to remain three days with my\nmother, but he refused.Said he, "That is now beyond my power.Not an\nhour can you remain after eight o\'clock."As I knew not when I should see my Tuscan friend again, I begged the\nprivilege of seeing her for a few moments.I was anxious to ask her\nprayers and sympathy, and to put her on her guard, for should the\npriests discover her New Testament, they would punish her as they did\nme, or as they intended to do to me.But this favor was denied me, and I\ncould not write to her, for all letters of the scholars in the\nconvents, are opened under the pretence to prevent them from receiving\nlove-letters.The Romish church keeps all her dark plans a secret, but\nnever allows any secret to be kept from the priests.I went into my room to bid farewell to my home forever.I fell on my\nknees and prayed to God for his dear Son\'s sake to help me, to give me\npatience, and to keep me from the sin of suicide.The more I thought\nof my utterly unprotected situation and of the savage disposition of my\nfoes, the priests, the more I thought of the propriety of taking my own\nlife, rather than live in a dungeon all my days.Such was the power of\nsuperstition over our domestics that they looked upon me as one accursed\nof the church, a Protestant heretic, and not one of them would take my\nhand or bid me good bye.At tea-time I was not allowed to sit at table\nwith father, mother, and the confessor, as formerly.But I had my supper\nsent up to my room.A short time after the bell rang for vespers, the carriage being ready,\nmy father and the confessor with myself and one small trunk got into the\nbest seats inside, and rode off at a rapid rate.I kept my veil over my\nface, and said not a word neither did I shed a single tear; my sorrow,\nand indignation was too deep for utterance or even for tears.The priest\nand my father uttered not a word.Perhaps my father\'s conscience\nmade him ashamed of such vile work--that of laying violent hands on a\ndefenceless girl of eighteen years of age, for no crime whatever, only\nthe love of liberty and pure Bible religion.But if the priest was\nsilent, his vile countenance indicated a degree of hellish pleasure and\nsatisfaction.Never did piratical captain glory more in seeing a rich\nprize along side with all hands killed and out of the way, than my\nreverend confessor; yet a short time before he said he loved me as a\ndaughter.Yes, he did love me, as the wolf loves the lamb, as the cat\nloves the mouse and as the boa constrictor the beautiful gazelle.To\nmy momentary satisfaction we entered the big gate of St.Ursula, for\nalthough I knew I should suffer there perhaps even death, there was some\nsatisfaction in seeing a few faces that I had seen in my gay and happy\ndays, now alas!I was somewhat grieved by the cold\nreception I received.But none\nof these things moved me; I looked to God for strength, for I felt that\nHe alone could nerve me for the conflict.The hardest blow of all was,\nmy dear father left me at the mercy of the priest without one kind look\nor word.He did not even shake hands with me, nor did he say farewell.Oh Popery, what a mysterious power is thine!Thou canst in a few hours\ndestroy powerful love which it took long years to cement in loving\nhearts.When my father had left and I heard the porter lock the heavy\niron gate I felt an exquisite wretchedness come over me.I would have\ngiven worlds for death at that moment.In a few moments the priest rung\na bell, and the old Jezebel the mother Abbess made her appearance."Take\nthis heretic, Holy Mother, and place her in confinement in the lower\nregions; GIVE HER BREAD AND WATER ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, THE WATER\nTHAT YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR SACRED FEET IN, NO OTHER; give her straw\nto sleep on, but no pillow.Take all her clothing away and give her a\ncoarse tunic; one single coarse garment to cover her nakedness, but no\nshoes.She has grievously sinned against the holy mother church, and now\nshe mercifully imposes upon her years of severe penance, that her body\nof sin may be destroyed and her soul saved after suffering one million\nof years in holy purgatory.Our chief duty now, holy mother, in order\nto save this lost soul from mortal sin will be to examine her carefully\nevery, day to ascertain if possible what she most dislikes, or what\nis most revolting to her flesh, that whatever it may be, she, must be\ncompelled to perform it whatever it may cost.Let a holy wax candle burn\nin her cell at night, until further orders.And let the Tuscan heretic\nbe treated in the same way.At\nthe word "Tuscan heretic," possessing the spirit of Christ that I knew\non earth.Yet how true it is that misery loves company; there was even\nsatisfaction in being near my unfortunate friend though our sufferings\nmight be unutterable.Still I was unhappy in the thought that she was\nsuffering on my account.Had I never said a word about borrowing a New\nTestament, she would never have been suspected as being the direct\ncause of my conversion to the truth, and of my renunciation of the vile\nconfessional.I was somewhat puzzled to know what kind of a place was meant by the\nlower regions; I had never heard of these regions before.But soon two\nwomen in black habits with their faces entirely covered excepting\ntwo small holes for the eyes to peep through, came to me and without\nspeaking, made signs for me to follow them.I did so without resistance,\nand soon found myself in an under-ground story of the infernal building."There is your cell," said the cowled inquisitors, "look all around, see\nevery thing, but speak not; no not for your life.The softest whisper\nwill immediately reach the ears of the Mother Abbess, and then you are\nloaded with heavy chains until you die, for there must be no talking\nor whispering in this holy retreat of penance.And," said my jailor\nfurther, "take off your clothes, shoes and stockings, and put on this\nholy coarse garment which will chafe thy flesh but will bless thy soul.Francis saved many souls by this holy garment."As resistance was worse than useless, I complied, and soon found my poor\nfeet aching with the cold on the bare stone floor.I was soon made to\nfeel the blessing of St.My sufferings were\nindescribable.It seemed as though ten thousand bees had stung me in\nevery part.I laid on my\ncoarse straw and groaned and sighed for death to come and relieve me of\nmy anguish.As soon as the holy wax candle was left with me I took it\nin my hand and went forth to survey my dungeon; but I did not enjoy\nmy ramble.In one of the cells, I found my Tuscan friend--that dear\nChristian sister--in great agony, having had on the accursed garment for\nseveral days.Her body was one entire blister, and very much inflamed.Her bones were racked with pain, as with the most excruciating\ninflammatory rheumatism.We recognized each other; she pointed to heaven\nas if to say \'trust in the Lord, my sister, our sufferings will soon\nbe over.\'I kissed my hand to her and returned again to my cell.I\nsaw other victims half dead and emaciated that made my heart sick.I\nrefrained from speaking to any one for I feared my condition, wretched\nas it was, might be rendered even worse, if possible by the fiends who\nhad entire power over me.said I to myself, "why was I born?O give my soul patience to suffer every pain."On the fourth day of my imprisonment the jailor brought me some water\nand soap, a towel, brush and comb, and the same clothes I wore when I\nentered the foul den.They told me to make haste and prepare myself to\nappear before the holy Bishop.Hope revived in my soul, for I always\nthought that my god-father had some regard for me, and had now come to\nrelease me from the foul den I was in.Cold water seemed to afford much\nrelief to my tortured body.I made my toilet as quick as I could in such\na place.My feet were so numb and swollen that it was difficult for me\nto get my shoes on.At last the Bishop arrived as I supposed, and I\nwas conducted--not into his presence as I expected, but into that of\nmy bitterest enemy, the confessor.At the very sight of the monster, I\ntrembled like a reed shaken by the wind.The priest walked to each of\nthe doors, locked them, put the keys into a small writing desk, locked\nit, took out the key and placed it carefully in his sleeve pocket.This\nhe did to assure me that we were alone, that not one of the inmates\ncould by any means disturb for the present the holy meditations of the\npriest.He bade me take a seat on the sofa by him.In kind soft words he\nsaid to me, that if I was only docile and obedient, he would cause me\nto be treated like a princess, and that in a short time I should have\nmy liberty if I preferred to return to the world.At the same time he\nattempted to put his arm around my waist.While he was talking love to me, I was looking at two large alabaster\nvases full of beautiful wax flowers; one of them was as much as I could\nlift.Without one thought about consequences, I seized the nearest vase\nand threw it with all the strength I had at the priest\'s head.He fell\nlike a log and uttered one or two groans.It\nstruck the priest on the right temple, close to the ear.For a moment I\nlistened to see if any one were coming.I then looked at the priest, and\nsaw the blood running out of his wound.I quaked with fear lest I had\nkilled the destroyer of my peace.I did not intend to kill him, I only\nwished to stun him, that I might take the keys, open the door and run,\nfor the back door of the priest\'s room led right into a back path where\nthe gates were frequently opened daring the day time.This was about\ntwelve o\'clock, and a most favorable moment for me to escape.In a\nmoment I had searched the sleeve pocket of the priest, found the key and\na heavy purse of gold which I secured in my dress pocket.I opened the\nlittle writing desk and took out the key to the back door.I saw that\nthe priest was not dead, and I had not the least doubt from appearances,\nbut that he would soon come to.I trembled for fear he might wake before\nI could get away.I thought of my dear Tuscan sister in her wretched\ncell, but I could not get to her without being discovered.I opened the door with the greatest facility and gained\nthe opening into the back path.I locked the door after me, and brought\nthe key with me for a short distance, then placed all the keys tinder\na rock.I had no hat but only a black veil.I threw that over my head\nafter the fashion of Italy and gained the outer gate.There were masons\nat work near the gate which was open and I passed through into the\nstreet without being questioned by any one.As I had not a nun\'s dress on, no one supposed I belonged to the\nInstitution.I could speak a\nfew English words which I had learned from some English friends of my\nfather.Before I got to where the boats lay I saw a gentleman whom I\ntook to be an English or American gentleman.He had a pleasant face,\nlooked at me very kindly, saw my pale dejected face and at once felt a\ndeep sympathy for me.As I appeared to be in trouble and needed help,\nhe extended his hand to me and said in tolerable good Italian, "Como va\'\nle\' signorina?"that is "How do you do young lady?""Me," said he, "Americano, Americano, capitano de\nBastimento.""Signor Capitano," said I,\n"I wish to go on board your ship and see an American ship.""Well," said\nhe, "with a great deal of pleasure; my ship lies at anchor, my men are\nwaiting; you shall dine with me, Signorina."I praised God in my soul for this merciful providence of meeting a\nfriend, though a stranger, whose face seemed to me so honest and so\ntrue.Any condition, even honest slavery, would have been preferred by\nme at that time to a convent.The American ship was the most\nbeautiful thing I ever saw afloat; splendid and neat in all her cabin\narrangements.The mates were polite, and the sailors appeared neat and\nhappy.Even the black cook showed his beautiful white teeth, as though\nhe was glad to see one of the ladies of Italy.Little did\nthey know at that time what peril I was in should I be found out and\ntaken back to my dungeon again.I informed the captain of my situation,\nof having just escaped from a convent into which I had been forced\nagainst my will.I told him I would pay him my passage to America, if\nhe would hide me somewhere until the ship was well out to sea.He said\nI had come just in time, for he was only waiting for a fair wind, and\nhoped to be off that evening."I have," said he, "a large number of\nbread-casks on board, and two are empty.I shall have you put into one\nof these, in which I shall make augur-holes, so that you can have plenty\nof fresh air.Down in the hold amongst the provisions you will be safe."I thanked my kind friend and requested him to buy me some needles, silk,\nand cotton thread, and some stuff for a couple of dresses, and one-piece\nof fine cotton, so that I might make myself comfortable during the\nvoyage.After I ate my dinner, the men called the captain and said there were\nseveral boats full of soldiers coming to the ship, accompanied by the\npriests."Lady," exclaimed the captain, "they are after you.There is\nnot a moment to be lost.Smith, tell\nthe men to be careful and not make known that there is a lady on board."I followed my friend quickly, and soon\nfound myself coiled in a large cask.The captain coopered the head,\nwhich was missing, and made holes for me to get the air; but the\nperspiration ran off my face in a stream.Lots of things were piled on\nthe cask, so that I had hard work to breathe; but such was my fear\nof the priests that I would rather have perished in the cask than be\nreturned to die by inches.The captain had been gone but a short time when I heard steps on deck,\nand much noise and confusion.As the hatches were open, I could hear\nvery distinctly.After the whole company were on deck, the captain\ninvited the priests and friars, about twenty in number, to walk down to\nthe cabin, and explain the cause of their visit.They talked through an\ninterpreter, and said that "a woman of bad character had robbed one of\nthe churches of a large amount of gold, had attempted to murder one\nof the holy priests, but they were happy to say that the holy father,\nthough badly wounded, was in a fair way of recovery.This woman is\nyoung, but very desperate, has awful raving fits, and has recently\nescaped from a lunatic institution.When her fits of madness come on\nthey are obliged to put her into a straight jacket, for she is the most\ndangerous person in Italy.A great reward is offered for her by her\nfather and the government--five thousand scudi.Is not this enough to\ntempt one to help find her?She was seen coming towards the shipping,\nand we want the privilege of searching your ship.""Gentlemen," said the captain, "I do not know that the Italian\nauthorities have any right to search an American ship, under the stars\nand stripes of the United States, for we do not allow even the greatest\nnaval power on earth to do that thing.But if such a mad and dangerous\nwoman as you have described should by any means have smuggled herself\non board my ship, you are quite welcome to take her away as soon as\npossible, for I should be afraid of my life if I was within one hundred\nyards of such an unfortunate creature.If you can get her into your\nlunatic asylum, the quicker the better; and the five thousand scudi will\ncome in good time, for I am thinking of building me a larger ship on my\nreturn home.Now, gentlemen, come; I will assist you, for I should like\nto see the gold in my pocket."The captain opened all his closets and\nsecret places, in the cabin and forecastle and in the hold; everything\nwas searched, all but the identical bread-cask in which I was snugly\ncoiled.After something like half an hour\'s search, the soldiers of King\nFerdinand and the priests of King Pope left the ship, satisfied that the\ncrazy nun was not on board; for, judging the captain by themselves, they\nthought he certainly would have given up a mad woman for the sake of\nfive thousand scudi in gold, and for the safety of his own peace and\ncomfort.A few moments after the Pope\'s friends had left, the excellent\nbenevolent captain came down, and speedily and gently knocking off a\nfew hoops with a hammer, took the head out, and I was free once more\nto breathe God\'s free air.I lifted my trembling heart in thanksgiving,\nwhile tears of gratitude rolled down my cheeks.Yet, as we were still\nwithin the reach of the guns of the papal forts, my heart was by no\nmeans at rest.But the good captain assured me repeatedly that\nall danger was past, for he had twenty-five men on board, all true\nProtestants, and he declared that all the priests of Naples would walk\nover their dead bodies before they should reach his vessel a second\ntime."And besides," said the captain, "there are two American\nmen-of-war in port, who will stand up for the rights of Americans.They\nhave not yet forgotten Captain Ingraham, of the United States ship\nSt.Louis, and his rescue from the Austrian <DW7>s of the Hungarian\npatriot, Martin Kozsta."The captain wisely refused to purchase any\nneedles or thread for me on shore, or any articles of ladies\' dress,\nfor fear of the Jesuitical spies, who might surmise something and cause\nfurther trouble.But he kindly furnished me with some goods he had\npurchased for his own wife, and there were needles and silk enough on\nboard, so that I soon cut and made a few articles that made me very\ncomfortable during our voyage of thirty-two days to London.Early the next morning we sailed out of the beautiful harbor of Naples,\nwith a fair wind.The beautiful ship seemed to fly over the blue sea.I staid on deck gazing at my native city as long as I could.I thought\nthen of my once happy home, of my poor, broken-hearted mother, of my\nunhappy father.Although he had cast me off through the foul play of\nJesuitical intrigue, my love for my dear father remained the same."Farewell, my dear Italy," I said to myself."When, my poor native land,\nwilt thou be happy?Never, never, so long as the Pope lives, and his\nwicked, murderous priests, to curse thee by their power."After we got out into the open sea, the motion of the ship made me feel\nvery sick, and I was so starved out before I came on board, that what\ngood provisions I ate on board did not seem to agree with me.My stomach\nwas in a very bad state, for while I was in the lower regions of the\nconvent I ate only a small quantity of very stale hard bread once in\ntwenty-four hours, at the ringing of the vesper bells every evening, and\nthe water given me was that in which the holy Mother Abbess had washed\nher sacred feet.But I must give the holy mother credit for one good\nomission--she did not use any soap.The captain gave me a good state-room which I occupied with an English\nlady passenger.This good lady was accustomed to the sea, therefore, she\ndid not suffer any inconvenience from sea-sickness; but I was very sick,\nso that I kept my berth for five days.This good Protestant lady was\nvery kind and attentive during the whole passage, and kindly assisted me\nin getting my garments made up on board.On our arrival in London, the\ncaptain said that he would sail for America in two weeks time, and very\nkindly offered me a free passage to his happy, native land; and I could\nnot persuade him to take any money for my passage from Naples, nor for\nthe clothing he had given me.My fellow passenger being wealthy, and well acquainted with people in\nEngland, took me to her splendid home, a few miles from London.At her\nresidence I was introduced to a young French gentleman, a member of the\nEvangelical protestant church in France, and a descendant of the pious\npersecuted Huguenots.This gentleman speaks good English and Italian,\nhaving enjoyed the privilege of a superior education.His fervent\nprayers at the family altar morning and evening made a very deep\nimpression on my mind.He became deeply interested in my history, and\noffered to take me to France, after I should become his lawful wife.Though I did not like the idea of choosing another popish country for my\nresidence, yet as my friend assured me that I should enjoy my protestant\nreligion unmolested, I gave him my hand and my heart.My lady fellow\npassenger was my bridesmaid.We were married by a good protestant\nminister.My husband is a wealthy merchant--gives me means and\nopportunities for doing good.Our\nhome is one of piety and peace and happiness.The blessed Bible is read\nby us every day.Morning and evening we sing God\'s praise, and call upon\nthe name of the Lord.Our prayer is that God may deliver beloved France\nand Italy from the curse of popery.Another proof of the persecuting spirit of Rome is furnished by the\n"Narrative of Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, but who now\n\'comes forth from Inquisitorial search and torture, and tells us what\nhe has seen, heard and felt.\'"We can make but a few extracts from\nthis interesting little volume, published by the American and Foreign\nChristian Union, who,--to use their own language--"send it forth as a\nvoice of instruction and warning to the American people.They are not to be set aside by an apology for the\ndark ages, nor an appeal to the refinement of the nineteenth century.Here is Rome, not as she WAS in the midnight of the world, but as she\nIS at the present moment.There is the same opposition to private\njudgment--the same coercive measures--the same cruel persecution--the\nsame efforts to crush the civil and religious liberties of her own\nsubjects, for which she has ever been characterized."Ciocci, compelled at an early age to enter the Catholic College--forced,\nnotwithstanding his deep disgust and earnest remonstrance, to become a\nmonk--imprisoned--deceived--the victim of priestly artifice and fraud,\nat length becomes a Christian.He is of course thrown into a deeper\ndungeon; and more exquisite anguish inflicted upon him that he may be\nconstrained to return to the Romish faith.Of his imprisonment he says,\n"We traversed long corridors till we arrived at the door of an apartment\nwhich they requested me to enter, and they themselves retired.On\nopening the door I found myself in a close dark room, barely large\nenough for the little furniture it contained, which consisted of a small\nhard bed, hard as the conscience of an inquisitor, a little table cut\nall over, and a dirty ill-used chair.The window which was shut and\nbarred with iron resisted all my efforts to open it My heart sunk within\nme, and I began to cogitate on the destiny in store for me."The Jesuit\nGiuliani entering his room, he asked that the window might be opened\nfor the admission of light and air.Before the words were finished he\nexclaimed in a voice of thunder, "How!wretched youth, thou complainest\nof the dark, whilst thou art living in the clouds of error?Dost thou\ndesire the light of heaven, while thou rejectest the light of the\nCatholic faith?"Ciocci saw that remonstrance was useless, but he reminded his jailer\nthat he had been sent there for three days, to receive instruction, not\nto be treated as a criminal."For three days," he resumed, counterfeiting my tone of voice, "for\nthree days!The dainty youth will not forsooth,\nbe roughly treated; it remains to be seen whether he desires to be\ncourteously entertained.Fortunate is it for thee that thou art come to this place.THOU WILT\nNEVER quit it excepting with the real fruits of repentance!Among these\nsilent shades canst thou meditate at thy leisure upon the deplorable\nstate into which thou hast fallen.Woe unto thee, if thou refusest to\nlisten to the voice of God, who conducts souls into solitude that he\nmay speak with them.""So saying," he continues, "he abruptly left me.I\nremained alone drooping under the weight of a misfortune, which was the\nmore severe, because totally unexpected.I stood, I know not how long,\nin the same position, but on recovering from this lethargy, my first\nidea was of flight.Without giving a minute account of the manner\nin which I passed my wearisome days and nights in this prison, let it\nsuffice to say that they were spent in listening to sermons preached to\nme four times a day by the fathers Giuliani and Rossini, and in the most\ngloomy reflections."In the mean time the miseries I endured were aggravated by the heat of\nthe season, the wretchedness of the chamber, scantiness of food, and the\nrough severity of those by whom I was occasionally visited.Uncertainty\nas to when this imprisonment would be at an end, almost drove me wild,\nand the first words I addressed to those who approached me were, \'Have\nthe kindness to tell me when I shall be permitted to leave this place?\'One replied, \'My son, think of hell.\'I interrogated another; the answer\nwas, \'Think my son, how terrible is the death of the sinner!\'I spoke\nto a third, to a fourth, and one said to me, \'My son, what will be your\nfeeling, if, on the day of judgment you find yourself on the left hand\nof God?\'the other, \'Paradise, my son, Paradise!\'No one gave me a\ndirect answer; their object appeared to be to mistify and confound me.After the first few days, I began to feel most severely the want of\na change of clothing.Accustomed to cleanliness, I found myself\nconstrained to wear soiled apparel.* * * For the want of a comb, my\nhair became rough and entangled.After the fourth day my portion of food\nwas diminished; a sign, that they were pressing the siege, that it was\ntheir intention to adopt both assault and blockade--to conquer me by\narms, or induce me to capitulate through hunger.I had been shut up in\nthis wretched place for thirteen days, when, one day, about noon, the\nFather Mislei, the author of all my misery, entered my cell."At the sight of this man, resentment overcame every other\nconsideration, and I advanced towards him fully prepared to indulge my\nfeelings, when he, with his usual smile, expressed in bland words\nhis deep regret at having been the cause of my long detention in this\nretreat.\'Never could I have supposed,\' said he, \'that my anxiety\nfor the salvation of your soul would have brought you into so much\ntribulation.But rest assured the fault is not entirely mine.You have\nyourself, in a great degree, by your useless obstinacy, been the cause\nof your sufferings.Ah, well, we will yet remedy all.\'Not feeling any\nconfidence in his assurance, I burst out into bitter invectives and\nfierce words.He then renewed his protestations, and clothed them with\nsuch a semblance of honesty and truth, that when he ended with this\ntender conclusion, \'Be assured, my son, that I love you,\' my anger\nvanished.* * * I lost sight of the Jesuit, and thought I was addressing\na man, a being capable of sympathising in the distresses of others.\'Ah,\nwell, father,\' said I, \'I need some one on whom I can rely, some one\ntowards whom I can feel kindly; I will therefore place confidence in\nyour words.\'"After some further conversation, Ciocci was asked if\nhe wished to leave that place.he replied, "what a\nstrange question!You might as well ask a condemned soul whether he\ndesires to escape from hell!"At these words the Jesuit started like a\ngoaded animal, and, forgetting his mission of deceiver, with, knit brows\nand compressed lips, he allowed his ferocious soul for one moment\nto appear; but, having grown old in deceit, he immediately had the\ncircumspection to give this movement of rage the appearance of religious\nzeal, and exclaimed, "What comparisons are these?Are you not ashamed to\nassume the language of the Atheist?By speaking in this way you clearly\nmanifest how little you deserve to leave this place.But since I have\ntold you that I love you, I will give you a proof of it by thinking no\nmore of those irreligious expressions; they shall be forgotten as though\nthey had never been spoken.Well, the Cardinal proposes to you an easy\nway of returning to your monastery.""Here is\nthe way," said he, presenting me with a paper: "copy this with your\nown hand; nothing more will be required of you.""I took the paper with\nconvulsive eagerness.It was a recantation of my faith, there condemned\nas erroneous.* * * Upon reading this, I shuddered, and, starting to my\nfeet, in a solemn attitude and with a firm voice, exclaimed, \'Kill me,\nif you please; my life is in your power; but never will I subscribe\nto that iniquitous formulary.\'The Jesuit, after laboring in vain\nto persuade me to his wishes, went away in anger.I now momentarily\nexpected to be conducted to the torture.Whenever I was taken from my\nroom to the chapel, I feared lest some trap-door should open beneath\nmy feet, and therefore took great care to tread in the footsteps of the\nJesuit who preceded me.No one acquainted with the Inquisition will say\nthat my precaution was needless.My imagination was so filled with the\nhorrors of this place, that even in my short, interrupted, and feverish\ndreams I beheld daggers and axes glittering around me; I heard the noise\nof wheels, saw burning piles and heated irons, and woke in convulsive\nterror, only to give myself up to gloomy reflections, inspired by the\nreality of my situation, and the impressions left by these nocturnal\nvisions.What tears did I shed in those dreary moments!How innumerable\nwere the bitter wounds that lacerated my heart!My prayers seemed to me\nunworthy to be received by a God of charity, because, notwithstanding\nall my efforts to banish from my soul every feeling of resentment\ntowards my persecutors, hatred returned with redoubled power.I often\nrepeated the words of Christ, \'Father, forgive them, they know not what\nthey do;\' but immediately a voice would answer, \'This prayer is not\nintended for the Jesuits; they resemble not the crucifiers, who were\nblind instruments of the rage of the Jews; while these men are fully\nconscious of what they are doing; they are the modern Pharisees.\'The\nreading of the Bible would have afforded me great consolation, but this\nwas denied me."* * *\n\nThe fourteenth day of his imprisonment he was taken to the council\nto hear his sentence, when he was again urged to sign the form of\nrecantation.The Father Rossini then spoke: "You are\ndecided; let it be, then, as you deserve.Rebellious son of the church,\nin the fullness of the power which she has received from Christ, you\nshall feel the holy rigor of her laws.She cannot permit tares to grow\nwith the good seed.She cannot suffer you to remain among her sons and\nbecome the stumbling-block for the ruin of many.Abandon, therefore,\nall hope of leaving this place, and of returning to dwell among the\nfaithful.KNOW, ALL IS FINISHED FOR YOU!"For the conclusion of this narrative we refer the reader to the volume\nitself.If any more evidence were needed to show that the spirit of Romanism is\nthe same to-day that it has ever been, we find it in the account of\na legal prosecution against ten Christians at Beldac, in France,\nfor holding and attending a public worship not licensed by the civil\nauthority.They had made repeated, respectful, and earnest applications\nto the prefect of the department of Hante-Vienne for the authorization\nrequired by law, and which, in their case, ought to have been given.They persisted in rendering to God that worship\nwhich his own command and their consciences required.For this they were\narraigned as above stated, on the 10th of August, 1855.On the 26th of\nJanuary, 1856, the case was decided by the "tribunal," and the three\npastors and one lady, a schoolmistress, were condemned to pay a fine\nof one thousand francs each, and some of the others five-hundred francs\neach, the whole amount, together with legal expenditures, exceeding the\nsum of nine thousand francs.Meantime, the converts continue to hold their worship-meetings in the\nwoods, barns, and secret places, in order not to be surprised by the\npolice commissioner, and to avoid new official reports."Thus, you see," says V. De Pressense, in a letter to the \'American and\nforeign Christian Union,\' "that we are brought back to the religious\nmeetings of the desert, when the Protestants of the Cevennes evinced\nsuch persevering fidelity.The only difference is, that these Christians\nbelonged only a short time ago to that church which is now instigating\npersecutions against them."DESTRUCTION OF THE INQUISITION IN SPAIN.Lehmanowsky was attached to the part of Napoleon\'s army\nwhich was stationed in Madrid.L., "I\nused to speak freely among the people what I thought of the Priests\nand Jesuits, and of the Inquisition.It had been decreed by the Emperor\nNapoleon that the Inquisition and the Monasteries should be suppressed,\nbut the decree, he said, like some of the laws enacted in this country,\nwas not executed."Months had passed away, and the prisons of the Inquisition had not been\nopened.One night, about ten or eleven o\'clock, as he was walking one of\nthe streets of Madrid, two armed men sprang upon him from an alley, and\nmade a furious attack.He instantly drew his sword, put himself in a\nposture of defence, and while struggling with them, he saw at a distance\nthe lights of the patrols,--French soldiers mounted, who carried\nlanterns, and who rode through the streets of the city at all hours of\nthe night, to preserve order.He called to them in French, and as they\nhastened to his assistance, the assailants took to their heels and\nescaped; not, however, before he saw by their dress that they belonged\nto the guards of the Inquisition.He went immediately to Marshal Soult, then Governor of Madrid, told him\nwhat had taken place, and reminded him of the decree to suppress this\ninstitution.Marshal Soult told him that he might go and suppress it The\nColonel said that his regiment (the 9th.of the Polish Lancers,) was not\nsufficient for such a service, but if he would give him two additional\nregiments, the 117th, and another which he named, he would undertake the\nwork.The 117th regiment was under the command of Col.De Lile, who\nis now, like Col.L., a minister of the gospel, and pastor of an\nevangelical church in Marseilles, France."The troops required were\ngranted, and I proceeded," said Col.L., "to the Inquisition which was\nsituated about five miles from the city.It was surrounded by a wall of\ngreat strength, and defended by a company of soldiers.When we arrived\nat the walls, I addressed one of the sentinels, and summoned the holy\nfathers to surrender to the Imperial army, and open the gates of the\nInquisition.The sentinel who was standing on the wall, appeared to\nenter into conversation with some one within, at the close of which he\npresented his musket, and shot one of my men.This was the signal of\nattack, and I ordered my troops to fire upon those who appeared on the\nwalls."It was soon obvious that it was an unequal warfare.The soldiers of the\nholy office were partially protected by a breast-work upon the walls\nwhich were covered with soldiers, while our troops were in the open\nplain, and exposed to a destructive fire.We had no cannon, nor could\nwe scale the walls, and the gates successfully resisted all attempts at\nforcing them.I could not retire and send for cannon to break through\nthe walls without giving them time to lay a train for blowing us up.I saw that it was necessary to change the mode of attack, and directed\nsome trees to be cut down and trimmed, to be used as battering rams.Two\nof these were taken up by detachments of men, as numerous as could work\nto advantage, and brought to bear upon the walls with all the power they\ncould exert, while the troops kept up a fire to protect them from the\nfire poured upon them from the walls.Presently the walls began to\ntremble, a breach was made, and the Imperial troops rushed into the\nInquisition.Here we met with an incident, which nothing but Jesuitical\neffrontery is equal to.The Inquisitor General, followed by the father\nconfessors in their priestly robes, all came out of their rooms, as we\nwere making our way into the interior of the Inquisition, and with long\nfaces, and arms crossed over their breasts, their fingers resting on\ntheir shoulders, as though they had been deaf to all the noise of\nthe attack and defence, and had just learned what was going on, they\naddressed themselves in the language of rebuke to their own soldiers,\nsaying, "WHY DO YOU FIGHT OUR FRIENDS, THE FRENCH?"Their intention, no doubt, was to make us think that this defence was\nwholly unauthorized by them, hoping, if they could make us believe\nthat they were friendly, they should have a better opportunity, in the\nconfusion of the moment, to escape.Their artifice was too shallow, and\ndid not succeed.I caused them to be placed under guard, and all\nthe soldiers of the Inquisition to be secured as prisoners.We then\nproceeded to examine all the rooms of the stately edifice.We passed\nthrough room after room; found all perfectly in order, richly furnished,\nwith altars and crucifixes, and wax candles in abundance, but we could\ndiscover no evidences of iniquity being practiced there, nothing of\nthose peculiar features which we expected to find in an Inquisition.We found splendid paintings, and a rich and extensive library.Here was\nbeauty and splendor, and the most perfect order on which my eyes\nhad ever rested.The\nceilings and floors of wood were scoured and highly polished.The marble\nfloors were arranged with a strict regard to order.There was everything\nto please the eye and gratify a cultivated taste; but where were those\nhorrid instruments of torture, of which we had been told, and where\nthose dungeons in which human beings were said to be buried alive?The holy father assured us that they had been\nbelied; that we had seen all; and I was prepared to give up the search,\nconvinced that this Inquisition was different from others of which I had\nheard.De Idle was not so ready as myself to give up the search, and\nsaid to me, "Colonel, you are commander to-day, and as you say, so it\nmust be; but if you will be advised by me, let this marble floor be\nexamined.Let water be brought and poured upon it, and we will watch\nand see if there is any place through which it passes more freely than\nothers."I replied to him, "Do as you please, Colonel," and ordered\nwater to be brought accordingly.The slabs of marble were large and\nbeautifully polished.When the water had been poured over the floor,\nmuch to the dissatisfaction of the inquisitors, a careful examination\nwas made of every seam in the floor, to see if the water passed through.De Lile exclaimed that he had found it.By the side of\none of these marble slabs the water passed through fast, as though\nthere was an opening beneath.All hands were now at work for further\ndiscovery; the officers with their swords and the soldiers with their\nbayonets, seeking to clear out the seam, and pry up the slab; others\nwith the butts of their muskets striking the slab with all their might\nto break it, while the priests remonstrated against our desecrating\ntheir holy and beautiful house.While thus engaged, a soldier, who was\nstriking with the butt of his musket, struck a spring, and the marble\nslab flew up.Then the faces of the inquisitors grew pale as Belshazzar\nwhen the hand writing appeared on the wall; they trembled all over;\nbeneath the marble slab, now partly up, there was a stair-case.I\nstepped to the altar, and took from the candlestick one of the candles\nfour feet in length, which was burning that I might explore the room\nbelow.As I was doing this, I was arrested by one of the inquisitors,\nwho laid his hand gently on my arm, and with a very demure and holy look\nsaid "My son, you must not take those lights with your bloody hands they\nare holy.""Well," said I, "I will take a holy thing to shed light\non iniquity; I will bear the responsibility."I took the candle, and\nproceeded down the stair-case.As we reached the foot of the stairs\nwe entered a large room which was called the hall of judgment.In the\ncentre of it was a large block, and a chain fastened to it.On this they\nwere accustomed to place the accused, chained to his seat.On one side\nof the room was an elevated seat called the Throne of Judgment.This,\nthe Inquisitor General occupied, and on either side were seats less\nelevated, for the holy fathers when engaged in the solemn business of\nthe Holy Inquisition.From this room we proceeded to the right, and obtained access to small\ncells extending the entire length of the edifice; and here such sights\nwere presented as we hoped never to see again.Three cells were places\nof solitary confinement, where the wretched objects of inquisitorial\nhate were confined year after year, till death released them from their\nsufferings, and their bodies were suffered to remain until they were\nentirely decayed, and the rooms had become fit for others to occupy.To prevent this being offensive to those who occupied the Inquisition,\nthere were flues or tubes extending to the open air, sufficiently\ncapacious to carry off the odor.In these cells we found the remains\nof some who had paid the debt of nature: some of them had been dead\napparently but a short time, while of others nothing remained but their\nbones, still chained to the floor of their dungeon.In others we found living sufferers of both sexes and of every age, from\nthree score years and ten down to fourteen or fifteen years--all naked\nas they were born into the world!Here were old men\nand aged women, who had been shut up for many years.Here, too, were the\nmiddle aged, and the young man and the maiden of fourteen years old.The soldiers immediately went to work to release the captives from\ntheir chains, and took from their knapsacks their overcoats and\nother clothing, which they gave to cover their nakedness.They were\nexceedingly anxious to bring them out to the light of day; but Col.L., aware of the danger, had food given them, and then brought them\ngradually to the light, as they were able to bear it.L., to explore another room on the left.Here we found the instruments of torture, of every kind which the\ningenuity of men or devils could invent.L., here described four\nof these horrid instruments.The first was a machine by which the victim\nwas confined, and then, beginning with the fingers, every joint in the\nhands, arms and body, were broken or drawn one after another, until the\nvictim died.The second was a box, in which the head and neck of the\nvictim were so closely confined by a screw that he could not move in any\nway.Over the box was a vessel, from which one drop of water a second,\nfell upon the head of the victim;--every successive drop falling upon\nprecisely the same place on the head, suspended the circulation in a few\nmoments, and put the sufferer in the most excruciating agony.The third\nwas an infernal machine, laid horizontally, to which the victim was\nbound; the machine then being placed between two beams, in which were\nscores of knives so fixed that, by turning the machine with a crank, the\nflesh of the sufferer was torn from his limbs, all in small pieces.The\nfourth surpassed the others in fiendish ingenuity.Its exterior was\na beautiful woman, or large doll, richly dressed, with arms extended,\nready, to embrace its victim.Around her feet a semi-circle was drawn.The victim who passed over this fatal mark, touched a spring which\ncaused the diabolical engine to open; its arms clasped him, and a\nthousand knives cut him into as many pieces in the deadly embrace.L., said that the sight of these engines of infernal cruelty kindled the\nrage of the soldiers to fury.They declared that every inquisitor and\nsoldier of the inquisition should be put to the torture.They might have turned their\narms against him if he had attempted to arrest their work.The first they put to death in the machine for\nbreaking joints.The torture of the inquisitor put to death by the\ndropping of water on his head was most excruciating.The poor man cried\nout in agony to be taken from the fatal machine.The inquisitor general\nwas brought before the infernal engine called "The Virgin.""No" said they, "you have caused others to kiss her, and\nnow you must do it."They interlocked their bayonets so as to form large\nforks, and with these pushed him over the deadly circle.The beautiful\nimage instantly prepared for the embrace, clasped him in its arms,\nand he was cut into innumerable pieces.L. said, he witnessed the\ntorture of four of them--his heart sickened at the awful scene--and he\nleft the soldiers to wreak their vengeance on the last guilty inmate of\nthat prison-house of hell.In the mean time it was reported through Madrid that the prisons of the\nInquisition were broken open, and multitudes hastened to the fatal spot.And, Oh, what a meeting was there!About a\nhundred who had been buried for many years were now restored to life.There were fathers who had found their long lost daughters; wives were\nrestored to their husbands, sisters to their brothers, parents to their\nchildren; and there were some who could recognize no friend among the\nmultitude.The scene was such as no tongue can describe.L. caused the library, paintings,\nfurniture, etc., to be removed, and having sent to the city for a wagon\nload of powder, he deposited a large quantity in the vaults beneath\nthe building, and placed a slow match in connection with it.All had\nwithdrawn to a distance, and in a few moments there was a most joyful\nsight to thousands.The walls and turrets of the massive structure rose\nmajestically towards the heavens, impelled by the tremendous explosion,\nand fell back to the earth an immense heap of ruins.Lehmanowsky of the destruction of the\ninquisition in Spain.Was it then finally destroyed, never again to be\nrevived?Giacinto Achilli, D. D.\nSurely, his statements in this respect can be relied upon, for he is\nhimself a convert from Romanism, and was formerly the "Head Professor of\nTheology, and Vicar of the Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace."He certainly had every opportunity to obtain correct information on the\nsubject, and in a book published by him in 1851, entitled "Dealings\nwith the Inquisition," we find, (page 71) the following startling\nannouncement."We are now in the middle of the nineteenth century, and\nstill the Inquisition is actually and potentially in existence.This\ndisgrace to humanity, whose entire history is a mass of atrocious\ncrimes, committed by the priests of the Church of Rome, in the name of\nGod and of His Christ, whose vicar and representative, the pope, the\nhead of the Inquisition, declares himself to be,--this abominable\ninstitution is still in existence in Rome and in the Roman States."Again, (page 89) he says, "And this most infamous Inquisition, a hundred\ntimes destroyed and as often renewed, still exists in Rome as in the\nbarbarous ages; the only difference being that the same iniquities are\nat present practiced there with a little more secrecy and caution than\nformerly, and this for the sake of prudence, that the Holy See may not\nbe subjected to the animadversions of the world at large."On page 82 of the same work we find the following language."I do not\npropose to myself to speak of the Inquisition of times past, but of what\nexists in Rome at the present moment; I shall therefore assert that the\nlaws of this institution being in no respect changed, neither can the\ninstitution itself be said to have undergone any alteration.The present\nrace of priests who are now in power are too much afraid of the popular\nindignation to let loose all their inquisitorial fury, which might even\noccasion a revolt if they were not to restrain it; the whole world,\nmoreover, would cry out against them, a crusade would be raised against\nthe Inquisition, and, for a little temporary gratification, much power\nwould be endangered.This is the true reason why the severity of its\npenalties is in some degree relaxed at the present time, but they still\nremain unaltered in its code."Again on page 102, he says, "Are the torments which are employed at the\npresent day at the Inquisition all a fiction?It requires the impudence\nof an inquisitor, or of the Archbishop of Westminister to deny their\nexistence.I have myself heard these evil-minded persons lament and\ncomplain that their victims were treated with too much lenity.I inquired of the inquisitor of Spoleto.Thomas Aquinas says," answered he; "DEATH TO ALL THE\nHERETICS.""Hand over, then, to one of these people, a person, however respectable;\ngive him up to one of the inquisitors, (he who quoted St.Thomas Aquinas\nto me was made an Archbishop)--give up, I say, the present Archbishop of\nCanterbury, an amiable and pious man, to one of these rabid inquisitors;\nhe must either deny his faith or be burned alive.Is not this the spirit that invariably actuates the\ninquisitors?and not the inquisitors only, but all those who in any\nway defile themselves with the inquisition, such as bishops and their\nvicars, and all those who defend it, as the <DW7>s do.Wiseman, the Archbishop of Westminster according to the\npope\'s creation, the same who has had the assurance to censure me from\nhis pulpit, and to publish an infamous article in the Dublin Review, in\nwhich he has raked together, as on a dunghill, every species of filth\nfrom the sons of Ignatius Loyola; and there is no lie or calumny that he\nhas not made use of against me.Well, then, suppose I were to be handed\nover to the tender mercy of Dr.Wiseman, and he had the full power to\ndispose of me as he chose, without fear of losing his character in\nthe eyes of the nation to which, by parentage more than by merit, he\nbelongs, what do you imagine he would do with me?Should I not have to\nundergo some death more terrible than ordinary?Would not a council be\nheld with the reverend fathers of the company of Loyola, the same who\nhave suggested the abominable calumnies above alluded to, in order\nto invent some refined method of putting me out of the world?I feel\npersuaded that if I were condemned by the Inquisition to be burned\nalive, my calumniator would have great pleasure in building my funeral\npile, and setting fire to it with his own hands; or should strangulation\nbe preferred, that he would, with equal readiness, arrange the cord\naround my neck; and all for the honor and glory of the Inquisition, of\nwhich, according to his oath, he is a true and faithful servant."Achilli is the spirit of Romanism!Can we\ndoubt that it would lead to results as frightful as anything described\nin the foregoing story?But let us listen to his further remarks on the present state of the\nInquisition.On page 75 he says, "What, then, is the Inquisition of the\nnineteenth century?The same system of intolerance which prevailed in\nthe barbarous ages.That which raised the Crusade and roused all Europe\nto arms at the voice of a monk [Footnote: Bernard of Chiaravalle.]and\nof a hermit, [Footnote: Peter the Hermit.]That which--in the name of\na God of peace, manifested on earth by Christ, who, through love\nfor sinners, gave himself to be crucified--brought slaughter on the\nAlbigenses and the Waldenses; filled France with desolation, under\nDomenico di Guzman; raised in Spain the funeral pile and the scaffold,\ndevastating the fair kingdoms of Granada and Castile, through the\nassistance of those detestable monks, Raimond de Pennefort, Peter\nArbues, and Cardinal Forquemorda.That, which, to its eternal infamy,\nregisters in the annals of France the fatal 24th of August, and the 5th\nof November in those of England."That same system which at this moment flourishes at Rome, which has\nnever yet been either worn out or modified, and which at this present\ntime, in the jargon of the priests, is called a "the holy, Roman,\nuniversal, apostolic Inquisition.Holy, as the place where Christ was\ncrucified is holy; apostolic, because Judas Iscariot was the first\ninquisitor; Roman and universal, because FROM ROME IT EXTENDS OVER ALL\nTHE WORLD.It is denied by some that the Inquisition which exists in\nRome as its centre, is extended throughout the world by means of the\nmissionaries.The Roman Inquisition and the Roman Propaganda are in\nclose connection with each other.Every bishop who is sent in partibus\ninfidelium, is an inquisitor charged to discover, through the means of\nhis missionaries, whatever is said or done by others in reference to\nRome, with the obligation to make his report secretly.The Apostolic\nnuncios are all inquisitors, as are also the Apostolic vicars.Here,\nthen, we see the Roman Inquisition extending to the most remote\ncountries."Again this same writer informs us, (page 112,) that "the\nprincipal object of the Inquisition is to possess themselves, by\nevery means in their power, of the secrets of every class of society.Consequently its agents (Jesuits and Missionaries,) enter the domestic\ncircle, observe every motion, listen to every conversation, and would,\nif possible, become acquainted with the most hidden thoughts.It is in\nfact, the police, not only of Rome, but of all Italy; INDEED, IT MAY BE\nSAID OF THE WHOLE WORLD."Achilli are fully corroborated by the Rev.In a book published by him in 1852, entitled\n"The Brand of Dominic," we find the following remarks in relation to the\nInquisition of the present time.The Roman Inquisition is, therefore,\nacknowledged to have an infinite multitude of affairs constantly on\nhand, which necessitates its assemblage thrice every week.Still there\nare criminals, and criminal processes.The body of officials are still\nmaintained on established revenues of the holy office.So far from any\nmitigation of severity or judicial improvement in the spirit of its\nadministration, the criminal has now no choice of an advocate; but one\nperson, and he a servant of the Inquisition, performs an idle ceremony,\nunder the name of advocacy, for the conviction of all.And let the\nreader mark, that as there are bishops in partibus, so, in like manner,\nthere are inquisitors of the same class appointed in every country, and\nchiefly, in Great Britain and the colonies, who are sworn to secrecy,\nand of course communicate intelligence to this sacred congregation of\nall that can be conceived capable of comprehension within the infinitude\nof its affairs.We must, therefore, either believe that the court\nof Rome is not in earnest, and that this apparatus of universal\njurisdiction is but a shadow,--an assumption which is contrary to all\nexperience,--or we must understand that the spies and familiars of the\nInquisition are listening at our doors, and intruding themselves on our\nhearths.How they proceed, and what their brethren at Rome are doing,\nevents may tell; BUT WE MAY BE SURE THEY ARE NOT IDLE.They were not idle in Rome in 1825, when they rebuilt the prisons of\nthe Inquisition.They were not idle in 1842, when they imprisoned Dr.Achilli for heresy, as he assures us; nor was the captain, or some other\nof the subalterns, who, acting in their name, took his watch from him\nas he came out.They were not idle in 1843, when they renewed the old\nedicts against the Jews.And all the world knows that the inquisitors on\ntheir stations throughout the pontifical states, and the inquisitorial\nagents in Italy, Germany, and Eastern Europe, were never more active\nthan during the last four years, and even at this moment, when every\npolitical misdemeanor that is deemed offensive to the Pope, is,\nconstructively, a sin against the Inquisition, and visited with\npunishment accordingly.A deliberative body, holding formal session\nthrice every week, cannot be idle, and although it may please them to\ndeny that Dr.Achilli saw and examined a black book, containing the\npraxis now in use, the criminal code of inquisitors in force at this\nday,--as Archibald Bower had an abstract of such a book given him for\nhis use about one hundred and thirty years ago,--they cannot convince\nme that I have not seen and handled, and used in the preparation of this\nvolume, the compendium of an unpublished Roman code of inquisitorial\nregulations, given to the vicars of the inquisitor-general of Modena.They may be pleased to say that the mordacchia, or gag, of which Dr.Achilli speaks, as mentioned in that BLACK BOOK, is no longer used;\nbut that it is mentioned there, and might be used again is more than\ncredible to myself, after having seen that the "sacred congregation" has\nfixed a rate of fees for the ordering, witnessing, and administration of\nTORTURE.There was indeed, a talk of abolishing torture at Rome; but\nwe have reason to believe that the congregation will not drop the\nmordacchia, inasmuch, as, instead of notifying any such reformation to\nthe courts of Europe, this congregation has kept silence.For although a\ncontinuation of the bullary has just been published at Rome, containing\nseveral decrees of this congregation, there is not one that announces\na fulfilment of this illusory promise,--a promise imagined by a\ncorrespondent to French newspapers, but never given by the inquisitors\nthemselves.And as there is no proof that they have yet abstained from\ntorture, there is a large amount of circumstantial evidence that they\nhave delighted themselves in death.When public burnings\nbecame inexpedient--as at Goa--did they not make provision for private\nexecutions?For a third time at least the Roman prisons--I am not speaking of those\nof the provinces--were broken open, in 1849, after the desertion of Pius\nIX., and two prisoners were found there, an aged bishop and a nun.Many persons in Rome reported the event; but instead of copying what is\nalready before the public, I translate a letter addressed to me by P.\nAlessandro Gavazzi, late chaplain-general of the Roman army, in reply\nto a few questions which I had put to him.All who have heard his\nstatements may judge whether his account of facts be not marked with\nevery note of accuracy.They will believe that his power of oratory DOES\nNOT betray him into random declamation.Under date of March 20th, 1852,\nhe writes thus:\n\n"MY DEAR SIR,--In answering your questions concerning the palace of\nInquisition at Rome, I should say that I can give only a few superficial\nand imperfect notes.So short was the time that it remained open to the\npublic, So great the crowd of persons that pressed to catch a sight of\nit, and so intense the horror inspired by that accursed place, that I\ncould not obtain a more exact and particular impression."I found no instruments of torture, [Footnote: "The gag, the\nthumb-screw, and many other instruments of severe torture could be\neasily destroyed and others as easily procured.The non-appearance of\ninstruments is not enough to sustain the current belief that the use of\nthem is discontinued.So long as there is a secret prison, and while\nall the existing standards of inquisitorial practice make torture\nan ordinary expedient for extorting information, not even a bull,\nprohibiting torture, would be sufficient to convince the world that\nit has been discontinued.The practice of falsehood is enjoined on\ninquisitors.How, then, could we believe a bull, or decree, if it were\nput forth to-morrow, to release them from suspicion, or to screen them\nfrom obloquy?It would not be entitled to belief."--Rev.for they were destroyed at the time of the first French invasion,\nand because such instruments were not used afterwards by the modern\nInquisition.I did, however, find, in one of the prisons of the second\ncourt, a furnace, and the remains of a woman\'s dress.I shall never be\nable to believe that that furnace was placed there for the use of the\nliving, it not being in such a place, or of such a kind, as to be of\nservice to them.Everything, on the contrary, combines to persuade me\nthat it was made use of for horrible deaths, and to consume the remains\nof the victims of inquisitorial executions.Another object of horror I\nfound between the great hall of judgment and the luxurious apartment of\nthe chief jailer (primo custode), the Dominican friar who presides over\nthis diabolical establishment.This was a deep trap or shaft opening\ninto the vaults under the Inquisition.As soon as the so-called criminal\nhad confessed his offence; the second keeper, who is always a Dominican\nfriar, sent him to the father commissary to receive a relaxation\n[Footnote: "In Spain, RELAXATION is delivery to death.In the\nestablished style of the Inquisition it has the same meaning.But in the\ncommon language of Rome it means RELEASE.In the lips of the inquisitor,\ntherefore, if he used the word, it has one meaning, and another to the\near of the prisoner."--Rev.With the\nhope of pardon, the confessed culprit would go towards the apartment of\nthe holy inquisitor; but in the act of setting foot at its entrance,\nthe trap opened, and the world of the living heard no more of him.I\nexamined some of the earth found in the pit below this trap; it was a\ncompost of common earth, rottenness, ashes, and human hair, fetid to the\nsmell, and horrible to the sight and to the thought of the beholder."But where popular fury reached its highest pitch was in the vaults of\nSt.Pius V. I am anxious that you should note well that this pope was\ncanonized by the Roman church especially for his zeal against heretics.I will now describe to you the manner how, and the place where, those\nvicars of Jesus Christ handled the living members of Jesus Christ, and\nshow you how they proceeded for their healing.You descend into the\nvaults by very narrow stairs.A narrow corridor leads you to the\nseveral cells, which, for smallness and stench, are a hundred times more\nhorrible than the dens of lions and tigers in the Colosseum.Wandering\nin this labyrinth of most fearful prisons, that may be called \'graves\nfor the living,\' I came to a cell full of skeletons without skulls,\nburied in lime, and the skulls, detached from the bodies, had been\ncollected in a hamper by the first visitors.and why were they buried in that place and in that manner?I have heard\nsome popish priests trying to defend the Inquisition from the charge of\nhaving condemned its victims to a secret death, say that the palace of\nthe Inquisition was built on a burial-ground, belonging anciently to a\nhospital for pilgrims, and that the skeletons found were none other\nthan those of pilgrims who had died in that hospital.But everything\ncontradicts this papistical defence.Suppose that there had been a\ncemetery there, it could not have had subterranean galleries and\ncells, laid out with so great regularity; and even if there had been\nsuch--against all probability--the remains of bodies would have been\nremoved on laying the foundation of the palace, to leave the space free\nfor the subterranean part of the Inquisition.Besides, it is contrary to\nthe use of common tombs to bury the dead by carrying them through a door\nat the side; for the mouth of the sepulchre is always at the top.And\nagain, it has never been the custom in Italy to bury the dead singly in\nquick lime; but, in time of plague, the dead bodies have been usually\nlaid in a grave until it was sufficiently full, and then quick lime has\nbeen laid over them, to prevent pestilential exhalations, by hastening\nthe decomposition of the infected corpses.This custom was continued,\nsome years ago, in the cemeteries of Naples, and especially in the daily\nburial of the poor.Therefore, the skeletons found in the Inquisition\nof Rome could not belong to persons who had died a natural death in\na hospital; nor could any one, under such a supposition, explain the\nmystery of all the bodies being buried in lime except the head.It\nremains, then, beyond a doubt, that that subterranean vault contained\nthe victims of one of the many secret martyrdoms of the butcherly\ntribunal.The following is the most probable opinion, if it be not\nrather the history of a fact:\n\n"The condemned were immersed in a bath of slaked lime, gradually filled\nup to their necks.The lime by little and little enclosed the sufferers,\nor walled them up alive.As the lime\nrose higher and higher, the respiration became more and more painful,\nbecause more difficult.So that what with the suffocation of the smoke,\nand the anguish of the compressed breathing, they died in a manner most\nhorrible and desperate.Some time after their death the heads would\nnaturally separate from the bodies, and roll away into the hollows made\nby the shrinking of the lime.Any other explanation of the feet that may\nbe attempted will be found improbable and unnatural.You may make what\nuse you please of these notes of mine, since I can warrant their\ntruth.I wish that writers, speaking of this infamous tribunal of the\nInquisition, would derive their information from pure history, unmingled\nwith romance; for so great and so many the historical atrocities of the\nInquisition, that they would more than suffice to arouse the detestation\nof a thousand worlds.I know that the popish impostor-priests go about\nsaying that the Inquisition was never an ecclesiastical tribunal, but\na laic.But you will have shown the contrary in your work, and may also\nadd, in order quite to unmask these lying preachers, that the palace\nof the Inquisition at Rome is under the shadow of the palace of the\nVatican; that the keepers are to this day, Dominican friars; and that\nthe prefect of the Inquisition at Rome is the Pope in person."I have the honor to be your affectionate Servant,\n\n"ALESSANDRA GAVAZZI.""The Roman parliament decreed the erection of a pillar opposite the\npalace of the Inquisition, to perpetuate the memory of the destruction\nof that nest of abominations; but before that or any other monument\ncould be raised, the French army besieged and took the city, restored\nthe Pope, and with him the tribunal of the faith.Achilli thrown into one of its old prisons, on the 29th of July 1849,\nbut the violence of the people having made the building less adequate\nto the purpose of safe keeping, he was transferred to the castle of\nSt.Angelo, which had often been employed for the custody of similar\ndelinquents, and there he lay in close confinement until the 9th of\nJanuary, 1850, when the French authorities, yielding to influential\nrepresentations from this country assisted him to escape in disguise as\na soldier, thus removing an occasion of scandal, but carefully leaving\nthe authority of the congregation of cardinals undisputed.Indeed\nthey first obtained the verbal sanction of the commissary, who saw it\nexpedient to let his victim go, and hush an outcry."Yet some have the hardihood to affirm that there is no longer any\nInquisition; and as the Inquisitors were instructed to suppress the\ntruth, to deny their knowledge of cases actually passing through their\nhands, and to fabricate falsehoods for the sake of preserving the\nSECRET, because the secret was absolutely necessary to the preservation\nof their office, so do the Inquisitors in partibus falsify and illude\nwithout the least scruple of conscience, in order to put the people of\nthis country off their guard."That the Inquisition really exists, is placed beyond a doubt by its\ndaily action as a visible institution at Rome.But if any one should\nfancy that it was abolished after the release of Dr.Achilli, let him\nhear a sentence contradictory, from a bull of the Pope himself, Pius IX,\na document that was dated at Rome, August 22, 1851, where the pontiff,\ncondemning the works of Professor Nuytz, of Turin, says, "after having\ntaken the advice of the doctors in theology and canon law, AFTER HAVING\nCOLLECTED THE SUFFRAGES OF OUR VENERABLE BROTHERS THE CARDINALS OF THE\nCONGREGATION OF THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL INQUISITION."And so recently\nas March, 1852, by letters of the Secretariate of State, he appointed\nfour cardinals to be "members of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy\nRoman and Universal Inquisition;" giving incontrovertible evidence that\nprovision is made for attending to communications of Inquisitors in\npartibus from all parts of the world.As the old cardinals die off,\ntheir vacant seats are filled by others.The \'immortal legion\' is\npunctually recruited."After all, have we in Great Britain, Ireland and the colonies, and our\nbrethren of the foreign mission stations, any reason to apprehend harm\nto, ourselves from the Inquisition as it is?In reply to this question,\nlet it be observed;\n\n"1.That there are Inquisitors in partibus is not to be denied.That\nletters of these Inquisitors are laid before the Roman Inquisition is\nequally certain.Even in the time of Leo XII, when the church of\nRome was far less active in the British empire than it is now, some\nparticular case was always decided on Thursday, when the Pope, in his\ncharacter of universal Inquisitor, presided in the congregation.It\ncannot be thought that now, in the height of its exultation, daring and\naggression, this congregation has fewer emissaries, or that they are\nless active, or less communicative than they were at that time.We\nalso see that the number is constantly replenished.The cardinals Della\nGenga-Sermattei; De Azevedo; Fornari; and Lucciardi have just been added\nto it.Besides a cardinal in England, and a delegate in Ireland, there is\nboth in England and Ireland, a body of bishops, \'natural Inquisitors,\'\nas they are always acknowledged, and have often claimed to be; and these\nnatural Inquisitors are all sworn to keep the secret--the soul of the\nInquisition.Since, then, there are Inquisitors in partibus, appointed\nto supply the lack of an avowed and stationary Inquisition, and since\nthe bishops are the very persons whom the court of Rome can best\ncommand, as pledged for such a service, it is reasonable to suppose they\nact in that capacity.Some of the proceedings of these bishops confirm the assurance that\nthere is now an Inquisition in activity in England.* * * The vigilance\nexercised over families, also the intermeddling of priests with\neducation, both in families and schools, and with the innumerable\nrelations of civil society, can only be traced back to the Inquisitors\nin partibus, whose peculiar duty, whether by help of confessors or\nfamiliars, is to worm out every secret of affairs, private or public,\nand to organize and conduct measures of repression or of punishment.Where the secular arm cannot be borrowed, and where offenders lie beyond\nthe reach of excommunication, irregular methods must be resorted to,\nnot rejecting any as too crafty or too violent.Discontented mobs, or\nindividual zealots are to be found or bought.What part the Inquisitors\nin partibus play in Irish assassinations, or in the general mass of\nmurderous assaults that is perpetrated in the lower haunts of crime,\nit is impossible to say.Under cover of confessional and Inquisitorial\nsecrets, spreads a broad field of action--a region of mystery--only\nvisible to the eye of God, and to those\'most reverend and most eminent\'\nguardians of the papacy, who sit thrice every week, in the Minerva\nand Vatican, and there manage the hidden springs of Inquisition on the\nheretics, schismatics, and rebels, no less than on \'the faithful\'\nof realms.Who can calculate the extent of their power over those\n\'religious houses,\' where so many of the inmates are but neophytes,\nunfitted by British education for the intellectual and moral abnegation,\nthe surrender of mind and conscience, which monastic discipline\nexacts?Yet they must be coerced into submission, and kept under penal\ndiscipline.Who can tell how many of their own clergy are withdrawn\nto Rome, and there delated, imprisoned, and left to perish, if not\n\'relaxed\' to death, in punishment of heretical opinions or liberal\npractices?We have heard of laymen, too, taken to Rome by force, or\ndecoyed thither under false pretences there to be punished by the\nuniversal Inquisition; and whatever of incredibility may appear in some\ntales of Inquisitorial abduction, the general fact that such abductions\nhave taken place, seems to be incontrovertible.And now that the\nInquisitors in partibus are distributed over Christendom, and that they\nprovide the Roman Inquisition with daily work from year\'s end to year\'s\nend, is among the things most certain,--even the most careless of\nEnglishmen must acknowledge that we have all reason to apprehend much\nevil from the Inquisition as it is.And no Christian can be aware of\nthis fact, without feeling himself more than ever bound to uphold\nthe cause of christianity, both at home and abroad, as the only\ncounteractive of so dire a curse, and the only remedy of so vast an\nevil."E. A. Lawrence, writing of "Romanism at Rome," gives us the\nfollowing vivid description of the present state of the Roman Church."Next is seen at Rome the PROPAGANDA, the great missionary heart of the\nwhole masterly system.Noiselessly, by the multiform orders of monks and\nnuns, as through so many veins and arteries, it sends out and receives\nback its vital fluid.In its halls, the whole world is distinctly\nmapped out, and the chief points of influence minutely marked.A kind of\ntelegraphic communication is established with the remotest stations in\nSouth Africa and Siberia, and with almost every nook in our own land,\nto which the myrmidons of Papal power look with the most of fear.It\nis through means of this moral galvanic battery, set up in the Vatican,\nthat the Church of Rome has gained its power of UBIQUITY--has so well\nnigh made itself OMNIPOTENT, as well as omnipresent."It is no mean or puny antagonist that strides across the path of a\nfree, spiritual and advancing Protestantism.And yet, with a simple\nshepherd\'s sling, and the smooth stones gathered from Siloa\'s brook, God\nwill give it the victory."Once more let us look, and we shall find at Rome, still working in its\ndark, malignant efficiency, the INQUISITION.Men are still made to pass\nthrough fires of this Moloch.This is the grand defensive expedient of\nthe Papacy, and is the chief tribunal of the States.Its processes are\nall as secret as the grave.Its cells are full of dead men\'s bones.They\ncall it the Asylum for the poor--a retreat for doubting and distressed\npilgrims, where they may have experience of the parental kindness of\ntheir father the Pope, and their mother the church.Achilli had a trial of this beneficient discipline, when thrown\ninto the deep dungeon of St.And how many other poor victims of\nthis diabolical institution are at this moment pining in agony, heaven\nknows."In America, we talk about Rome as having ceased to persecute.She holds to the principle as tenaciously as ever.Of the evil spirit of Protestantism she says, "This\nkind goeth not out, but by fire."Hence she must hold both the principle and the power of persecution, of\ncompelling men to believe, or, if they doubt, of putting them to death\nfor their own good.Take from her this power and she bites the dust."It may perchance be said that the remarks of the Rev.William Rule,\nquoted above, refer exclusively to the existing state of things is\nEngland, Ireland, and the colonies.But who will dare to say, after a\ncareful investigation of the subject, that they do not apply with equal\nforce to these United States?Has America nothing to fear from the inquisitors--from the Jesuits?Is\nit true that the "Inquisition still exists in Rome--that its code is\nunchanged--that its emissaries are sent over all the world--that every\nnuncio and bishop is an Inquisitor," and is it improbable that, even\nnow, torture rooms like those described in the foregoing story, may be\nfound in Roman Catholic establishments in this country?Yes, even here,\nin Protestant, enlightened America!Have WE then nothing to fear from\nRomanism?But a few days since a gentleman of learning and intelligence\nwhen speaking of this subject, exclaimed, "What have we to do with the\nJesuits?The idea that we have aught\nto fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow\nme to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the\nMadeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and\nnot only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many\nof the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished\nthe Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to\nwhom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in\nthis great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard\nfor their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through\nthe advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected\nthe Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic\noperations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who\ndistinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible\nreligion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for\npopish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their\nsect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the\nchurch.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was\nrewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop\'s mitre, for his great,\nzeal and success, in removing God\'s Holy Bible from thirty-eight public\nschools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to\nexamine every book in the hands of American children in the public\nschools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history\nunpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing\nto do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in\nthe United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is\nto us?"M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows."The\nAmerican people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A\nRELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the\nfallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,\nbecause they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man\nof sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.The tree is known\nby its fruit, such as \'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;\' and where\nthe spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving\nto God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does\nthe tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,\nand respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he\nfled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United\nStates, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He\nsays, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied\nin business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the\nmiseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in\nthis free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been\nduped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female\nconvents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a\nfriend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who\nis always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the\nBishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of\nredress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and\nsuffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may\nhave a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew\none-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to\nsee her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor\nattached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the\nmost unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend\nthe confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand\ncross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their\nminds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature\nof the priest\'s, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any\nfriends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her\nfate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the\ndear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up\nto heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly\nrelative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives\nwith a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,\ntheir disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her\nfriends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How\namazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of\nreligion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO\n\nIn a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find\nthe following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary\nin Chile, South America."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most\nworthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the\ncountry, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,\nin Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The\nadmittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a\nbride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,\nbeside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most\nsolemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh\nand spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter\nmansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off\nher rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and\nbrilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to\nfifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are\nsubmitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the\nworld, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in\nwhich she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre\nwalls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are\nshut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,\nif ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends\nor The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or\ndevoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If\never allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot\nbe seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint\nescapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the\nsound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to\npour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of\nher heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer\nits own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant\nrelief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her\ntomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator\nof all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient\nand unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are\nnot allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, \'Que morir\ntenemos, \'we are to die,\' or \'we must die,\' and to reply, \'Ya los\nsabemos,\' \'we know it,\' or \'already we know it\'\n\n"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in\na narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without\nbed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their\ndaily dress is their only covering.\'Tired\nnature\'s sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions\nlights on his unsullied with a tear:\' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR\nthey are aroused by the bell to perform their \'Ave Maria\'s,\' count their\nrosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they\ndrag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its\nlast account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within\nthe walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed\nsister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative\nof facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by\nalmost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of \'perfecting the\nsaints,\' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass\nand adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in\nlockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the\nignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO\nSELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, \'without money\nand without price?\'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female\nto incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in\npieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of\nthis city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of\ncourse, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this\nperfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to\ncut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich\ndiamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,\ndiabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in\nall lands.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the\n\'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,\' especially that part of it relating to these\nsecret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,\n"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence\nhere and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not\nshow the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in\ncountries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of\nour government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,\nwhich holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But\nthey constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with\nthe interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable\ncircumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have\ninflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few\nProtestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of\nno crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut\nup in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate\nwhen entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,\nvery few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our\npeople have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus\nmanifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension\nof the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in\nthe construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are\nrevealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection\nwith things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be\nlost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in\nlegislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same\ntalented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants\nshould lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in\nrespect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to\ncall to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences\nfrom the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the\ninheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their\nchildren free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they\nreceived it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that\nwhat she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here\nwhen fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving\nabout everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and\nconvents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have\nserved as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show\nthat she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of\nProtestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults\nare made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions\nand interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly\nclamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and\npolitical creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and\nto renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and\nchildren\'s children, should lose no time in informing themselves of\nthe state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its\ninstitutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and\ninfluence to the protection of the country against those Popish\nestablishments and their usages which have been set up among us without\nthe authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the\nnations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now\nbut little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which\nMexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of\nrecovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in\nthe mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in\nthe neighborhood under the names of\'schools,\'\'retreats\',\'religions\ncommunities,\' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or\nare not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are\nsituated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and\nforwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be\nsubjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which\nall Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible\ninstitutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist\nupon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the\nwords of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon\ndelivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its\nanniversary in May, 1856."But new it is asked, \'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?\'It is not against the unhappy millions that are\nground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of\nthe common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like\nourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,\nthe man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would\ngrant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.We can have\nno animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the\ncoming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and\nlive, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to\noppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue\ncleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible\npower on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,\nsir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for\nwe would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has\ninspired.\'A tirade against Romanism,\' is it?O sir, we remember\nthe persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish\nInquisition; we remember the reign of \'the Bloody Mary;\' we remember\nthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;\nwe remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we\nremember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along\nthe ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the\nislanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these\nshores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to\npropagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further\nvigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade\nand all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of\nthat great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never\nbe hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of\nFarel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the\ntrumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three\nhundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children\nof the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal\nweapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of\ntruth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST\nFALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the\ncoming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS\nANTICHRIST MUST FALL."When Flint was fully satisfied that all danger from pursuit was over,\nhe set out for the purpose of going to the city in order to perfect\nthe arrangements for carrying out the project he had in view.On passing out, the first object that met his view was his faithful\nfollower Black Bill, siting at the entrance."Follered de Ingins what was a comin\' arter massa," replied the boy.Bill had followed his master into the wilderness, always like a body\nservant keeping near his person when not prevented by the Indians,\nwhich was the case while his master was a prisoner.When the escape of Flint was discovered, he was free from restraint,\nand he, unknown to the party who had gone in pursuit, had followed\nthem.From the <DW64>, Flint learned that the Indians had tracked him to the\ncave, but not finding him there, and not being able to trace him any\nfurther, they had given up the pursuit.Flint thinking that the boy might be of service to him in the business\nhe was about to enter upon, took him into the cave and put him in\ncharge of Lightfoot.On reaching the city, Flint purchased the schooner of which he was in\ncommand when first introduced to the reader.It is said that, "birds of a feather flock together," and Flint having\nno difficulty gathering about him a number of kindred spirits, was\nsoon in a condition to enter upon the profession as he called it, most\ncongenial to his taste and habits.When the crew of the schooner woke up on the morning following the\nnight in which we have described in a previous chapter, they were by\nno means the reckless, dare-devil looking men they were when they\nentered the cave on the previous evening.For besides the usual effects produced on such characters by a night\'s\ndebauch, their countenances wore the haggard suspicious look of men\nwho felt judgment was hanging over them; that they were in the hands\nof some mysterious power beyond their control.Some power from which\nthey could not escape, and which sooner or later, would mete out to\nthem the punishment they felt that they deserved.They had all had troubled dreams, and several of them declared that\nthey had heard that terrible groan during the night repeated if\npossible, in a more horrible manner than before.To others the ghosts of the men they had lately murdered, appeared\nmenacing them with fearful retribution.As the day advanced, and they had to some extent recovered their\nspirits by the aid of their favorite stimulants, they attempted to\nlaugh the matter off as a mere bugbear created by an imagination over\nheated by too great an indulgence in strong drink.Although this opinion was not shared by Captain Flint, who had\ncarefully abstained from over-indulgence, for reasons of his own, he\nencouraged it in his men.But even they, while considering it necessary to remain quiet for a\nfew days, to see whether or not, any harm should result to them, in\nconsequence of their late attack on the merchant ship, none of them\nshowed a disposition to pass another night in the cave.Captain Flint made no objection to his men remaining outside on the\nfollowing night, as it would give him the opportunity to investigate\nthe matter, which he desired.On the next night, when there was no one in the cavern but himself and\nthe two who usually occupied it, he called Lightfoot to him, and asked\nher if she had ever heard any strange noises in the place before."Sometime heard de voices of the Indian braves dat gone to the spirit\nland," said the woman."Did you ever hear anything like the groan we heard last night?""Tink him de voice ob the great bad spirit," was the reply.Captain Flint, finding that he was not likely to learn anything in\nthis quarter that would unravel the mystery, now called the <DW64>."Bill," he said, "did you ever hear that noise before?""When you trow my--"\n\n"Hold your tongue, you black scoundrel, or I\'ll break every bone in\nyour body!"roared his master, cutting off the boy\'s sentence in the\nmiddle.The boy was going to say:\n\n"When you trow\'d my fadder into the sea."The captain now examined every portion of the cavern, to see if he\ncould discover anything that could account for the production of the\nstrange sound.In every part he tried his voice, to see if he could produce those\nremarkable echoes, which had so startled him, on the previous night,\nbut without success.The walls, in various parts of the cavern, gave back echoes, but\nnothing like those of the previous night.There were two recesses in opposite sides of the cave.The larger one\nof these was occupied by Lightfoot as a sleeping apartment.The other,\nwhich was much smaller, Black Bill made use of for the same purpose.From these two recesses, the captain had everything removed, in order\nthat he might subject them to a careful examination.He tried his voice here, as in other parts of the cavern, but the\nwalls gave back no unusual echoes.He was completely baffled, and, placing his lamp on the table, he sat\ndown on one of the seats, to meditate on what course next to pursue.Lightfoot and Bill soon after, at his request, retired.He had been seated, he could not tell how long, with his head resting\non his hands, when he was aroused by a yell more fearful, if possible,\neven than the groan that had so alarmed him on the previous night.The yell was repeated in the same horrible and mysterious manner that\nthe groan had been.Flint sprang to his feet while the echoes were still ringing in his\nears, and rushed to the sleeping apartment, first, to that of the\nIndian woman, and then, to that of the <DW64>.They both seemed to be sound asleep, to all appearance, utterly\nunconscious of the fearful racket that was going on around them.Captain Flint, more perplexed and bewildered than ever, resumed his\nseat by the table; but not to sleep again that night, though the\nfearful yell was not repeated.The captain prided himself on being perfectly free from all\nsuperstition.He held in contempt the stories of ghosts of murdered men coming back\nto torment their murderers.In fact, he was very much inclined to disbelieve in any hereafter at\nall, taking it to be only an invention of cunning priests, for the\npurpose of extorting money out of their silly dupes.But here was\nsomething, which, if not explained away, would go far to stagger his\ndisbelief.He was glad that the last exhibition had only been witnessed by\nhimself, and that the men for the present preferred passing their\nnights outside; for, as he learned from Lightfoot, the noises were\nonly during the night time.This would enable him to continue his investigation without any\ninterference on the part of the crew, whom he wished to keep in utter\nignorance of what he was doing, until he had perfectly unraveled the\nmystery.For this purpose, he gave Lightfoot and Black Bill strict charges not\nto inform the men of what had taken place during the night.He was determined to pass the principal portion of the day in sleep,\nso as to be wide awake when the time should come for him to resume his\ninvestigations.On the day after the first scene in the cave, late in the afternoon,\nthree men sat on the deck of the schooner, as she lay in the shadow of\nforest covered mountain.These were Jones Bradley, Old Ropes, and the man who went by the name\nof the Parson.They were discussing the occurrences of the previous\nnight."I\'m very much of the captains opinion," said the Parson, "that the\nnoises are caused by the wind rushing through the chinks and crevices\nof the rocks.""Yes; but, then, there wan\'t no wind to speak of, and how is the wind\nto make that horrible groan, s\'pose it did blow a hurricane?""Just so," said Old Ropes; "that notion about the wind makin\' such a\nnoise at that, is all bosh.My opinion is, that it was the voice of a\nspirit.I know that the captain laughs at all such things, but all his\nlaughin\' don\'t amount to much with one that\'s seen spirits."you don\'t mean to say that you ever actually see a live ghost?""That\'s jist what I do mean to say," replied Old Ropes."Hadn\'t you been takin\' a leetle too much, or wasn\'t the liquor too\nstrong?""Well, you may make as much fun about it as you please," said Old\nRopes; "but I tell you, that was the voice of a spirit, and, what\'s\nmore, I believe it\'s either the spirit of some one that\'s been\nmurdered in that cave, by some gang that\'s held it before, and buried\nthe body over the treasure they\'ve stowed away there, or else the\nghost of some one\'s that\'s had foul play from the captain.""Well," said the Parson, "if I thought there was any treasure there\nworth lookin\' after, all the ghosts you could scare up wouldn\'t hinder\nme from trying to get at it.""But, no matter about that; you say you see a live ghost once."I suppose," said Old Ropes, "that there aint no satisfaction in a\nfeller\'s tellin\' of things that aint no credit to him; but,\nhowsomever, I might as well tell this, as, after all, it\'s only in the\nline of our business."You must know, then, that some five years ago, I shipped on board a\nbrig engaged in the same business that our craft is."I needn\'t tell you of all the battles we were in, and all the prizes\nwe made; but the richest prize that ever come in our way, was a\nSpanish vessel coming from Mexico, With a large amount of gold and\nsilver on board."We attacked the ship, expecting to make an easy prize of her, but we\nwere disappointed."The Spaniards showed fight, and gave us a tarnal sight of trouble."This made our captain terrible wrothy.He swore that every soul that\nremained alive on the captured vessel should be put to death."Now, it so happened that the wife and child (an infant,) of the\ncaptain of the Spanish vessel, were on board.When the others had all\nbeen disposed of, the men plead for the lives of these two.But our\ncaptain would not listen to it; but he would let us cast lots to see\nwhich of us would perform the unpleasant office."As bad luck would have it, the lot fell upon me."It must be done; so, the plank was got ready.She took the baby in\nher arms, stepped upon the plank, as I ordered her, and the next\nmoment, she, with the child in her arms, sank to rise no more; but the\nlook she gave me, as she went down, I shall never forget."It haunts me yet, and many and many is the time that Spanish woman,\nwith the child in her arms, has appeared to me, fixing upon me the\nsame look that she gave me, as she sank in the sea."Luck left us from that time; we never took a prize afterwards."Our Vessel was captured by a Spanish cruiser soon afterwards.I, with\none other, succeeded in making our escape."The captain, and all the rest, who were not killed in the battle,\nwere strung out on the yard-arm.""I suppose that\'s because she\'s a Spaniard, and thinks you don\'t\nunderstand her language," remarked the Parson, sneeringly."I wonder\nwhy this ghost of the cave don\'t show himself, and not try to frighten\nus with his horrible boo-wooing.""Well, you may make as much fun as you please," replied Old Ropes;\n"but, mark my words for it, if the captain don\'t pay attention to the\nwarning he has had, that ghost will show himself in a way that won\'t\nbe agreeable to any of us.""If he takes my advice, he\'ll leave the cave, and take up his quarters\nsomewhere else."you don\'t mean to say you\'re afraid!""Put an enemy before me in the shape of flesh and blood, and I\'ll show\nyou whether I\'m afeard, or not," said Old Ropes; "but this fighting\nwith dead men\'s another affair.Lead and\nsteel wont reach \'em, and the very sight on \'em takes the pluck out of\na man, whether he will or no."An enemy of real flesh and blood, when he does kill you, stabs you or\nshoots you down at once, and there\'s an end of it; but, these ghosts\nhave a way of killing you by inches, without giving a fellow a chance\nto pay them back anything in return.""It\'s pretty clear, anway, that they\'re a \'tarnal set of cowards,"\nremarked the Parson."The biggest coward\'s the bravest men, when there\'s no danger,"\nretorted Old Ropes.To this, the Parson made no reply, thinking, probably, that he had\ncarried the joke far enough, and not wishing to provoke a quarrel with\nhis companion."As to the affair of the cave," said Jones Bradley; "I think very much\nas Old Ropes does about it.I\'m opposed to troubling the dead, and I\nbelieve there\'s them buried there that don\'t want to be disturbed by\nus, and if we don\'t mind the warning they give us, still the worse for\nus.""The captain don\'t seem to be very much alarmed about it," said the\nParson; "for he stays in the cave.And, then, there\'s the Indian woman\nand the darkey; the ghost don\'t seem to trouble them much.""I\'ll say this for Captain Flint," remarked Old Ropes, "if ever I\nknowed a man that feared neither man nor devil, that man is Captain\nFlint; but his time\'ll come yet.""You don\'t mean to say you see breakers ahead, do you?""Not in the way of our business, I don\'t mean," said Ropes; "but, I\'ve\nhad a pretty long experience in this profession, and have seen the\nfinishing up of a good many of my shipmates; and I never know\'d one\nthat had long experience, that would not tell you that he had been put\nmore in fear by the dead than ever he had by the living.""We all seem to be put in low spirits by this afternoon," said the\nParson; "s\'pose we go below, and take a little something to cheer us\nup."To this the others assented, and all three went below.All Captain Flint\'s efforts to unravel the mysteries of the cave were\nunsuccessful; and he was reluctantly obliged to give up the attempt,\nat least for the present; but, in order to quiet the minds of the\ncrew, he told them that he had discovered the cause, and that it was\njust what he had supposed it to be.As everything remained quiet in the cave for a long time after this,\nand the minds of the men were occupied with more important matters,\nthe excitement caused by it wore off; and, in a while, the affair\nseemed to be almost forgotten.And here we may as well go back a little in our narrative, and restore\nthe chain where it was broken off a few chapters back.When Captain Flint had purchased the schooner which he commanded, it\nwas with the professed object of using her as a vessel to trade with\nthe Indians up the rivers, and along the shore, and with the various\nseaports upon the coast.To this trade it is true, he did to some extent apply himself, but\nonly so far as it might serve as a cloak to his secret and more\ndishonorable and dishonest practices.Had Flint been disposed to confine himself to the calling he pretended\nto follow, he might have made a handsome fortune in a short time, but\nthat would not have suited the corrupt and desperate character of the\nman.He was like one of those wild animals which having once tasted blood,\nhave ever afterward an insatiable craving for it.It soon became known to a few of the merchants in the city, among the\nrest Carl Rosenthrall, that Captain Flint had added to his regular\nbusiness, that of smuggling.This knowledge, however, being confined to those who shared the\nprofits with him, was not likely to be used to his disadvantage.After a while the whole country was put into a state of alarm by the\nreport that a desperate pirate had appeared on the coast.Several vessels which had been expected to arrive with rich cargoes\nhad not made their appearance, although the time for their arrival had\nlong passed.There was every reason to fear that they had been\ncaptured by this desperate stranger who had sunk them, killing all on\nboard.The captain of some vessels which had arrived in safety reported\nhaving been followed by a suspicious looking craft.They said she was a schooner about the size of one commanded by\nCaptain Flint, but rather longer, having higher masts and carrying\nmore sail.No one appeared to be more excited on the subject of the pirate, than\nCaptain Flint.He declared that he had seen the mysterious vessel, had\nbeen chased by her, and had only escaped by his superior sailing.Several vessels had been fitted out expressly for the purpose of\ncapturing this daring stranger, but all to no purpose; nothing could\nbe seen of her.For a long time she would seem to absent herself from the coast, and\nvessels would come and go in safety.Then all of a sudden, she would\nappear again and several vessels would be missing, and never heard\nfrom more.The last occurrence of this kind is the one which we have already\ngiven an account of the capturing and sinking of the vessel in which\nyoung Billings had taken passage for Europe.We have already seen how Hellena Rosenthrall\'s having accidentally\ndiscovered her lover\'s ring on the finger of Captain Flint, had\nexcited suspicions of the merchant\'s daughter, and what happened to\nher in consequence.Captain Flint having made it the interest of Rosenthrall to keep his\nsuspicions to himself if he still adhered to them, endeavored to\nconvince him that his daughter was mistaken, and that the ring however\nmuch it might resemble the one belonging to her lover, was one which\nhad been given to him by his own mother at her death, and had been\nworn by her as long as he could remember.This explanation satisfied, or seemed to satisfy the merchant, and the\ntwo men appeared to be as good friends as ever again.The sudden and strange disappearance of the daughter of a person of so\nmuch consequence as Carl Rosenthrall, would cause no little excitement\nin a place no larger than New York was at the time of which we write.Most of the people agreed in the opinion with the merchant that the\ngirl had been carried off by the Indian Fire Cloud, in order to avenge\nhimself for the insult he had received years before.As we have seen,\nCaptain Flint encouraged this opinion, and promised that in an\nexpedition he was about fitting out for the Indian country, he would\nmake the recovery of the young woman one of his special objects.Flint knew all the while where Fire Cloud was to be found, and fearing\nthat he might come to the city ignorant as he was of the suspicion he\nwas laboring under, and thereby expose the double game he was playing,\nhe determined to visit the Indian in secret, under pretence of putting\nhim on his guard, but in reality for the purpose of saving himself.He sought out the old chief accordingly, and warned him of his danger.Fire Cloud was greatly enraged to think that he should be suspected\ncarrying off the young woman."He hated her father," he said, "for he was a cheat, and had a crooked\ntongue.But the paleface maiden was his friend, and for her sake he\nwould find her if she was among his people, and would restore her to\nher friends.""If you enter the city of the palefaces, they will hang you up like a\ndog without listening to anything you have to say in your defence,"\nsaid Flint."The next time Fire Cloud enters the city of the palefaces, the maiden\nshall accompany him," replied the Indian.This was the sort of an answer that Flint wished, and expected, and he\nnow saw that there was no danger to be apprehended from that quarter.But if Captain Flint felt himself relieved from danger in this\nquarter, things looked rather squally in another.If he knew how to\ndisguise his vessel by putting on a false bow so as to make her look\nlonger, and lengthen the masts so as to make her carry more sail, he\nwas not the only one who understood these tricks.And one old sailor\nwhose bark had been chased by the strange schooner, declared that she\nvery much resembled Captain Flint\'s schooner disguised in this way.And then it was observed that the strange craft was never seen when\nthe captain\'s vessel was lying in port, or when she was known to be up\nthe river where he was trading among the Indians.Another suspicious circumstance was, that shortly after the strange\ndisappearance of a merchant vessel, Flint\'s schooner came into port\nwith her rigging considerably damaged, as if she had suffered from\nsome unusual cause.Flint accounted for it by saying that he had been\nfired into by the pirate, and had just escaped with the skin of his\nteeth.These suspicions were at first spoken cautiously, and in whispers\nonly, by a very few.They came to the ears of Flint himself at last, who seeing the danger\nimmediately set about taking measures to counteract it by meeting and\nrepelling, what he pretended to consider base slanders invented by his\nenemies for the purpose of effecting his ruin.He threatened to prosecute the slanderers, and if they wished to see\nhow much of a pirate he was, let them fit out a vessel such as he\nwould describe, arm her, and man her according to his directions, give\nhim command of her, and if he didn\'t bring that blasted pirate into\nport he\'d never return to it himself.He\'d like no better fun than to\nmeet her on equal terms, in an open sea.This bragadocia had the desired effect for awhile; besides, although\nit could hardly be said that Flint had any real friends, yet there\nwere so many influential men who were concerned with him in some of\nhis contraband transactions.These dreaded the exposure to themselves,\nshould Flint\'s real character be discovered, which caused them to\nanswer for him in the place of friends.These men would no doubt be the first to crush him, could they only do\nso without involving themselves in his ruin.But all this helped to convince Flint that his time in this part of\nthe country was pretty near up, and if he meant to continue in his\npresent line of business, he must look out for some new field of\noperations.More than ever satisfied on this point, Captain Flint anxiously\nawaited the arrival of the vessel, the capture of which was to be the\nfinishing stroke of his operations in this part of the world.When Captain Flint had decided to take possession of the cavern, and\nfit it up as a place of retreat and concealment for himself and his\ngang, he saw the necessity of having some one whom he could trust to\ntake charge of the place in his absence.A moment\'s reflection\nsatisfied him there was no one who would be more likely to serve him\nin this capacity than the Indian woman who had rescued him from the\nfearful fate he had just escaped.Lightfoot, who in her simplicity, looked upon him as a great chief,\nwas flattered by the proposal which he made her, and immediately took\ncharge of the establishment, and Captain Flint soon found that he had\nno reason to repent the choice he had made, so far as fidelity to his\ninterests was concerned.For a while at first he treated her with as much kindness as it was in\nthe nature of such as he to treat any one.He may possibly have felt some gratitude for the service she had\nrendered him, but it was self-interest more than any other feeling\nthat caused him to do all in his power to gain a controling influence\nover her.He loaded her with presents of a character suited to her uncultivated\ntaste.Her person fairly glittered with beads, and jewelry of the most gaudy\ncharacter, while of shawls and blankets of the most glaring colors,\nshe had more than she knew what to do with.This course he pursued until he fancied he had completely won her\naffection, and he could safely show himself in his true character\nwithout the risk of loosing his influence over her.His manner to her now changed, and he commenced treating her more as a\nslave than an equal, or one to whom he felt himself under obligations.It is true he would now and then treat her as formerly, and would\noccasionally make her rich presents, but it would be done in the way\nthat the master would bestow a favor on a servant.Lightfoot bore this unkind treatment for some time without resenting\nit, or appearing to notice it.Thinking perhaps that it was only a\nfreak of ill-humor that would last but for a short time, and then the\ngreat chiefs attachment would return.Flint fancied that he had won the heart of the Indian woman, and\nacting on the presumption that "love is blind," he thought that he\ncould do as he pleased without loosing hold on her affections.He had only captured the woman\'s\nfancy.So that when Lightfoot found this altered manner of the captain\'s\ntowards her was not caused by a mere freak of humor, but was only his\ntrue character showing itself, her fondness for him, if fondness it\ncould be called, began to cool.Things had come to this pass, when Hellena Rosenthrall was brought\ninto the cave.The first thought of Lightfoot was that she had now discovered the\ncause of the captain\'s change of manner towards her.He had found\nanother object on which to lavish his favors and here was her rival.And she was to be the servant, the slave of this new favorite.Flint, in leaving Hellena in charge of Lightfoot, gave strict charges\nthat she should be treated with every attention, but that she should\nby no means be allowed to leave the cave.The manner of Lightfoot to Hellena, was at first sullen: and reserved,\nand although she paid her all the attention that Hellena required of\nher, she went no further.But after awhile, noticing the sad countenance of her paleface sister,\nand that her face was frequently bathed in tears, her heart softened\ntoward her, and she ventured to ask the cause of her sorrow.And when\nshe had heard Hellena\'s story, her feelings towards her underwent an\nentire change.From this time forward the two women were firm friends, and Lightfoot\npledged herself to do all in her power to restore her to her friends.Her attachment to Captain Flint was still too strong, however, to make\nher take any measures to effect that object, until she could do so\nwithout endangering his safety.But Lightfoot was not the only friend that Hellena had secured since\nher capture.She had made another, and if possible a firmer one, in\nthe person of Black Bill.From the moment Hellena entered the cavern, Bill seemed to be\nperfectly fascinated by her.Had she been an angel just from heaven,\nhis admiration for her could hardly have been greater.He could not\nkeep his eyes off of her.He followed her as she moved about, though\ngenerally at a respectful distance, and nothing delighted him so much,\nas to be allowed to wait upon her and perform for her such little acts\nof kindness as lay within his power.While Hellena was relating the story of her wrongs to Lightfoot, Black\nBill sat at a little distance off an attentive listener to the\nnarrative.When it was finished, and Hellena\'s eyes were filled with\ntears, the darkey sprang up saying in an encouraging tone of voice:\n\n"Don\'t cry, don\'t cry misses, de debble\'s comin arter massa Flint\nberry soon, he tell me so hisself; den Black Bill take care ob de\nwhite angel."This sudden and earnest outburst of feeling and kindness from the\n<DW64>, expressed as it was in such a strange manner, brought a smile\nto the face of the maiden, notwithstanding the affliction which was\ncrushing her to the earth."Why Bill," said Hellena, "you don\'t mean to say you ever saw the\ndevil here, do you?""Never seed him, but heer\'d him doe, sometimes," replied Bill.Now, Hellena, although a sensible girl in her way, was by no means\nfree from the superstition of the times.She believed in ghosts, and\nwitches, and fairies, and all that, and it was with a look of\nconsiderable alarm that she turned to the Indian woman, saying:\n\n"I hope there ain\'t any evil spirits in this cave, Lightfoot.""No spirits here dat will hurt White Rose (the name she had given to\nHellena) or Lightfoot," said the Indian woman."The spirits of the great Indian braves who have gone to the land of\nspirits come back here sometimes.""Neber see dem, but hear dem sometime," replied Lightfoot.said Lightfoot, "are they not my friends?"Lightfoot perceiving that Hellena\'s curiosity, as well as her fears\nwere excited; now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,\ncommenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to\nthe cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:\n\nShe said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had\nput foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land\nfor a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a\ngreat nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in\nthe bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough\nto contend with them was sure to be brought into subjection, if not\nutterly destroyed.Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for\nbravery.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted\nas much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land\nwas overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was\nbecause they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to\nthem in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal\nchiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit\nwould speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,\nevery thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said\nhe would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him\nthat they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if\nhe persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and\ntold them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great\nSpirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose\nof frightening him.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a\ngreat brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to\nhim, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country\nof all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his\nown, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.And then\nhe laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into\nthe magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to\nsay.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came\nout sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,\nand his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation\nscattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.And he collected another great army, and went to war again.But by\nthis time the other nations, seeing the danger they were in, united\nagainst him as a common enemy.He was overthrown, killed, and his army entirely cut to pieces.The conquering army now entered this country, and laid it waste, as\ntheirs had been laid waste before.And the war was carried on for many years, until the prophesy was\nfulfilled that had been spoken by the Great Spirit, and the people of\nthis once mighty nation were scattered to the four winds.This people as a great nation are known no longer, but a remnant still\nremains scattered among the other tribes.Occasionally some of them\nvisit this cave, to whom alone its mysteries are known, or were,\nLightfoot said, until she had brought Captain Flint there in order to\nescape their pursuers."Is the voice of the Great Spirit ever heard here now?"Lightfoot said the voice of the Great Spirit had never been heard\nthere since the destruction of his favorite nation, but that the\nspirits of the braves as he had said before, did sometimes come back\nfrom the spirit-land to speak comfort to the small remnant of the\nfriends who still remained upon the earth.This narrative of the Indian woman somewhat satisfied the curiosity of\nHellena, but it did not quiet her fears, and to be imprisoned in a\ndreary cavern haunted by spirits, for aught she knew, demons, was to\nher imagination, about as terrible a situation as she could possibly\nbe placed in.CHAPTER X.\n\n\nWhen there were none of the pirates in the cave, it was the custom of\nLightfoot, and Hellena to spread their couch in the body of the\ncavern, and there pass the night.Such was the case on the night\nfollowing the day on which Lightfoot had related to Hellena the sad\nhistory of her people.It is hardly to be expected that the young girl\'s sleep would be very\nsound that night, with her imagination filled with visions, hob\ngoblins of every form, size, and color.During the most of the forepart of the night she lay awake thinking\nover the strange things she had heard concerning the cave, and\nexpecting every moment to see some horrible monster make its\nappearance in the shape of an enormous Indian in his war paint, and\nhis hands reeking with blood.After a while she fell into a doze in which she had a horrid dream,\nwhere all the things she had been thinking of appeared and took form,\nbut assuming shapes ten times more horrible than any her waking\nimagination could possibly have created.She had started from one of these horrid dreams,\nand afraid to go to sleep again, lay quietly gazing around the cavern\non the ever varying reflections cast by the myriads of crystals that\nglittered upon the wall and ceiling.Although there were in some portions of the cavern walls chinks or\ncrevices which let in air, and during some portion of the day a few\nstraggling sunbeams, it was found necessary even during the day to\nkeep a lamp constantly burning.And the one standing on the table in\nthe centre of the cave was never allowed to go out.As we have said, Hellena lay awake gazing about her.A perfect stillness reigned in the cave, broken only by the rather\nheavy breathing of the Indian woman who slept soundly.Suddenly she heard, or thought she heard a slight grating noise at the\nfurther side of the cavern.or does she actually\nsee the wall of the cavern parting?Such actually seems to be the\ncase, and from the opening out steps a figure dressed like an Indian,\nand bearing in his hand a blazing torch.Hellena\'s tongue cleaves to the roof of her mouth, and her limbs are\nparalyzed with terror.The figure moves about the room with a step as noiseless as the step\nof the dead, while the crystals on the walls seem to be set in motion,\nand to blaze with unnatural brilliancy as his torch is carried from\nplace to place.He carefully examines everything as he proceeds; particularly the\nweapons belonging to the pirates, which seemed particularly to take\nhis fancy.But he carefully replaces everything after having examined\nit.He now approaches the place where the two women are lying.The figure approached the couch; for a moment he bent over it and\ngazed intently on the two women; particularly on that of the white\nmaiden.When having apparently satisfied his curiosity, he withdrew as\nstealthily as he had come.When Hellena opened her eyes again, the spectre had vanished, and\neverything about the cave appeared as if nothing unusual had happened.For a long time she lay quietly thinking over the strange occurrences\nof the night.She was in doubt whether scenes which she had witnessed\nwere real, or were only the empty creations of a dream.The horrible\nspectres which she had seen in the fore part of the night seemed like\nthose which visit us in our dreams when our minds are troubled.But\nthe apparition of the Indian seemed more real.or were the two\nscenes only different parts of one waking vision?To this last opinion she seemed most inclined, and was fully confirmed\nin the opinion that the cavern was haunted.Although Hellena was satisfied in her own mind that the figure that\nhad appeared so strangely was a disembodied spirit, yet she had a\nvague impression that she had somewhere seen that form before.But\nwhen, or where, she could not recollect.When in the morning she related the occurrences of the night to\nLightfoot, the Indian expressed no surprise, and exhibited no alarm.Nor did she attempt to offer any explanation seeming to treat it as a\nmatter of course.Although this might be unsatisfactory to Hellena in some respects, it\nwas perhaps after all, quite as well for her that Lightfoot did not\nexhibit any alarm at what had occurred, as by doing so she imparted\nsome of her own confidence to her more timid companion.All this while Black Bill had not been thought of but after a while he\ncrawled out from his bunk, his eyes twice their usual size, and coming\nup to Hellena, he said:\n\n"Misses, misses, I seed do debble last night wid a great fire-brand in\nhis hand, and he went all round de cabe, lookin\' for massa Flint, to\nburn him up, but he couldn\'t fine him so he went away agin.Now I know\nhe\'s comin\' after massa Flint, cause he didn\'t touch nobody else.""No; but I kept mighty still, and shut my eyes when he come to look at\nme, but he didn\'t say noffen, so I know\'d it wasn\'t dis darkey he was\nafter."This statement of the <DW64>\'s satisfied Hellena that she had not been\ndreaming when she witnessed the apparition of the Indian.On further questioning Bill, she found he had not witnessed any of the\nhorrid phantoms that had visited her in her dreams.As soon as Hellena could do so without attracting attention, she took\na lamp and examined the walls in every direction to see if she could\ndiscover any where a crevice large enough for a person to pass\nthrough, but she could find nothing of the sort.The walls were rough and broken in many parts, but there was nothing\nlike what she was in search of.She next questioned Lightfoot about it, asking her if there was any\nother entrance to the cave beside the one through which they had\nentered.But the Indian woman gave her no satisfaction, simply telling her that\nshe might take the lamp and examine for herself.As Hellena had already done this, she was of course as much in the\ndark as ever.When Captain Flint visited the cave again as he did on the following\nday, Hellena would have related to him the occurrences of the previous\nnight, but she felt certain that he would only laugh at it as\nsomething called up by her excited imagination, or treat it as a story\nmade up for the purpose of exciting his sympathy.Or perhaps invented for the purpose of arousing his superstition in\norder to make him leave the cave, and take her to some place where\nescape would be more easy.So she concluded to say nothing to him about it.About a week after the occurrence of the events recorded in the last\nchapter, Captain Flint and his crew were again assembled in the\ncavern.It was past midnight, and they evidently had business of\nimportance before them, for although the table was spread as upon the\nformer occasion, the liquors appeared as yet to be untasted, and\ninstead of being seated around the table, the whole party were sitting\non skins in a remote corner of the cavern, and conversing in a\nsuppressed tone of voice as if fearful of being heard."Something must be done," said one of the men, "to quiet this darn\nsuspicion, or it\'s all up with us.""I am for leaving at once," said Old Ropes; "the only safety for us\nnow is in giving our friends the slip, and the sooner we are out of\nthese waters the better it will be for us.""What, and leave the grand prize expecting to take care of itself?""Darn the prize," said Old Ropes, "the East Indiaman ain\'t expected\nthis two weeks yet, and if the suspicions agin us keep on increasin\'\nas they have for the last ten days, the land pirates\'ll have us all\nstrung up afore the vessel arrives."This opinion was shared by the majority of the men.Even the Parson\nwho took delight in opposing Old Ropes in almost every thing, agreed\nwith him here."Whether or not," said he, "I am afraid to face death in a fair\nbusiness-like way, you all know, but as sure as I\'m a genuine parson,\nI\'d rather be tortured to death by a band of savage Indians, than to\nbe strung up to a post with my feet dangling in the air to please a\nset of gaping fools.""Things do look rather squally on shore, I admit," said the captain,\n"but I\'ve hit upon a plan to remedy all that, and one that will make\nus pass for honest men, if not saints, long enough to enable us to\nfinish the little job we have on hand.""Why, merely to make a few captures while we are lying quietly in the\nharbour or a little way up the river.That\'ll turn the attention of\nthe people from us in another direction, in the mean while, we can\nbide our time."We must man a whale boat or two and\nattack some one of the small trading vessels that are coming in every\nday.She must be run on the rocks where she may be examined\nafterwards, so that any one may see that she has falling in the hands\nof pirates.None of the crew must be allowed to escape, as that would\nexpose the trick."All this must take place while I am known to be on shore, and the\nschooner lying in port."This plot, which was worthy the invention of a fiend, was approved by\nall but Jones Bradley who declared that he would have nothing to do\nwith it.For which disobedience of orders he would have probably been\nput to death had he been at sea.The plan of operations having been decided upon, the whole party\nseated themselves round the table for the purpose as they would say of\nmaking a night of it.But somehow or other they seemed to be in no humor for enjoyment, as\nenjoyment is understood by such characters.A gloom seemed to have settled on the whole party.They could not even get their spirits up, by pouring spirits down.And although they drank freely, they drank for the most part in\nsilence.shouted captain Flint, "at last have we all lost our\nvoices?Can no one favor us with a song, or toast or a yarn?"Hardly had these words passed the lips of the captain, when the\npiteous moan which had so startled the pirates, on the previous\nevening again saluted them, but in a more suppressed tone of voice.The last faint murmurs of this moan had not yet died away, when a\nshout, or rather a yell like an Indian war whoop, rang through the\ncavern in a voice that made the very walls tremble, its thousand\nechoes rolling away like distant thunder.The whole group sprang to their feet aghast.The two woman followed by Black Bill, terror stricken, joined the\ngroup.This at least might be said of Hellena and the <DW64>.The latter\nclinging to the skirts of the white maiden for protection, as a mortal\nin the midst of demons might be supposed to seek the protection of an\nAngel.Captain Flint, now laying his hand violently on Lightfoot, said, "What\ndoes all this mean?do you expect to frighten me by your juggling\ntricks, you infernal squaw?"At these words he gave her a push that\nsent her staggering to the floor.In a moment he saw his mistake, and went to her assistance (but she\nhad risen before he reached her,) and endeavored to conciliate her\nwith kind words and presents.He took a gold chain from his pocket, and threw it about her neck, and\ndrew a gold ring from his own finger and placed it upon hers.These attentions she received in moody silence.All this was done by Flint, not from any feelings of remorse for the\ninjustice he had done the woman, but from a knowledge of how much he\nwas in her power and how dangerous her enmity might be to him.Finding that she was not disposed to listen to him, he turned from her\nmuttering to himself:\n\n"She\'ll come round all right by and by," and then addressing his men\nsaid:\n\n"Boys, we must look into this matter; there\'s something about this\ncave we don\'t understand yet.There may be another one over it, or\nunder it.He did not repeat the explanation he had given before, feeling no\ndoubt, that it would be of no use.A careful examination of the walls of the cave were made by the whole\nparty, but to no purpose.Nothing was discovered that could throw any\nlight upon the mystery, and they were obliged to give it up.And thus they were compelled to let the matter rest for the present.When the morning came, the pirates all left with the exception of the\ncaptain, who remained, he said, for the purpose of making further\ninvestigations, but quite as much for the purpose of endeavoring to\nfind out whether or not, Lightfoot had anything to do with the\nproduction of the strange noises.But here again, he was fated to\ndisappointment.The Indian could not, or would not, give any\nsatisfactory explanation.The noises she contended were made by the braves of her nation who had\ngone to the spirit world, and who were angry because their sacred\ncavern had been profaned by the presence of the hated palefaces.Had he consulted Hellena, or Black Bill, his investigations would\nprobably have taken a different turn.The figure of the Indian having been seen by both Hellena and the\nblack, would have excited his curiosity if not his fears, and led him\nto look upon it as a more serious matter than he had heretofore\nsupposed.But he did not consult either of them, probably supposing them to be a\ncouple of silly individuals whose opinions were not worth having.If any doubt had remained in the minds of the men in regard to the\nsupernatural character of the noises which had startled them in the\ncave, they existed no longer.Even the Parson although generally ridiculing the idea of all sorts of\nghosts and hobgoblins, admitted that there was something in this\naffair that staggered him, and he joined with the others in thinking\nthat the sooner they shifted their quarters, the better."Don\'t you think that squaw had a hand in it?"asked one of the men:\n"didn\'t you notice how cool she took it all the while?""That\'s a fact," said the Parson; "it\'s strange I didn\'t think of that\nbefore.I shouldn\'t wonder if it wasn\'t after all, a plot contrived by\nher and some of her red-skinned brethren to frighten us out of the\ncave, and get hold of the plunder we\'ve got stowed away there."Some of the men now fell in with this opinion, and were for putting it\nto the proof by torturing Lightfoot until she confessed her guilt.The majority of the men, however, adhered to the original opinion that\nthe whole thing was supernatural, and that the more they meddled with\nit, the deeper they\'d get themselves into trouble."My opinion is," said Old Ropes, "that there\'s treasure buried there,\nand the whole thing\'s under a charm, cave, mountain, and all.""If there\'s treasure buried there," said the Parson, "I\'m for having a\nshare of it.""The only way to get treasure that\'s under charm," said Old Ropes, "is\nto break the charm that binds it, by a stronger charm.""It would take some blasting to get at treasure buried in that solid\nrock," said Jones Bradley."If we could only break the charm that holds the treasure, just as\nlike as not that solid rock would all turn into quicksand," replied\nOld Ropes."No; but I\'ve seen them as has," replied Old Ropes."And more than that," continued Old Ropes, "my belief is that Captain\nFlint is of the same opinion, though he didn\'t like to say so."I shouldn\'t wonder now, if he hadn\'t some charm he was tryin\', and\nthat was the reason why he stayed in the cave so much.""I rather guess the charm that keeps the captain so much in the cave\nis a putty face," dryly remarked one of the men.While these things had been going on at the cavern, and Captain Flint\nhad been pretending to use his influence with the Indians for the\nrecovery of Hellena, Carl Rosenthrall himself had not been idle in the\nmeantime.He had dealings with Indians of the various tribes along the river,\nand many from the Far North, and West, and he engaged them to make\ndiligent search for his daughter among their people, offering tempting\nrewards to any who would restore her, or even tell him to a certainty,\nwhere she was to be found.In order to induce Fire Cloud to restore her in case it should prove\nit was he who was holding her in captivity, he sent word to that\nchief, that if he would restore his child, he would not only not have\nhim punished, but would load him with presents.These offers, of course made through Captain Flint, who it was\nsupposed by Rosenthrall, had more opportunities than any one else of\ncommunicating with the old chief.How likely they would have been to reach the chief, even if he had\nbeen the real culprit, the reader can guess.In fact he had done all in his power to impress the Indian that to put\nhimself in the power of Rosenthrall, would be certain death to him.Thus more than a month passed without bringing to the distracted\nfather any tidings of his missing child.We may as well remark here, that Rosenthrall had lost his wife many\nyears before, and that Hellena was his only child, so that in losing\nher he felt that he had lost everything.The Indians whom he had employed to aid him in his search, informed\nhim that they could learn nothing of his daughter among their people,\nand some of them who were acquainted with Fire Cloud, told him that\nthe old chief protested he knew nothing of the matter.Could it be that Flint was playing him false?He could hardly think that it was Flint himself who had stolen his\nchild, for what motive could he have in doing it?The more he endeavored to unravel the mystery, the stranger and more\nmysterious it became.Notwithstanding the statements to the contrary made by the Indians,\nFlint persisted in giving it as his belief, that Fire Cloud had\ncarried off the girl and was still holding her a prisoner.He even\nsaid that the chief had admitted as much to him.Yet he was sure that\nif he was allowed to manage the affair in his own way, he should be\nable to bring the Indian to terms.It was about this time that the dark suspicions began to be whispered\nabout that Captain Flint was in some way connected with the horrible\npiracies that had recently been perpetrated on the coast, if he were\nnot in reality the leader of the desperate gang himself, by whom they\nhad been perpetrated.Those suspicions as we have seen, coming to Flint\'s own ears, had\ncaused him to plan another project still more horrible than the one he\nwas pursuing, in order to quiet those suspicions until he should have\nan opportunity of capturing the rich prize which was to be the\nfinishing stroke to his achievements in this part of the world.The suspicions in regard to Captain Flint had reached the ears of\nRosenthrall, as well as others, who had been secretly concerned with\nhim in his smuggling transactions, although in no way mixed up with\nhis piracies.Rosenthrall feared that in case these suspicions against Flint should\nlead to his arrest, the whole matter would come out and be exposed,\nleading to the disgrace if not the ruin, of all concerned.It was therefore with a feeling of relief, while joining in the\ngeneral expression of horror, that he heard of a most terrible piracy\nhaving been committed on the coast.Captain Flint\'s vessel was lying\nin port, and he was known to be in the city.There was one thing too connected with this affair that seemed to\nprove conclusively, that the suspicions heretofore harboured against\nthe captain were unjust.And that was the report brought by the crew of a fishing smack, that\nthey had seen a schooner answering to the description given of the\npirate, just before this horrible occurrence took place.Captain Flint now assumed the bearing of a man whose fair fame had\nbeen purified of some foul blot stain that had been unjustly cast upon\nit, one who had been honorably acquitted of base charges brought\nagainst him by enemies who had sought his ruin.He had not been ignorant, he said, of the dark suspicions that had\nbeen thrown out against him.But he had trusted to time to vindicate his character, and he had not\ntrusted in vain.Among the first to congratulate Captain Flint on his escape from the\ndanger with which he had been threatened, was Carl Rosenthrall.He admitted that he had been to some extent, tainted with suspicion,\nin common with others, for which he now asked his forgiveness.The pardon was of course granted by the captain, coupled with hope\nthat he would not be so easily led away another time.The facts in regard to this last diabolical act of the pirates were\nthese.Captain Flint, in accordance with the plan which he had decided upon,\nand with which the reader has already been made acquainted, fitted out\na small fishing vessel, manned by some of the most desperate of his\ncrew, and commanded by the Parson and Old Ropes.Most of the men went on board secretly at night, only three men\nappearing on deck when she set sail.In fact, no one to look at her, would take her for anything but an\nordinary fishing smack.They had not been out long, before they came in sight of a vessel\nwhich they thought would answer their purpose.It was a small brig\nengaged in trading along the coast, and such a vessel as under\nordinary circumstances they would hardly think worth noticing.But\ntheir object was not plunder this time, but simply to do something\nthat would shield them from the danger that threatened them on shore.The time seemed to favor them, for the night was closing in and there\nwere no other vessels in sight.On the pirates making a signal of distress, the commander of the brig\nbrought his vessel to, until the boat from the supposed smack could\nreach him, and the crew could make their wants known.To his surprise six men fully armed sprang upon his deck.To resist this force there were only himself, and two men, all\nunarmed.Of these the pirates made short work not deigning to answer the\nquestions put to them by their unfortunate victims.When they had murdered all on board, and thrown overboard such of the\ncargo as they did not want they abandoned the brig, knowing from the\ndirection of the wind, and the state of the tide, that she would soon\ndrift on the beach, and the condition in which she would be found,\nwould lead people to believe that she had been boarded by pirates, and\nall on board put to death.After having accomplished this hellish act, they turned their course\nhomeward, bringing the report that they had seen the notorious\npiratical schooner which had committed so many horrible depredations,\nleading every one to conclude that this was another of her terrible\ndeeds.Captain Flint, satisfied with the result of this last achievement,\nfelt himself secure for the present.He could now without fear of interruption, take time to mature his\nplans for carrying out his next grand enterprise, which was to be the\ncrowning one of all his adventures, and which was to enrich all\nengaged in it.Captain Flint\'s plan for the accomplishment of his last grand\nenterprise was, as soon as it should be announced to him by those he\nhad constantly on the lookout, that the expected vessel was in sight,\nto embark in a large whale boat which he had secretly armed, and\nfitted for the purpose.After killing the crew of the vessel they expected to capture, he\nwould tack about ship, and take her into some port where he could\ndispose of the vessel and cargo.As, in this case, it was his intention to abandon the country for\never, he removed under various pretences, all his most valuable\nproperty from the cavern.The schooner he was to leave in charge of Jones Bradley, under\npretence that it was necessary to do so, in order to divert suspicion\nfrom him when the thing should have been accomplished.The fact was, that as he should have no further use for the schooner,\nand having for some time past, feared that Bradley seemed to be too\ntender-hearted to answer his purpose, he had determined to abandon him\nand the schooner together.At last, news was brought to Captain Flint that a vessel answering the\none they were expecting was in sight.Flint who, with his crew of desperators, was lying at a place now\nknown as Sandy Hook, immediately started in pursuit.The doomed ship was making her\nway under a light breeze apparently unconscious of danger.There was one thing about the ship, that struck the pirates as rather\nunusual.There seemed to be more hands on board than were required to\nman such a vessel."I\'m afraid there\'s more work for us than we\'ve bargained for," said\none of the men."They seem to have a few passengers on board," remarked Flint, "but we\ncan soon dispose of them."The principal part of Flint\'s men had stretched themselves on the\nbottom of the boat for fear of exciting the suspicion of those on\nboard the ship by their numbers.As the pirate craft approached the merchant man, apparently with no\nhostile intention, those on board the ship were watching the boat as\nclosely as they were themselves watched.As soon as they came within hailing distance, the man at the bow of\nthe boat notified the captain of the ship that he wished to come along\nside, as he had something of importance to communicate.The captain of the ship commenced apparently making preparations to\nreceive the visit, when one of the men on deck who had been observing\nthe boat for some time came to him and said:\n\n"That\'s he.The man on the bow of the\nboat is the notorious pirate Flint."In a moment more they would be along side, and nothing could prevent\nthem from boarding the ship.In that moment the captain of the ship, by a skilful movement suddenly\ntacked his vessel about just as the pirates came up, coming in contact\nwith the boat in such a manner as to split her in two in a moment.A dozen men sprung up from the bottom of the boat, uttering horrid\ncurses while they endeavored to reach the ship or cling to portions of\ntheir shattered boat.The greater portion of them were drowned, as no efforts were made to\nrescue them.Three only succeeded in reaching the deck of the ship in safety, and\nthese would probably have rather followed their comrades had they\nknown how few were going to escape.These three were Captain Flint, the one called the Parson and Old\nRopes.These were at first disposed to show fight, but it was of no use.Their arms had been lost in their struggle in the water.They were soon overpowered and put in irons.Great was the excitement caused in the goodly little City of New York,\nby the arrival of the merchant ship bringing as prisoners, the daring\npirate with two of his men whose fearful deeds had caused all the\ninhabitants of the land to thrill with horror.And great was the surprise of the citizens to find in that terrible\npirate a well-known member of the community, and one whom nearly all\nregarded as a worthy member of society.Another cause of surprise to the good people of the city, was the\narrival by this vessel, of one whom all had long given up as lost, and\nthat was Henry Billings, the lover of Hellena Rosenthrall.He it was who had recognized in the commander of the whale boat, the\npirate Flint, and had warned the captain of the ship of his danger,\nthereby enabling him to save his vessel, and the lives of all on\nboard.Captain Flint made a slight mistake when he took the vessel by which\nhe was run down, for the India man he was looking out for.It was an\nordinary merchant ship from Amsterdam, freighted with merchandise from\nthat port.Though in appearance she very much resembled the vessel\nwhich Captain Flint had taken her for.The reason young Billings happened to be on board of her was this:\n\nIt will be remembered that when the ship in which Billings had taken\npassage for Europe, was attacked by the pirates, he was forced to walk\nthe plank.By the pirates, he was of course supposed to have been drowned, but in\nthis they were mistaken.He had been in the water but a few moments\nwhen he came in contact with a portion of a spar which had probably\ncome from some wreck or had been washed off of some vessel.To this he lashed himself with a large handkerchief which it was his\ngood fortune to have at the time.Lashed to this spar he passed the night.When morning came he found that he had drifted out to sea; he could\nnot tell how far.He was out of sight of land, and no sail met his anxious gaze.His strength was nearly exhausted, and he felt a stupor coming over\nhim.How long he lay in this condition he could not tell.When he came to\nhimself, he found that he was lying in the birth of a vessel, while a\nsailor was standing at his side.He had been discovered by the Captain of a ship bound for England,\nfrom Boston.He had been taken on board, in an almost lifeless condition, and\nkindly cared for.In a little while he recovered his usual strength, and although his\nreturn home must necessarily be delayed, he trusted to be enabled\nbefore a great while to do so and bring to justice the villains who\nhad attempted his murder.Unfortunately the vessel by which he had been rescued, was wrecked on\nthe coast of Ireland, he and the crew barely escaping with their\nlives.After a while, he succeeded in getting to England by working his\npassage there.From London, he made his way in the same manner, to Amsterdam, where\nthe mercantile house with which he was connected being known, he found\nno difficulty in securing a passage for New York.Billings now for the first time heard the story of Hellena\'s\nmysterious disappearance.It immediately occurred to him that Captain Flint was some way\nconcerned in the affair not withstanding his positive denial that he\nknew anything of the matter further than he had already made known.The capture of Captain Flint, and the other two pirates of course led\nto the arrest of Jones Bradley who had been left in charge of the\nschooner.He was found on board of the vessel, which was lying a short distance\nup the river, and arrested before he had learned the fate of his\ncomrades.He was cast into prison with the rest, though each occupied a separate\ncell.As no good reason could be given for delaying the punishment of the\nprisoners, their trial was commenced immediately.The evidence against them was too clear to make a long trial\nnecessary.They were all condemned to death with the exception of Jones Bradley,\nwhose punishment on account of his not engaged in last affair, and\nhaving recommended mercy in the case of Henry Billings, was committed\nto imprisonment for life.When the time came for the carrying out of sentence of the three who\nhad been condemned to death, it was found that one of them was missing\nand that one, the greatest villain of them all, Captain Flint himself!No one had visited him on the previous\nday but Carl Rosenthrall, and he was a magistrate, and surely he would\nbe the last one to aid in the escape of a prisoner!That he was gone however, was a fact.But If it were a fact that he had made his escape, it was equally\ntrue, that he could not have gone very far, and the community were not\nin the humor to let such a desperate character as he was now known to\nbe, escape without making a strenuous effort to recapture him.The execution of the two who had been sentenced to die at the same\ntime, was delayed for a few days in the hope of learning from them,\nthe places where Flint would most probably fly to, but they maintained\na sullen silence on the subject.They then applied to Jones Bradley with, at first, no better result.But when Henry Billings, who was one of those appointed to visit him,\nhappened to allude to the strange fate of Hellena Rosenthrall, he\nhesitated a moment, and then said he knew where the girl was, and that\nshe had been captured by Captain Flint, and kept in close confinement\nby him.He had no wish he said to betray his old commander, though he knew\nthat he had been treated badly by him, but he would like to save the\nyoung woman.Captain Flint might be in the same place, but if he was, he thought\nthat he would kill the girl sooner than give her up.If Captain Flint, was not there, the only ones in the cave besides the\ngirl, were a squaw, and Captain Flint\'s <DW64> boy, Bill.For the sake of the girl Bradley said he would guide a party to the\ncave.This offer was at once accepted, and a party well armed, headed by\nyoung Billings, and guided by Jones Bradley, set out immediately.When Captain Flint made his escape from prison, it naturally enough\noccurred to him, that the safest place for him for awhile, would be\nthe cave.In it he thought he could remain in perfect safety, until he should\nfind an opportunity for leaving the country.The cave, or at least the secret chamber, was unknown to any except\nhis crew, and those who were confined in it.On leaving the cave, the last time, with a heartlessness worthy a\ndemon, he had barred the entrance to the cavern on the outside, so as\nto render it impossible for those confined there to escape in that\ndirection.In fact, he had, be supposed, buried them alive--left them to die of\nhunger.Captain Flint reached the entrance of the cave in safety, and found\neverything as he had left it.On reaching the inner chamber where he had left the two women and the\n<DW64> boy, he was startled to find the place apparently deserted,\nwhile all was in total darkness, except where a few rays found their\nway through the crevices of the rocks.He called the names first of one, and then another, but the only\nanswer he received was the echo of his own voice.They certainly could not have made their escape, for the fastenings\nwere all as he had left them.The means of striking fire were at hand, and a lamp was soon lighted.He searched the cave, but could discover no trace of the missing ones.A strange horror came over him, such as he had never felt before.The stillness oppressed him; no living enemy could have inspired him\nwith the fear he now felt from being alone in this gloomy cavern."I must leave this place," he said, "I would rather be in prison than\nhere."Again he took up the lamp, and went round the cave, but more this time\nin hopes of finding some weapon to defend himself with, in case he\nshould be attacked, than with the hope of discovering the manner in\nwhich those he had left there had contrived to make their escape.It had been his custom, lately, on leaving the cavern, to take his\nweapons with him, not knowing what use might be made of them by the\nwomen under the provocation, to which they were sometimes subjected.The only weapon he could find was a large dagger.This he secured, and\nwas preparing to leave the cavern, when he thought he saw something\nmoving in one corner.In order to make sure that he had not been mistaken, he approached the\nplace.It was a corner where a quantity of skins had been thrown, and which\nit had not been convenient for him to remove, when he left the cavern.Thinking that one of these skins might be of service to him in the\nlife he would be obliged to live for some time, he commenced sorting\nthem over, for the purpose of finding one that would answer his\npurpose, when a figure suddenly sprang up from the pile.It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more frightened."Dat you, massa," at length exclaimed the familiar voice of Black\nBill."I tought it was de debil come back agin to carry me off."said Flint, greatly relieved, and glad to\nfind some one who could explain the strange disappearance of Hellena\nand Lightfoot.he asked; "where\'s the white girl and the\nIndian woman?""Debble carry dim off," said Bill."What do you mean, you black fool?"said his master; "if you don\'t\ntell me where they\'ve gone, I\'ll break your black skull for you.""Don\'t know where dar gone," said Bill, tremblingly, "Only know dat de\ndebble take dem away."Flint finding that he was not likely to get anything out of the boy by\nfrightening him, now changed his manner, saying;\n\n"Never mind, Bill, let\'s hear all about it."The boy reassured, now told his master that the night before while he\nwas lying awake near the pile of skins and the women were asleep, he\nsaw the walls of the cavern divide and a figure holding a blazing\ntorch such as he had never seen before, enter the room."I tought," said Bill, "dat it was de debble comin\' arter you agin,\nmassa, and I was \'fraid he would take me along, so I crawled under de\nskins, but I made a hole so dat I could watch what he was doin\'.""He looked all round a spell for you, massa, an\' when he couldn\'t find\nyou, den he went were de women was sleepin\' an woke dem up and made\ndem follow him."Den da called me and looked all ober for me an\' couldn\'t find me, an\'\nde debble said he couldn\'t wait no longer, an\' dat he would come for\nme annudder time, An den de walls opened agin, an\' da all went true\ntogedder.When I heard you in de cave, massa, I tought it was de\ndebble come agin to fetch me, an\' so I crawled under de skins agin."From this statement of the boy, Flint come to the conclusion that Bill\nmust have been too much frightened at the time to know what was\nactually taking place.One thing was certain, and that was the prisoners had escaped, and had\nbeen aided in their escape by some persons, to him unknown, in a most\nstrange and mysterious manner.Over and over again he questioned Black Bill, but every time with the\nsame result.The boy persisted in the statement, that he saw the whole party pass\nout through an opening in the walls of the cavern.That they had not passed out through the usual entrance was evident,\nfor he found everything as he had left it.Again he examined the walls of the cavern, only to be again baffled\nand disappointed.He began to think that may be after all, the cavern was under a spell\nof enchantment, and that the women had actually been carried off in\nthe manner described by the <DW64>.The boy was evidently honest in his statement, believing that he was\ntelling nothing that was not true.But be all this as it might, the mere presence of a human being, even\nthough a poor <DW64> boy, was sufficient to enable him to shake off the\nfeeling of loneliness and fear, with which he was oppressed upon\nentering the cavern.He now determined to remain in the cavern for a short time.Long enough at least to make a thorough examination of the place,\nbefore taking his departure.This determination of Captain Flint\'s was by no means agreeable to the\n<DW64> boy.Bill was anxious to leave the cave, and by that means escape the\nclutches of the devil, who was in the habit of frequenting it.He endeavored to induce Flint to change his resolution by assuring him\nthat he had heard the devil say that he was coming after him.But the\ncaptain only laughed at the boy, and he was compelled to remain.For several days after the departure of Captain Flint, the inmates of\nthe cavern felt no uneasiness at his absence; but when day after day\npassed, until more than a week had elapsed without his making his\nappearance they began to be alarmed.It had uniformly been the practice of Captain Flint on leaving the\ncave, to give Lightfoot charges to remain there until his return, and\nnot to allow any one to enter, or pass out during his absence.Singularly enough he had said nothing about it the last time.This,\nhowever, made no difference with Lightfoot, for if she thought of it\nat all, she supposed that he had forgotten it.Still she felt no\ndisposition to disobey his commands, although her feelings towards\nhim, since his late brutal treatment had very much changed.But their provisions were giving out, and to remain in the cavern much\nlonger, they must starve to death.Lightfoot therefore resolved to go\nin search of the means of preventing such a catastrophe, leaving the\nothers to remain in the cave until her return.On attempting to pass out, she found to her horror that the way was\nbarred against her from the outside.In vain she endeavored to force her way out.There seemed to be no alternative but to await patiently the return of\nthe captain.Failing in that, they must starve to death!Their supply of provisions was not yet quite exhausted, and they\nimmediately commenced putting themselves on short allowance, hoping by\nthat means to make them last until relief should come.While the two women were sitting together, talking over the matter,\nand endeavoring to comfort each other, Hellena noticing the plain gold\nring on the finger of Lightfoot, that had been placed there by Captain\nFlint during her quarrel with the Indian, asked to be allowed to look\nat it.On examining the ring, she at once recognized it as the one worn by\nher lost lover.Her suspicions in regard to Flint were now fully confirmed.She was\nsatisfied that he was in some way concerned in the sudden\ndisappearance of the missing man.Could it be possible that he had been put out of the way by this\nvillain, who, for some reason unknown to any but himself, was now\ndesirous of disposing of her also?That night the two women retired to rest as usual.It was a long time\nbefore sleep came to their relief.The clock which the pirates had hung in the cave, struck twelve, when\nHellena started from her slumber with a suppressed cry, for the figure\nshe had seen in the vision many nights ago, stood bending over her!But now it looked more like a being of real flesh and blood, than a\nspectre.And when it spoke to her, saying, "has the little paleface\nmaiden forgotten; no, no!"she recognized in the intruder, her old\nfriend the Indian chief, Fire Cloud.Hellena, the feelings of childhood returning, sprang up, and throwing\nher arms around the old chief, exclaimed:\n\n"Save me, no, no, save me!"Lightfoot was by this time awake also, and on her feet.To her the\nappearance of the chief seemed a matter of no surprise.Not that she\nhad expected anything of the kind, but she looked upon the cave as a\nplace of enchantment, and she believed that the spirits having it in\ncharge, could cause the walls to open and close again at pleasure.And\nshe recognized Fire Cloud as one of the chiefs of her own tribe.He\nwas also a descendant of one of its priests, and was acquainted with\nall the mysteries of the cavern.He told the prisoners that he had come to set them at liberty, and\nbade them follow.They had got everything for their departure, when they observed for\nthe first time that Black Bill was missing.They could not think of going without him, leaving him there to\nperish, but the cavern was searched for him in vain.His name was\ncalled to no better purpose, till they were at last compelled to go\nwithout him, the chief promising to return and make another search for\nhim, all of which was heard by the <DW64> from his hiding place under\nthe pile of skins as related in the preceding chapter.The chief, to the surprise of Hellena, instead of going to what might\nbe called the door of the cavern, went to one of the remote corners,\nand stooping down, laid hold of a projection of rock, and gave it a\nsudden pressure, when a portion of the wall moved aside, disclosing a\npassage, till then unknown to all except Fire Cloud himself.It was\none of the contrivances of the priests of the olden time, for the\npurpose of imposing upon the ignorant and superstitious multitude.On passing through this opening, which the chief carefully closed\nafter him, the party entered a narrow passageway, leading they could\nnot see where, nor how far.The Indian led the way, carrying his torch, and assisting them over\nthe difficulties of the way, when assistance was required.Thus he led them on, over rocks, and precipices, sometimes the path\nwidening until it might be called another cavern, and then again\nbecoming so narrow as to only allow one to pass at a time.Thus they journeyed on for the better part of a mile, when they\nsuddenly came to a full stop.It seemed to Hellena that nothing short of an enchanter\'s wand could\nopen the way for them now, when Fire Cloud, going to the end of the\npassage, gave a large slab which formed the wall a push on the lower\npart, causing it to rise as if balanced by pivots at the center, and\nmaking an opening through which the party passed, finding themselves\nin the open air, with the stars shining brightly overhead.As soon as they had passed out the rock swung back again, and no one\nunacquainted with the fact, would have supposed that common looking\nrock to be the door of the passage leading to the mysterious cavern.The place to which they now came, was a narrow valley between the\nmountains.Pursuing their journey up this valley, they came to a collection of\nIndian wigwams, and here they halted, the chief showing them into his\nown hut, which was one of the group.Another time, it would have alarmed Hellena Rosenthrall to find\nherself in the wilderness surrounded by savages.But now, although among savages far away from home, without a white\nface to look upon, she felt a degree of security, she had long been a\nstranger to.In fact she felt that the Indians under whose protection she now found\nherself, were far more human, far less cruel, than the demon calling\nhimself a white man, out of whose hands she had so fortunately\nescaped.For once since her capture, her sleep was quiet, and refreshing.Black Bill, on leaving the captain, after having vainly endeavored to\npersuade him to leave the cave, crawled in to his usual place for\npassing the night, but not with the hope of forgetting his troubles in\nsleep.He was more firmly than ever impressed with the idea that the cavern\nwas the resort of the Devil and his imps, and that they would\ncertainly return for the purpose of carrying off his master.To this\nhe would have no objection, did he not fear that they might nab him\nalso, in order to keep his master company.So when everything was perfectly still in the cavern excepting the\nloud breathing of the captain, which gave evidence of his being fast\nasleep, the <DW64> crept cautiously out of the recess, where he had\nthrown himself down, and moved noiselessly to the place where the\ncaptain was lying.Having satisfied himself that his master was asleep, he went to the\ntable, and taking the lamp that was burning there, he moved towards\nthe entrance of the cave.This was now fastened only on the inside,\nand the fastening could be easily removed.In a few moments Black Bill was at liberty.As soon as he felt himself free from the cave, he gave vent to a fit\nof boisterous delight, exclaiming.Now de debile may\ncome arter massa Flint as soon as he please, he ain\'t a goun to ketch\ndis chile, I reckan.Serb de captain right for trowin my fadder in de\nsea.Thus he went on until the thought seeming to strike him that he might\nbe overheard, and pursued, he stopped all at once, and crept further\ninto the forest and as he thought further out of the reach of the\ndevil.The morning had far advanced when captain Flint awoke from his\nslumber.He knew this from the few sunbeams that found their way through a\ncrevice in the rocks at one corner of the cave.With this exception the place was in total darkness, for the lamp as\nwe have said had been carried off by the <DW64>."Hello, there, Bill, you black imp," shouted the captain, "bring a\nlight."But Bill made no answer, although the command was several times\nrepeated.At last, Flint, in a rage, sprang up, and seizing a raw hide which he\nalways kept handy for such emergencies, he went to the sleeping place\nof the <DW64>, and struck a violent blow on the place where Bill ought\nto have been, but where Bill was not.Flint went back, and for a few moments sat down by the table in\nsilence.After awhile the horror at being alone in such a gloomy\nplace, once more came over him."Who knows," he thought, "but this black imp may betray me into the\nhands of my enemies.Even he, should he be so disposed, has it in his\npower to come at night, and by fastening the entrance of the cavern on\nthe outside, bury me alive!"So Flint reasoned, and so reasoning, made up his mind to leave the\ncavern.Flint had barely passed beyond the entrance of the cave, when he heard\nthe sound of approaching footsteps.He crouched under the bushes in\norder to watch and listen.He saw a party of six men approaching, all fully armed excepting one,\nwho seemed to be a guide to the rest.Flint fairly gnashed his teeth with rage as he recognised in this man\nhis old associate--Jones Bradley.The whole party halted at a little distance from the entrance to the\ncave, where Bradley desired them to remain while he should go and\nreconnoitre.He had reached the entrance, had made a careful examination of\neverything about it, and was in the act of turning to make his report,\nwhen Flint sprang upon him from the bushes, saying, "So it\'s you, you\ntraitor, who has betrayed me," at the same moment plunging his dagger\nin the breast of Bradley, who fell dead at his feet.In the next moment the pirate was flying through the forest.Several\nshots were fired at him, but without any apparent effect.But the pirate having the\nadvantage of a start and a better knowledge of the ground, was soon\nhidden from view in the intricacies of the forest.Still the party continued their pursuit, led now by Henry Billings.As the pirate did not return the fire of his pursuers, it was evident\nthat his only weapon was the dagger with which he had killed the\nunfortunate Bradley.For several hours they continued their search, but all to no purpose,\nand they were about to give it up for the present, when one of them\nstumbled, and fell over something buried in the grass, when up sprang\nBlack Bill, who had hidden there on hearing the approach of the party.asked the boy, as soon as he had\ndiscovered that he was among friends."Yes; can you tell us which way he has gone?""Gone dat way, and a-runnin\' as if de debble was arter him, an\' I\nguess he is, too."The party set off in the direction pointed out, the <DW64> following.After going about half a mile, they were brought to a full stop by a\nprecipice over which the foremost one of the party was near falling.As they came to the brink they thought they heard a whine and a low\ngrowl, as of a wild animal in distress.Looking into the ravine, a sight met their gaze, which caused them to\nshrink back with horror.At the bottom of the ravine lay the body of the man of whom they were\nin pursuit, but literally torn to pieces.Beside the body crouched an enormous she bear, apparently dying from\nwounds she had received from an encounter with the men.Could his worst enemy have wished him a severe punishment?"De debble got him now," said Black Bill, and the whole party took\ntheir way back to the cave.On their way back, Billings learned from the <DW64> that Hellena in\ncompany with Lightfoot, had left the cave several days previous to\ntheir coming.He was so possessed with the idea they had been spirited away by the\ndevil, or some one of his imps in the shape of an enormous Indian,\nthat they thought he must have been frightened out of his wits.Billings was at a loss what course to take, but he had made up his\nmind not to return to the city, until he had learned something\ndefinite in relation to the fate of his intended bride.In all probability, she was at some one of the Indian villages\nbelonging to some of the tribes occupying that part of the country.For this purpose he embarked again in the small vessel in which he had\ncome up the river, intending to proceed a short distance further up,\nfor the purpose of consulting an old chief who, with his family,\noccupied a small island situated there.He had proceeded but a short distance when he saw a large fleet of\ncanoes approaching.Supposing them to belong to friendly Indians, Billings made no attempt\nto avoid them, and his boat was in a few moments surrounded by the\nsavages.At first the Indians appeared to be perfectly friendly, offering to\ntrade and, seeming particularly anxious to purchase fire-arms.This aroused the suspicions of the white men, and they commenced\nendeavoring to get rid of their troublesome visitors, when to their\nastonishment, they were informed that they were prisoners!Billings was surprised to find that the Indians, after securing their\nprisoners, instead of starting up the river again, continued their\ncourse down the stream.But what he learned shortly after from one of the Indians, who spoke\nEnglish tolerably well, astonished him still more.And that was, that\nhe was taken for the notorious pirate Captain Flint, of whose escape\nthey had heard from some of their friends recently from the city, and\nthey thought that nothing would please their white brethren so much as\nto bring him back captive.It was to no purpose that Billings endeavored to convince them of\ntheir mistake.They only shook their heads, as much as to say it was\nof no use, they were not to be so easily imposed upon.And so Billings saw there was no help for it but to await patiently\nhis arrival at New York, when all would be set right again.But in the meantime Hellena might be removed far beyond his reach.Great was the mortification in the city upon learning the mistake they\nhad made.Where they had expected to receive praise and a handsome reward for\nhaving performed a meritorious action, they obtained only censure and\nreproaches for meddling in matters that did not concern them.It was only a mistake however, and there was no help for it.And\nBillings, although greatly vexed and disappointed, saw no course left\nfor him but to set off again, although he feared that the chances of\nsuccess were greatly against him this time, on account of the time\nthat had been lost.The Indians, whose unfortunate blunder had been the cause of this\ndelay, in order to make some amends for the wrong they had done him,\nnow came forward, and offered to aid him in his search for the missing\nmaiden.They proffered him the use of their canoes to enable him to ascend the\nstreams, and to furnish guides, and an escort to protect him while\ntraveling through the country.This offer, so much better than he had any reason to expect, was\ngladly accepted by Billings, and with two friends who had volunteered\nto accompany him, he once more started up the river, under the\nprotection of his new friends.War had broken out among the various tribes on the route which he must\ntravel, making it unsafe for him and his two companions, even under\nsuch a guide and escort as his Indian friends could furnish them.Thus he with his two associates were detained so long in the Indian\ncountry, that by their friends at home they were given up as lost.At last peace was restored, and they set out on their return.The journey home was a long and tedious one, but nothing occurred\nworth narrating.Upon reaching the Hudson, they employed an Indian to take them the\nremainder of the way in a canoe.Upon reaching Manhattan Island, the first place they stopped at was\nthe residence of Carl Rosenthrall, Billings intending that the father\nof Hellena should be the first to hear the sad story of his failure\nand disappointment.It was evening when he arrived at the house and the lamps were lighted\nin the parlor.With heavy heart and trembling hands he rapped at the door.As the door opened he uttered a faint cry of surprise, which was\nanswered by a similar one by the person who admitted him.The scene that followed we shall not attempt to describe.At about the same time that Henry Billings, under the protection of\nhis Indian friends, set out on his last expedition up the river, a\nsingle canoe with four persons in it, put out from under the shadow of\nOld Crow Nest, on its way down the stream.The individual by whom the canoe was directed was an Indian, a man\nsomewhat advanced in years.The others were a white girl, an Indian\nwoman, and a <DW64> boy.In short, the party consisted of Fire Cloud, Hellena Rosenthrall,\nLightfoot, and Black Bill, on their way to the city.They had passed the fleet of canoes in which Billings had embarked,\nbut not knowing whether it belonged to a party of friendly Indians or\notherwise.Fire Cloud had avoided coming in contact with it for fear of being\ndelayed, or of the party being made prisoners and carried back again.Could they have but met, what a world of trouble would it not have\nsaved to all parties interested!As it was, Hellena arrived in safety, greatly to the delight of her\nfather and friends, who had long mourned for her as for one they never\nexpected to see again in this world.The sum of Hellena\'s happiness would now have been complete, had it\nnot been for the dark shadow cast over it by the absence of her lover.And this shadow grew darker, and darker, as weeks, and months, rolled\nby without bringing any tidings of the missing one.What might have been the effects of the melancholy into which she was\nfast sinking, it is hard to tell, had not the unexpected return of the\none for whose loss she was grieving, restored her once more to her\nwonted health and spirits.And here we might lay down our pen, and call our story finished, did\nwe not think that justice to the reader, required that we should\nexplain some things connected with the mysterious, cavern not yet\naccounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she\nhad seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but\nwe have not yet explained how the noises were produced which so\nalarmed the pirates.It will be remembered that the sleeping place of Black Bill was a\nrecess in the wall of the cavern.Now in the wall, near the head of the <DW64>\'s bed, there was a deep\nfissure or crevice.It happened that Bill while lying awake one night,\nto amuse himself, put his month to the crevice and spoke some words,\nwhen to his astonishment, what he had said, was repeated over and\nover, again.Black Bill in his ignorance and simplicity, supposed that the echo,\nwhich came back, was an answer from some one on the other side of the\nwall.Having made this discovery, he repeated the experiment a number of\ntimes, and always with the same result.After awhile, he began to ask questions of the spirit, as he supposed\nit to be, that had spoken to him.Among other things he asked if the devil was coming after master.The echo replied, "The debil comin\' after master," and repeated it a\ngreat many times.Bill now became convinced that it was the devil himself that he had\nbeen talking to.On the night when the pirates were so frightened by the fearful groan,\nBill was lying awake, listening to the captain\'s story.When he came\nto the part where he describes the throwing the boy\'s father\noverboard, and speaks of the horrible groan, Bill put his mouth to the\ncrevice, and imitated the groan, which had been too deeply fixed in\nhis memory ever to be forgotten, giving full scope to his voice.The effect astonished and frightened him as well as the pirates.With the same success he imitated the Indian war-whoop, which he had\nlearned while among the savages.The next time that the pirates were so terribly frightened, the alarm\nwas caused by Fire Cloud after his visit to the cave on the occasion\nthat he had been taken for the devil by Bill, and an Indian ghost by\nHellena.Fire Cloud had remained in another chamber of the cavern connected\nwith the secret passage already described, and where the echo was even\nmore wonderful than the one pronounced from the opening through which\nthe <DW64> had spoken.Here he could hear all that was passing in the great chamber occupied\nby the pirates, and from this chamber the echoes were to those who did\nnot understand their cause, perfectly frightful.All these peculiarities of the cavern had been known to the ancient\nIndian priests or medicine men, and by them made use of to impose on\ntheir ignorant followers.BEADLE\'S FRONTIER

wounded man?I\ncannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you\nspeak French I crawled out.DOCTOR\n\nHow were you wounded?PEASANT\n\nI was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have\nthought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._\n\nThey must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,\ngentlemen?MAURICE\n\nDon\'t you know?PEASANT\n\nWhat can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that\'s all I\nknow.Just look at it, I have been watching\nit all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nSit down near us.MAURICE\n\nListen, sit down here.They are\ncrying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of\nit by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._\n\nMAURICE\n\nSit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Muttering._\n\nSit down, sit down!DOCTOR\n\n_Uneasily._\n\nWhat is it?MAURICE\n\nWhat an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE\n\n_Agitated._\n\nThey shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a\nrabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._\n\nPEASANT\n\nI look like a rabbit!JEANNE\n\nDo you hear, Emil?_Laughs._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nJeanne!JEANNE\n\nIt makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake\nus for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just\npicture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE\n\nNo, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._\n\nAnd what else are we?PEASANT\n\n_Laughs._\n\nAnd now we must hide in the ground--\n\nJEANNE\n\n_In the same tone._\n\nAnd they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nMy dear!MAURICE\n\n_To the doctor._\n\nListen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE\n\nNo, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I\nwas forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,\nI am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so\nquiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"\nwas it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like\nthunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is\nit so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE\n\n_To the chauffeur._\n\nMy dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR\n\nYes, yes!JEANNE\n\n_Suddenly cries, threatening._\n\nBut I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._\n\nI cannot!EMIL GRELIEU\n\nAll will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE\n\n_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._\n\nI cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU\n\nAll will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR\n\nIn a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU\n\n_Faintly._\n\nJeanne!JEANNE\n\nYes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--\n\n_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._\n\nGIRL\n\nTell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._\n\nMAURICE\n\nWho is that?JEANNE\n\nEmil, it is that girl!_Laughs._\n\nShe is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR\n\n_Grumbles._\n\nWhat is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look\nwild.The peasant is laughing._\n\nPEASANT\n\nShe is here again?CHAUFFEUR\n\nLet me have the light!GIRL\n\n_Loudly._\n\nHow can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nMaurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--\n\nCHAUFFEUR\n\nPut down the lantern!GIRL\n\n_Shouts._\n\nHands off!No, no, you will not dare--\n\nMAURICE\n\nYou can\'t catch her--\n\n_The girl runs away._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nDoctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--\n\n_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._\n\nPEASANT\n\nShe asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl\'s voice resounds in the dark and then there is\nsilence._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nYou must catch her!MAURICE\n\nBut how, father?Jeanne\nbreaks into muffled laughter._\n\nMAURICE\n\n_Mutters._\n\nNow he is gone!CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Triumphantly._\n\nTake your seats!MAURICE\n\nBut the doctor isn\'t here.CHAUFFEUR\n\nLet us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_\n\nCHAUFFEUR\n\n_Angrily._\n\nI must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE\n\n_Shouts._\n\nLangloi!_A faint echo in the distance._\n\nCome!_The response is nearer._\n\nPEASANT\n\nHe did not catch her.She asked me, too,\nabout the road to Lonua._Laughs._\n\nThere are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU\n\n_Imploringly._\n\nJeanne!JEANNE\n\nBut I cannot, Emil.I used\nto understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._\n\nWhere is Pierre?MAURICE\n\nOh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we\'ll start in a moment!JEANNE\n\nYes, yes, we\'ll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._\n\nJEANNE\n\n_Frightened._\n\nWho is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,\nterrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._\n\nI cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nHe is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU\n\nHe is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium\nwill live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with\nyou--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the\nlight to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with\nblossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with\nblossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun\nwill shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little\nheads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm\nleaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,\nyou are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,\nJeanne, I see a new life!Though her brougham produced a sensation in the unfashionable streets\ninto which she directed it, she was never annoyed.Her maid went with\nher into the shops, and one of the grooms always stood at the door\nwithin call, to the intense delight of the neighborhood.And one day she\nfound what, from her point of view, was a perfect gem.It was a poor,\ncheap-looking, tarnished silver medal, a half-dollar once, undoubtedly,\nbeaten out roughly into the shape of a heart and engraved in script by\nthe jeweller of some country town.On one side were two clasped hands\nwith a wreath around them, and on the reverse was this inscription:\n"From Henry Burgoyne to his beloved friend Lewis L. Lockwood"; and\nbelow, "Through prosperity and adversity."And here it\nwas among razors and pistols and family Bibles in a pawnbroker\'s window.These two boy friends, and their boyish\nfriendship that was to withstand adversity and prosperity, and all that\nremained of it was this inscription to its memory like the wording on a\ntomb!"He couldn\'t have got so much on it any way," said the pawnbroker,\nentering into her humor."I didn\'t lend him more\'n a quarter of a dollar\nat the most."Miss Catherwaight stood wondering if the Lewis L. Lockwood could be\nLewis Lockwood, the lawyer one read so much about.Then she remembered\nhis middle name was Lyman, and said quickly, "I\'ll take it, please."She stepped into the carriage, and told the man to go find a directory\nand look for Lewis Lyman Lockwood.The groom returned in a few minutes\nand said there was such a name down in the book as a lawyer, and that\nhis office was such a number on Broadway; it must be near Liberty."Go\nthere," said Miss Catherwaight.Her determination was made so quickly that they had stopped in front of\na huge pile of offices, sandwiched in, one above the other, until they\ntowered mountains high, before she had quite settled in her mind what\nshe wanted to know, or had appreciated how strange her errand might\nappear.Lockwood was out, one of the young men in the outer office\nsaid, but the junior partner, Mr.Latimer, was in and would see her.She had only time to remember that the junior partner was a dancing\nacquaintance of hers, before young Mr.Latimer stood before her smiling,\nand with her card in his hand.Lockwood is out just at present, Miss Catherwaight," he said, "but\nhe will be back in a moment.Won\'t you come into the other room and\nwait?I\'m sure he won\'t be away over five minutes.She saw that he was surprised to see her, and a little ill at ease as\nto just how to take her visit.He tried to make it appear that he\nconsidered it the most natural thing in the world, but he overdid it,\nand she saw that her presence was something quite out of the common.This did not tend to set her any more at her ease.She already regretted\nthe step she had taken.What if it should prove to be the same Lockwood,\nshe thought, and what would they think of her?Lockwood," she said, as she\nfollowed him into the inner office."I fear I have come upon a very\nfoolish errand, and one that has nothing at all to do with the law.""Not a breach of promise suit, then?""Perhaps it is only an innocent subscription to a most worthy charity.I\nwas afraid at first," he went on lightly, "that it was legal redress you\nwanted, and I was hoping that the way I led the Courdert\'s cotillion\nhad made you think I could conduct you through the mazes of the law as\nwell.""No," returned Miss Catherwaight, with a nervous laugh; "it has to do\nwith my unfortunate collection.This is what brought me here," she said,\nholding out the silver medal."I came across it just now in the Bowery.The name was the same, and I thought it just possible Mr.Lockwood would\nlike to have it; or, to tell you the truth, that he might tell me what\nhad become of the Henry Burgoyne who gave it to him."Young Latimer had the medal in his hand before she had finished\nspeaking, and was examining it carefully.He looked up with just a touch\nof color in his cheeks and straightened himself visibly."Please don\'t be offended," said the fair collector.You\'ve heard of my stupid collection, and I know you think\nI meant to add this to it.But, indeed, now that I have had time to\nthink--you see I came here immediately from the pawnshop, and I was\nso interested, like all collectors, you know, that I didn\'t stop to\nconsider.That\'s the worst of a hobby; it carries one rough-shod over\nother people\'s feelings, and runs away with one.I beg of you, if you do\nknow anything about the coin, just to keep it and don\'t tell me, and I\nassure you what little I know I will keep quite to myself."Young Latimer bowed, and stood looking at her curiously, with the medal\nin his hand."I hardly know what to say," he began slowly.You say you found this on the Bowery, in a pawnshop.Well, of\ncourse, you know Mr.Miss Catherwaight shook her head vehemently and smiled in deprecation."This medal was in his safe when he lived on Thirty-fifth Street at\nthe time he was robbed, and the burglars took this with the rest of the\nsilver and pawned it, I suppose.Lockwood would have given more for\nit than any one else could have afforded to pay."He paused a moment,\nand then continued more rapidly: "Henry Burgoyne is Judge Burgoyne.Lockwood and he were friends when they\nwere boys.They were Damon\nand Pythias and that sort of thing.They roomed together at the State\ncollege and started to practise law in Tuckahoe as a firm, but they made\nnothing of it, and came on to New York and began reading law again with\nFuller & Mowbray.It was while they were at school that they had these\nmedals made.There was a mate to this, you know; Judge Burgoyne had it.Well, they continued to live and work together.They were both orphans\nand dependent on themselves.I suppose that was one of the strongest\nbonds between them; and they knew no one in New York, and always spent\ntheir spare time together.They were pretty poor, I fancy, from all\nMr.Lockwood has told me, but they were very ambitious.They were--I\'m\ntelling you this, you understand, because it concerns you somewhat:\nwell, more or less.They were great sportsmen, and whenever they could\nget away from the law office they would go off shooting.I think they\nwere fonder of each other than brothers even.Lockwood\ntell of the days they lay in the rushes along the Chesapeake Bay waiting\nfor duck.He has said often that they were the happiest hours of his\nlife.That was their greatest pleasure, going off together after duck or\nsnipe along the Maryland waters.Well, they grew rich and began to know\npeople; and then they met a girl.It seems they both thought a great\ndeal of her, as half the New York men did, I am told; and she was the\nreigning belle and toast, and had other admirers, and neither met with\nthat favor she showed--well, the man she married, for instance.But for\na while each thought, for some reason or other, that he was especially\nfavored.Lockwood never spoke of it\nto me.But they both fell very deeply in love with her, and each thought\nthe other disloyal, and so they quarrelled; and--and then, though the\nwoman married, the two men kept apart.It was the one great passion\nof their lives, and both were proud, and each thought the other in the\nwrong, and so they have kept apart ever since.And--well, I believe that\nis all."Miss Catherwaight had listened in silence and with one little gloved\nhand tightly clasping the other.Latimer, indeed," she began, tremulously, "I am terribly\nashamed of myself.I seemed to have rushed in where angels fear to\ntread.Of course I might\nhave known there was a woman in the case, it adds so much to the story.But I suppose I must give up my medal.I never could tell that story,\ncould I?""No," said young Latimer, dryly; "I wouldn\'t if I were you."Something in his tone, and something in the fact that he seemed to avoid\nher eyes, made her drop the lighter vein in which she had been speaking,\nand rise to go.There was much that he had not told her, she suspected,\nand when she bade him good-by it was with a reserve which she had not\nshown at any other time during their interview.she murmured, as young Latimer turned\nfrom the brougham door and said "Home," to the groom.She thought about\nit a great deal that afternoon; at times she repented that she had given\nup the medal, and at times she blushed that she should have been carried\nin her zeal into such an unwarranted intimacy with another\'s story.She determined finally to ask her father about it.He would be sure to\nknow, she thought, as he and Mr.Then\nshe decided finally not to say anything about it at all, for Mr.Catherwaight did not approve of the collection of dishonored honors\nas it was, and she had no desire to prejudice him still further by a\nrecital of her afternoon\'s adventure, of which she had no doubt but he\nwould also disapprove.So she was more than usually silent during\nthe dinner, which was a tete-a-tete family dinner that night, and she\nallowed her father to doze after it in the library in his great chair\nwithout disturbing him with either questions or confessions.{Illustration with caption: "What can Mr.Lockwood be calling upon me\nabout?"}They had been sitting there some time, he with his hands folded on the\nevening paper and with his eyes closed, when the servant brought in a\ncard and offered it to Mr.Catherwaight fumbled\nover his glasses, and read the name on the card aloud: "\'Mr.Miss Catherwaight sat upright, and reached out for the card with a\nnervous, gasping little laugh."Oh, I think it must be for me," she said; "I\'m quite sure it is\nintended for me.I was at his office to-day, you see, to return him some\nkeepsake of his that I found in an old curiosity shop.Something with\nhis name on it that had been stolen from him and pawned.You needn\'t go down, dear; I\'ll see him.It was I he asked for,\nI\'m sure; was it not, Morris?"Morris was not quite sure; being such an old gentleman, he thought it\nmust be for Mr.He did not like to disturb\nhis after-dinner nap, and he settled back in his chair again and\nrefolded his hands."I hardly thought he could have come to see me," he murmured, drowsily;\n"though I used to see enough and more than enough of Lewis Lockwood\nonce, my dear," he added with a smile, as he opened his eyes and nodded\nbefore he shut them again."That was before your mother and I were\nengaged, and people did say that young Lockwood\'s chances at that time\nwere as good as mine.He was very attentive,\nthough; _very_ attentive."Miss Catherwaight stood startled and motionless at the door from which\nshe had turned.she asked quickly, and in a very low voice.Catherwaight did not deign to open his eyes this time, but moved his\nhead uneasily as if he wished to be let alone."To your mother, of course, my child," he answered; "of whom else was I\nspeaking?"Miss Catherwaight went down the stairs to the drawing-room slowly, and\npaused half-way to allow this new suggestion to settle in her mind.There was something distasteful to her, something that seemed not\naltogether unblamable, in a woman\'s having two men quarrel about her,\nneither of whom was the woman\'s husband.And yet this girl of whom\nLatimer had spoken must be her mother, and she, of course, could do no\nwrong.It was very disquieting, and she went on down the rest of the way\nwith one hand resting heavily on the railing and with the other pressed\nagainst her cheeks.It now seemed to her very\nsad indeed that these two one-time friends should live in the same city\nand meet, as they must meet, and not recognize each other.She argued\nthat her mother must have been very young when it happened, or she would\nhave brought two such men together again.Her mother could not have\nknown, she told herself; she was not to blame.For she felt sure that\nhad she herself known of such an accident she would have done something,\nsaid something, to make it right.And she was not half the woman her\nmother had been, she was sure of that.There was something very likable in the old gentleman who came forward\nto greet her as she entered the drawing-room; something courtly and of\nthe old school, of which she was so tired of hearing, but of which she\nwished she could have seen more in the men she met.Latimer\nhad accompanied his guardian, exactly why she did not see, but she\nrecognized his presence slightly.He seemed quite content to remain in\nthe background.Lockwood, as she had expected, explained that he had\ncalled to thank her for the return of the medal.He had it in his hand\nas he spoke, and touched it gently with the tips of his fingers as\nthough caressing it."I knew your father very well," said the lawyer, "and I at one time had\nthe honor of being one of your mother\'s younger friends.That was before\nshe was married, many years ago."He stopped and regarded the girl\ngravely and with a touch of tenderness."You will pardon an old man, old\nenough to be your father, if he says," he went on, "that you are greatly\nlike your mother, my dear young lady--greatly like.Your mother was\nvery kind to me, and I fear I abused her kindness; abused it by\nmisunderstanding it.There was a great deal of misunderstanding; and\nI was proud, and my friend was proud, and so the misunderstanding\ncontinued, until now it has become irretrievable."He had forgotten her presence apparently, and was speaking more to\nhimself than to her as he stood looking down at the medal in his hand."You were very thoughtful to give me this," he continued; "it was very\ngood of you.I don\'t know why I should keep it though, now, although I\nwas distressed enough when I lost it.But now it is only a reminder of\na time that is past and put away, but which was very, very dear to me.Perhaps I should tell you that I had a misunderstanding with the friend\nwho gave it to me, and since then we have never met; have ceased to\nknow each other.But I have always followed his life as a judge and as a\nlawyer, and respected him for his own sake as a man.I cannot tell--I do\nnot know how he feels toward me."The old lawyer turned the medal over in his hand and stood looking down\nat it wistfully.The cynical Miss Catherwaight could not stand it any longer.Lockwood," she said, impulsively, "Mr.Latimer has told me why\nyou and your friend separated, and I cannot bear to think that it\nwas she--my mother--should have been the cause.She could not have\nunderstood; she must have been innocent of any knowledge of the trouble\nshe had brought to men who were such good friends of hers and to each\nother.It seems to me as though my finding that coin is more than a\ncoincidence.I somehow think that the daughter is to help undo the harm\nthat her mother has caused--unwittingly caused.Keep the medal and don\'t\ngive it back to me, for I am sure your friend has kept his, and I am\nsure he is still your friend at heart.Don\'t think I am speaking hastily\nor that I am thoughtless in what I am saying, but it seems to me as if\nfriends--good, true friends--were so few that one cannot let them go\nwithout a word to bring them back.But though I am only a girl, and a\nvery light and unfeeling girl, some people think, I feel this very\nmuch, and I do wish I could bring your old friend back to you again as I\nbrought back his pledge.""It has been many years since Henry Burgoyne and I have met," said the\nold man, slowly, "and it would be quite absurd to think that he still\nholds any trace of that foolish, boyish feeling of loyalty that we once\nhad for each other.Yet I will keep this, if you will let me, and I\nthank you, my dear young lady, for what you have said.I thank you from\nthe bottom of my heart.You are as good and as kind as your mother was,\nand--I can say nothing, believe me, in higher praise."He rose slowly and made a movement as if to leave the room, and then,\nas if the excitement of this sudden return into the past could not\nbe shaken off so readily, he started forward with a move of sudden\ndetermination."I think," he said, "I will go to Henry Burgoyne\'s house at once,\nto-night.I will see if this has\nor has not been one long, unprofitable mistake.If my visit should\nbe fruitless, I will send you this coin to add to your collection of\ndishonored honors, but if it should result as I hope it may, it will be\nyour doing, Miss Catherwaight, and two old men will have much to thank\nyou for.Good-night," he said as he bowed above her hand, "and--God\nbless you!"Miss Catherwaight flushed slightly at what he had said, and sat looking\ndown at the floor for a moment after the door had closed behind him.Latimer moved uneasily in his chair.The routine of the office\nhad been strangely disturbed that day, and he now failed to recognize\nin the girl before him with reddened cheeks and trembling eyelashes the\ncold, self-possessed young woman of society whom he had formerly known."You have done very well, if you will let me say so," he began, gently."I hope you are right in what you said, and that Mr.Lockwood will not\nmeet with a rebuff or an ungracious answer.Why," he went on quickly, "I\nhave seen him take out his gun now every spring and every fall for the\nlast ten years and clean and polish it and tell what great shots he and\nHenry, as he calls him, used to be.And then he would say he would take\na holiday and get off for a little shooting.He would\nput the gun back into its case again and mope in his library for days\nafterward.You see, he never married, and though he adopted me, in a\nmanner, and is fond of me in a certain way, no one ever took the place\nin his heart his old friend had held.""You will let me know, will you not, at once,--to-night, even,--whether\nhe succeeds or not?""You can\nunderstand why I am so deeply interested.I see now why you said I\nwould not tell the story of that medal.But, after all, it may be the\nprettiest story, the only pretty story I have to tell."Lockwood had not returned, the man said, when young Latimer reached\nthe home the lawyer had made for them both.He did not know what to\nargue from this, but determined to sit up and wait, and so sat smoking\nbefore the fire and listening with his sense of hearing on a strain for\nthe first movement at the door.The front door shut with a clash, and he heard\nMr.Lockwood crossing the hall quickly to the library, in which he\nwaited.Then the inner door was swung back, and Mr.Lockwood came in\nwith his head high and his eyes smiling brightly.There was something in his step that had not been there before,\nsomething light and vigorous, and he looked ten years younger.He\ncrossed the room to his writing-table without speaking and began tossing\nthe papers about on his desk.Then he closed the rolling-top lid with a\nsnap and looked up smiling."I shall have to ask you to look after things at the office for a little\nwhile," he said."Judge Burgoyne and I are going to Maryland for a few\nweeks\' shooting."VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS\n\n\nIt was very hot in the Park, and young Van Bibber, who has a good heart\nand a great deal more money than good-hearted people generally get, was\ncross and somnolent.He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to\ntry to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o\'clock, and the groom had\nnot appeared.He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into\na by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin\nswans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake.They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he\npitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to\nbe measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in\nhaving some one paddle them around an artificial lake.Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older\ngirl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and\ngazed at the swans.The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on.But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk\nleading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing,\nso he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained\nwhere he was."I s\'pose," said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school\nvoice, "there\'s lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can\'t see\nfrom the banks.""Oh, lots," assented the girl with long hair."If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could\nsee all there is to see," said the third, "except what there\'s in the\nmiddle where the island is.""I guess it\'s mighty wild on that island," suggested the youngest."Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day.He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and\nthat it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island."asked the other one, in a hushed voice."Well, wild things," explained the elder, vaguely; "bears and animals\nlike that, that grow in wild places."Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and\nunreservedly to listen."My, but I\'d like to take a trip just once," said the youngest,\nunder her breath.Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up\nanxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach.Ain\'t you having a good time\n\'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?"Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on\nthe swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire,\nthey should not gratify it."Why, it costs more\'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open\ncar," added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question.The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but\nblinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the\nred seats."I beg your pardon," said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to\nthe eldest girl with long hair, "but if the little girl would like to go\naround in one of those things, and--and hasn\'t brought the change with\nher, you know, I\'m sure I should be very glad if she\'d allow me to send\nher around."exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply\nand in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered."I\'m afraid maw wouldn\'t like our taking money from any one we didn\'t\nknow," she said with dignity; "but if you\'re going anyway and want\ncompany--"\n\n"Oh!my, no," said Van Bibber, hurriedly.He tried to picture himself\nriding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from\nthe East Side, and a lunch basket."Then," said the head of the trio, "we can\'t go."There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on\nthe part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable.He\nlooked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately,\n"Well, come along."The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the\npaddling, smiled at Van Bibber\'s riding-breeches, which were so very\nloose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves\nand crop.The three little girls\nplaced the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle\none, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.They were hushed in silent\necstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it\ncareened slightly in turning.It was shady under the awning, and the\nmotion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would\nsee him that he failed to enjoy it.But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by\nthe bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to\nplay the host.He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges\nof the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling\ntheir feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the\npossibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island,\nalthough the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a\nsupposition doubtful.And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he\never enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a\nrecord-breaking steamship.It seemed long enough before they got back to\nVan Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied.Still,\nall the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that\nordeal again.He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long\nhair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man\nwho had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had\ndone; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with\nA Girl He Knew and Her brother.Her brother said, "How\'re you, Van Bibber?Been taking a trip around\nthe world in eighty minutes?"And added in a low voice, "Introduce me to\nyour young lady friends from Hester Street.""Ah, how\'re you--quite a surprise!"gasped Van Bibber, while his late\nguests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit,\nand utterly refused to move on."Been taking ride on the lake,"\nstammered Van Bibber; "most exhilarating.Young friends of mine--these\nyoung ladies never rode on lake, so I took \'em."Oh, yes, we saw you," said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at\nhim, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber\ngrew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the\nswans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string."There," said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, "now\nyou can take trips for a week without stopping.Don\'t try to smuggle in\nany laces, and don\'t forget to fee the smoking-room steward."The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that\nhe had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his\nreward for taking care of the young ladies.And the three little girls\nproceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were\nsunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of\na big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather\nriding-boots and baggy breeches.VAN BIBBER\'S BURGLAR\n\n\nThere had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her\nthere, he accepted young Travers\'s suggestion to go over to Jersey City\nand see a "go" between "Dutchy" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally\nknown as the Black Diamond.They covered up all signs of their evening\ndress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for\nthe smoke which surrounds a "go" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and\nthey also fastened their watches to both key-chains.Alf Alpin, who was\nacting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered\nat their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the\nplatform.The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that\nthe "two gents in high hats" had come in a carriage, and this and their\npatent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest.It was even\nwhispered that they were the "parties" who were putting up the money\nto back the Black Diamond against the "Hester Street Jackson."This in\nitself entitled them to respect.Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch,\nbut he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the\nsporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered\nwith diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should\nhold.It was two o\'clock before "Dutchy" Mack\'s backer threw the sponge\ninto the air, and three before they reached the city.They had another\nreporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely\nheld the watch in the face of several offers to "do for" him; and as\nVan Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get\nanything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman\'s invitation\nand went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl\'s Nest, Gus\nMcGowan\'s all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room\nof a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and tender.It was\ntoo late to go to bed, so they sat around the table, with their chairs\ntipped back and their knees against its edge.The two club men had\nthrown off their great-coats, and their wide shirt fronts and silk\nfacings shone grandly in the smoky light of the oil lamps and the\nred glow from the grill in the corner.They talked about the life the\nreporters led, and the Philistines asked foolish questions, which the\ngentleman of the press answered without showing them how foolish they\nwere."And I suppose you have all sorts of curious adventures," said Van\nBibber, tentatively."Well, no, not what I would call adventures," said one of the reporters."I have never seen anything that could not be explained or attributed\ndirectly to some known cause, such as crime or poverty or drink.You may\nthink at first that you have stumbled on something strange and romantic,\nbut it comes to nothing.You would suppose that in a great city like\nthis one would come across something that could not be explained away\nsomething mysterious or out of the common, like Stevenson\'s Suicide\nClub.Dickens once told James Payn that the\nmost curious thing he ever saw In his rambles around London was a ragged\nman who stood crouching under the window of a great house where the\nowner was giving a ball.While the man hid beneath a window on the\nground floor, a woman wonderfully dressed and very beautiful raised the\nsash from the inside and dropped her bouquet down into the man\'s hand,\nand he nodded and stuck it under his coat and ran off with it."I call that, now, a really curious thing to see.But I have never come\nacross anything like it, and I have been in every part of this big city,\nand at every hour of the night and morning, and I am not lacking in\nimagination either, but no captured maidens have ever beckoned to me\nfrom barred windows nor \'white hands waved from a passing hansom.\'Balzac and De Musset and Stevenson suggest that they have had such\nadventures, but they never come to me.It is all commonplace and vulgar,\nand always ends in a police court or with a \'found drowned\' in the North\nRiver."McGowan, who had fallen into a doze behind the bar, woke suddenly and\nshivered and rubbed his shirt-sleeves briskly.A woman knocked at the\nside door and begged for a drink "for the love of heaven," and the man\nwho tended the grill told her to be off.They could hear her feeling\nher way against the wall and cursing as she staggered out of the alley.Three men came in with a hack driver and wanted everybody to drink\nwith them, and became insolent when the gentlemen declined, and were\nin consequence hustled out one at a time by McGowan, who went to sleep\nagain immediately, with his head resting among the cigar boxes and\npyramids of glasses at the back of the bar, and snored."You see," said the reporter, "it is all like this.Night in a great\ncity is not picturesque and it is not theatrical.It is sodden,\nsometimes brutal, exciting enough until you get used to it, but it runs\nin a groove.It is dramatic, but the plot is old and the motives and\ncharacters always the same."The rumble of heavy market wagons and the rattle of milk carts told\nthem that it was morning, and as they opened the door the cold fresh\nair swept into the place and made them wrap their collars around\ntheir throats and stamp their feet.The morning wind swept down the\ncross-street from the East River and the lights of the street lamps and\nof the saloon looked old and tawdry.Travers and the reporter went off\nto a Turkish bath, and the gentleman who held the watch, and who had\nbeen asleep for the last hour, dropped into a nighthawk and told the\nman to drive home.It was almost clear now and very cold, and Van Bibber\ndetermined to walk.He had the strange feeling one gets when one stays\nup until the sun rises, of having lost a day somewhere, and the dance\nhe had attended a few hours before seemed to have come off long ago, and\nthe fight in Jersey City was far back in the past.The houses along the cross-street through which he walked were as dead\nas so many blank walls, and only here and there a lace curtain waved out\nof the open window where some honest citizen was sleeping.The street\nwas quite deserted; not even a cat or a policeman moved on it and Van\nBibber\'s footsteps sounded brisk on the sidewalk.There was a great\nhouse at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was\nwalking.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the\nbrown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door\nin this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it\nopened cautiously, and a man\'s head appeared in it for an instant and\nwas withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber\nstopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the\nstreet.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying\ninside dead, and the streets were still empty.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to\nfrighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of\nmust belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured\nhimself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would\nhave liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in\nadventure, in the wrong.So he approached the door silently, and jumped\nand caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of\nthe door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked\ncautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the\nonly noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had\nrested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to\nopen the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it\nheavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down\ndirectly on the other\'s head and shoulders.He could see the top of the\nman\'s head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he\nheld a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of\ndifferent sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below\nhad robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for\nhis having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his\ntreasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a\nfight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed\nby the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the\ntwo bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of\nsociety, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top\nof the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him\nand shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his\nmovements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped\nupon the man\'s head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk\nwith him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but\nbefore the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,\nVan Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his\nhand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly\nto where it lay and picked it up and said, "Now, if you try to get up\nI\'ll shoot at you."He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous\ninclination to add, "and I\'ll probably miss you," but subdued it.The\nburglar, much to Van Bibber\'s astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but\nsat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: "Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a\ndegree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined."Go ahead," reiterated the man, doggedly, "I won\'t move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening\nin his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down\nand ask the burglar to tell him all about it."You haven\'t got much heart," said Van Bibber, finally."You\'re a pretty\npoor sort of a burglar, I should say.""I won\'t go back--I won\'t go\nback there alive.I\'ve served my time forever in that hole.If I have to\ngo back again--s\'help me if I don\'t do for a keeper and die for it.But\nI won\'t serve there no more."asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; "to\nprison?"cried the man, hoarsely: "to a grave.Look at my face," he said, "and look at my hair.That ought to tell you\nwhere I\'ve been.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the\nlife out of my legs.I couldn\'t hurt you if\nI wanted to.I\'m a skeleton and a baby, I am.And\nnow you\'re going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty\nyears, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my\ntime so well and worked so hard."Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one\nhand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps\nof the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was\ndriving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold."I got out yesterday," said the man.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver."You didn\'t\nwaste much time," he said."No," answered the man, sullenly, "no, I didn\'t.I knew this place and\nI wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I\'d have to\nwait until I earned it, and I couldn\'t wait.I haven\'t seen my wife\nfor seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of\nthat--seven years.Seven years without\nseeing your wife or your child!And they\'re straight people, they are,"\nhe added, hastily."My wife moved West after I was put away and took\nanother name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join \'em,\nand I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now," he\nadded, dropping his face in his hands, "I\'ve got to go back.And I had\nmeant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!An\' I don\'t care whether you believe\nit or not neither," he added, fiercely."I didn\'t say whether I believed it or not," answered Van Bibber, with\ngrave consideration.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar\nlooked back at him, doggedly and defiantly, and with not the faintest\nsuggestion of hope in his eyes, or of appeal for mercy.Perhaps it was\nbecause of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved\nVan Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly."I\nsuppose, though," he said, as though speaking to himself, "that I ought\nto give you up.""I\'ll never go back alive," said the burglar, quietly."Well, that\'s bad, too," said Van Bibber."Of course I don\'t know\nwhether you\'re lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I\nvery much doubt it; but I\'ll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,\nand I\'ll see you on the train.And you can get off at the next station\nand rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw\nthose bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the\nmilkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your\npockets, and don\'t try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful\nlook at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he\nwas directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept\njust behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to\nwhat he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,\nbut he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived\nin the West, and who were "straight."asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window."Helena, Montana," answered the man with, for the first time, a look of\nrelief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar."I\nsuppose you know," he said, "that you can sell that at a place down town\nfor half the money.""Yes, I know that," said the burglar.There was a\nhalf-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the\nrestaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his\neyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave\nhim some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of\nthe station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and\nclerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and\ncrossed over to Delmonico\'s for his breakfast, and, while the waiter\nlaid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the\npapers.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance\non the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With\ngreater interest he read of the fight between "Dutchy" Mack and the\n"Black Diamond," and then he read carefully how "Abe" Hubbard, alias\n"Jimmie the Gent," a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had\nbeen traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van\nBibber breathed quickly as he read it."The detectives have a clew of\nhis whereabouts," the account said; "if he is still in the city they are\nconfident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who\nhelped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to\nget out West.""They may do that," murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim\ncontentment; "they probably will."Then he said to the waiter, "Oh, I don\'t know.Some bacon and eggs and\ngreen things and coffee."VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN\n\n\nYoung Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer\nabout the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found\nthe city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that\nhas been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the\ncountry.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,\nhe decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where\nsome one had told him you could get particular things particularly well\ncooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about\nthem, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling\nhorse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables\nwere unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in\na French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed\nthe awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late\nbreakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most\nremarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a\nyoung lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young\nman\'s back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth\nmoved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in\na most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed\nFrench hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly\nwell-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be\ndining alone with so young a man."It wasn\'t my fault," he heard the youth say earnestly."How could I\nknow he would be out of town?Your\ncousin is not the only clergyman in the city.""Of course not," said the girl, almost tearfully, "but they\'re not my\ncousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much\ndifferent."Runaway couple," commented Van Bibber.Read about\n\'em often; never seen \'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what\nfollowed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,\nand though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they\ndid not heed him nor lower their voices."Well, what are you going to do?"said the girl, severely but not\nunkindly."It doesn\'t seem to me that you are exactly rising to the\noccasion.""Well, I don\'t know," answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of\ntown now.You go on and eat something, and I\'ll get a directory and look\nup a lot of clergymen\'s addresses, and then we can make out a list and\ndrive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his\nvacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at\nfive this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River\nto-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.""They\'ll never forgive us," said the girl."Oh, well, that\'s all right," exclaimed the young man, cheerfully."Really, you\'re the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away\nwith.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing\nenough two days ago, and now you don\'t help me at all.he asked, and then added, "but please don\'t say so, even if you are.""No, not sorry, exactly," said the girl; "but, indeed, Ted, it is going\nto make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a\nbest man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish\nregistry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been\nat home to do the marrying."The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression\nof his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her\nhandkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he\nturned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van\nBibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston\nfamily named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who\nwas Van Bibber\'s particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual\nrecognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had\ndashed up the side street and was turning the corner."Standish," said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, "pay\nthis chap for these things, will you, and I\'ll get rid of your brother."Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish\ncame up them on a jump."Wait a minute; where are you\ngoing?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;\nthen I see you.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had\nseen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and\nthat they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were\nto depart for Chicago."The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said\nthey could not have left this place by the time I would reach it," said\nthe elder brother, doubtfully."That\'s so," said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously."I\nbrought \'em here not more\'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back\nto the depot."Yes, but they have," said Van Bibber."However, if you get over to\nJersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon\nas they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.""Thank you, old fellow," shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the\nmarriage, only too young, you know."Don\'t mention it," said Van Bibber, politely."Now, then," said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple\ntrembling on the terrace, "I\'ve sent your brother off to Chicago.I\ndo not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a\nhoneymoon.But I\'m not used to lying and I\'m not very good at it.Now,\nif you will introduce me, I\'ll see what can be done toward getting you\ntwo babes out of the woods."Standish said, "Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of\nwhom you have heard my brother speak," and Miss Cambridge said she\nwas very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying\ncircumstances."Now what you two want to do," said Van Bibber, addressing them as\nthough they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least\nforty, "is to give this thing all the publicity you can."chorused the two runaways, in violent protest."You were about to make a fatal mistake.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,\nwho would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or\na witness, just like any eloping farmer\'s daughter and lightning-rod\nagent.Why you were not married\nrespectably in church I don\'t know, and I do not intend to ask, but\na kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor\nscandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names\ninto all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and\nyou will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just\nrely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It\'s all going to\ncome out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially\ngood."Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,\nwhere he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have\nthe church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a\ndistrict-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o\'clock."And now," he soliloquized, "I must get some names.It doesn\'t matter\nmuch whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,\nbut they must be names that everybody knows.Whoever is in town will be\nlunching at Delmonico\'s, and the men will be at the clubs."So he first\nwent to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found\nMrs."Regy" Van Arnt and Mrs."Jack" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,\nwho had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the\nBoston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to\nsecrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom\neverybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly\ninvited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told\nthem that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then\nhe sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall\nRiver boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs."Regy" Van\nArnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got\ninto another cab and carried off the groom."I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now," said Van\nBibber, as they drove to the church, "and this is the first time I ever\nappeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge\nyachting suit.But then," he added, contentedly, "you ought to see the\nother fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.""Regy" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but\nthe bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her\nprospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of\nthe men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he\nhad ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and\nthe assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men\ninsisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the\nabsence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a\nhandful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at\nthe club--after them as they drove off to the boat."Now," said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, "I\nwill send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will\nread like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of\nthe season.And yet I can\'t help thinking--"\n\n"Well?""Regy," as he paused doubtfully."Well, I can\'t help thinking," continued Van Bibber, "of Standish\'s\nolder brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the\nshade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows," he\nadded, mournfully, "that when a man is not practised in lying, he should\nleave it alone."asked Ames, as the man\nentered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the\nexchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them\nhurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his\napproval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he\nwished to trade that morning."What\'s your reason for thinking I ought\nto buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied\nHodson.Ames studied the broker\'s face a moment.Then his own brightened, as\nhe began to divine the man\'s reason.he ejaculated, "you\nthink there\'s quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames\nquickly.Then--"I\'m going to attend a meeting of the Council of\nAmerican Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside\nthe door."Ames concluded, "I guess that\'s all.I\'m at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock\nExchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector\'s at twelve sharp, returning\nhere immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various\ncommissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning\'s quota of letters\nand messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the\ntelephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly\ndictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want\nto see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,\n"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers\' Union called at the\nearliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the\nnight with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain\nMcCall.Here is a bundle of\nrequests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,\nand various homes.\'Phone to the\nCity Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go\nover my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once\nto foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim\ndoes his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank\nits note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had\ncompleted the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous\nmixture of hypocrisy and greed.I\'ve thrown another hook into him\nnow."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his\nelevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the\ndirectors\' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his\nassociates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the\nmeeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then\nAmes announced:\n\n"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty\nmillions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take\nthem at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and\nthe bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold\nat a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred\nthousand.Now let me suggest that the\npsychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a\ndrug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a\ndollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until\nsomebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the\nnumber of those who covet the article and scramble for it will\nincrease proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,\n"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the\nPresident in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next\nThursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we\nhad better give him a little lesson to take out of office with\nhim--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our\nbank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his\nluncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the\nprivate interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then\nfollowed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and\nmonthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,\nfinancial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further\ndiscussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of\ncable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his\nheads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,\nto listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,\ndecisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning\nuntil, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private\nelevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the\nsuperenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,\nand his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless\nendeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can\nbut point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting\nhis already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a\nfortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and\nwhich Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the\nfortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but\ncontinually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,\namassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire\nwith the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven\nhastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited\nas his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed\nhimself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and\nspend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently\non the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the\nbeautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well\nbeyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of\ndust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite\nSpirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove\ntheir doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13\n\n\nThe _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,\nand its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark\nwaters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the\ndeep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a\nspirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a\nchannel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew\na swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off\non either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to\nhis fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the\ncrackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible\nhands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were\nborne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time\nto time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the\nluxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut\nglass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent\nof white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the\nmovements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the\ncold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn\'t get results that are in any way commensurate with its\ninvestment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and\ncents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I\ntake off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of\noperating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in\ntalking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just\nwhat interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was\nclearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the\ncigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing\nover his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes\never foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable\nKlondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I\'d\nconsider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you\ndo not know your Bible."I don\'t suppose I ever in my life read a whole\nchapter in the book.I can\'t swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly\nunreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we\nknow and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any\nuse for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,\ntangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant\nchurches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many\ninterpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently\ninterested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when\nhard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to\noffer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of\nthe thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself\nto keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he\ndoesn\'t know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I\ndrop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and\ngo away with the feeling that I didn\'t get my money\'s worth.From a\nbusiness point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about\ntwenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of\nsleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and\nseventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your\nceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering\nflocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he\nsaid with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude\ntoward us.We are really more spiritual--"\n\nAmes interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your\nChurch as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary\nand merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the\nsame business, that of making money!And I\'d like to borrow some of\nyour methods.Only, you\'ve got it over me, for you\nhurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling\npublic; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have\nto hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that\nmight end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful\nfriendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay\nfor these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their\nlike."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he\nsaid, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are\ngrown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost\nme about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door\nin New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot\nwhere such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling\nchampagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"\nreplied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And\ndoes your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and\nCeylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I\'m now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without\ndoubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it\nnever gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and\ndestiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted\nthat I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that\nno so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is\nfear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your\nchurchly system.I know that as long as a\nbusiness opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is\nat the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,\nI know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business\nworld.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,\nreligious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you\ngreatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I\nknow of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one\nhundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few\nshares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn\'t know about it," he said.I didn\'t own a dollar\'s worth of South Ohio.Oh,\nyes," he added, as he saw Lafelle\'s eyes widening in surprise, "I\npushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,\nthought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden\ndiscovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed\nlike a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn\'t have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was\nAmerican nerve, that\'s all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you\'d\nhave been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I\'d have\nbeen made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to\nset in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the\nwhiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury\nof their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage\nand cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with\nthe gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the\nsmoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which\nwere various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,\nwhat is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of\nestablishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore\nplunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to\nhave great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I\nask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the\nimmigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the\ninterests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he\nintended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for\nfavors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to\nimpugn my own patriotism!""I don\'t quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with\nunrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the\nProtestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law\nand force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all\nreligions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to\namendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you\nProtestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,\none would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a\nmenace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop\nto realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your\nown country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but\nfor her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing\nto-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,\na thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were\nHindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of\nRoman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the\nirate churchman\'s arm."And please do not class me with the\nProtestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made\nadmirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments\nhave netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in\nand about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church\nisn\'t in politics.Meantime, his brain was working\nrapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the\nconversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way\nback to mediaeval times.Can\'t you dig up some old provision whereby I\ncan block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If\nyou can, I\'ll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious\nimmigration bill that\'s introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on\nto express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,\nbroker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the\nidea\'s a corker!""From a book entitled \'Confessions of a Roman\nCatholic Priest,\' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young\nattache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _\'en manos muertas\'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly\nsystem!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I\'ll\nhave the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message\nwill go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you\'ve got influence at\nwork in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the\nprospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I\nretire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the\nadmiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused\nin me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up\nthere are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed\nin the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the\nceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as\nto be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong\nelectric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait\nsimilar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,\nwistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the\neffect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am\nsure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I\nam certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have\nknown the original?""I assure you I never had that\npleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the\ndesigner of the yacht.Adds much to the\ngeneral effect, don\'t you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to\nthat one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn\nthe identity of the original for me.It\'s quite interesting to feel\nthat one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty\nhanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady\nis--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman\'s face.But--that picture\nhas haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of \'Storrs and Crafts,\'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that\nmoment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,\nMonsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message\nfor his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,\nand thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he\nextinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which\nilluminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in\nfront of the one which had stirred Lafelle\'s query, he sat before it\nfar into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad\nfeatures of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes\nmurmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he\nwould erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and\nworn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14\n\n\nAlmost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad\nCarmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst\nof the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about\nsuch an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the\nreaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,\noperating through the types of mind among which her life had been\ncast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the\ninsane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society\nrivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious\nentertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to\nsocial leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the\nshallow woman\'s grasp.she knew not that when her itching\nfingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she\nhad long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls\nhad ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the\nfirst of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as\nupon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred\ndollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had\nrejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from\nspecially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It\nwas true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been\nconscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the\ngorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering\nskirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at\nthe rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,\nand fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while\nanticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would\nproduce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty\ndevotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen\'s\n_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her\nrival\'s in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the\nwinter\'s social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly\npresented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that\nMrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,\nlest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat\nchastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make\ncalculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and\nfifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed\nthat her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand\ndollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly\ndressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly\ninadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five\nthousand.Could she maintain her\ncity home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,\nand spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to\ndraw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some\nmillionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only\nterminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be\ndevised at once.That obscure, retiring\nwoman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a\nword of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would\nexpand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a\nmember of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,\nwhen the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,\nthe Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the\nwoman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she\nthought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow\nfalling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen\'s hold on the strange, tarnished\nwoman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she\nagain sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen\'s\nforthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she\nbrought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden\nof the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of\ninterest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not\nonly did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income\nmight be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it\nutterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever\namount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen\'s social\nconquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself\nwas acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and\nwas buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world\nfinance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not\npromoting a company in which her sister\'s husband, and the girl\nherself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for\na magnate of Ames\'s standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of\nthis before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in\nthis new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a\nfortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the\nBeaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that\nsecurity alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when\nyour father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and\nI can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I\nnot?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this\nself-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent\nof a single day\'s food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of\nthe tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such\n_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely\nillustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance\nof expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and\nupon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred\nfashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less\nthan ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen\'s rich\nvoice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly\nswept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which\nMrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,\nbecame a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that\ngarish display of worldliness to voice her soul\'s purity, its\nwonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this\nhighest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered\ndenunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the\npresent mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even\nthat of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen\'s shoulder, and went\nhome vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap\nof Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their\nfulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter\nKathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and\nchagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the\nclose of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she\nwas grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own\nfeeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl\nfrom Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character\nof the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,\nthat she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless\nefforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the\nvulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege\nwhich she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare\nideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her\npassionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might\nsee and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and\nher fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were\nliterally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event\nin the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor\nchild found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her\nattire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be\nwhisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl\nthat she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions\nmust be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her\ntight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of\nher tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;\nand her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped\nfor air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the\nvacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing\ncompletely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found\nno time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as\nwas indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid\nsociety happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent\ndivorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she\ndrew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of\nsociety revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give\nfull vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as\nshe sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music\nroom, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can\nthey!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,\ndearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and\ndream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from\nwhom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because\nof the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily\nadmitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The\nSouth American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her\nblase sister--had completely captured New York\'s conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained\nwith a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness\nof critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused\nexpressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers\nwere full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl\'s social\nprestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to\nthe social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held\nmany a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien\'s dinner\nguests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in\nfull progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the\nsuccesses of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in\nEngland; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I\nshall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a\nlittle matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become\nnicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is\na beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim\'s mining\ncompany in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim\'s engineer, Harris,\nhas returned to the States.Couldn\'t get up the Magdalena river, on\naccount of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year\nyet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I\nnow hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles\'s notes to the amount of two hundred and\nfifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to\nturn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her\ncheek.I\'ll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the\nway, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles\nanother avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare\nshrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center\nbox in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy\ngarden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,\nwith her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge\nbroadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were\nranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and\npatent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade\nplungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,\nall under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the\nAmes family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of\nAltern and her son.Ames was smiling\nand affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of\nthe Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth\nof twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,\nas he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh\nyoung girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I\'ve heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that\nharmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven\'t had an\nopportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at\nher.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and\na smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her\nfrank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into\nhis face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take\nhis eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he\nlaughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language\na bit.We\'ll have to get together often, so\'s I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the\nfirst time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso\'s in fine voice\nto-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed\nunder his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the\ndirection of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the\nman\'s keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,\ncutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and\nstudied the operas that were produced on the boards before her\nwondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And\ngenerally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the\nchair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one\nevening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,\nlike most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human\nlife.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for\nits setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a\ndepiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be\npermitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified\nto remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood\nscenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests\nin ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he\nhazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered\nhimself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and\nsettled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern\nwriter, \'true lo life.\'True to the horrible, human sense of life,\nthat looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,\nI admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here\nto-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed\nsuffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we\nmust put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_\nlife, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,\neven in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us\nthe awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better\nexistence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton\nmurder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing\ntheir words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not\nto do, don\'t you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he\nset before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may\nsee what not to carve?""And we who would transform the\nhuman sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a\nperfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You\ndon\'t see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and\nthe world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern\nreality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will\nturn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which\nwill excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for\npurity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and\ntrue guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this\nconversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the\nfutility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,\nturned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of\nintelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the\nHawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a\ngorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,\nwhose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a\nmountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the\nexit.protested the youth, with a vain show\nof resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out\nof the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew\nhad vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the\nsituation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering\ndire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames\'s manner unconsciously assumed an air of\npatronage."This is the first real opportunity I\'ve had to talk with\nyou.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have\nthawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have\nbegun to make mental notes.But they\nare not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few\nmonths I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was\nsomewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud\nwords; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic\nendeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not\nknow where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he\nis going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and\nhe must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he\nmust do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before\nhis little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I\nsometimes think that people here are trying to get away from\nthemselves, but they don\'t know it.I think they come to the opera\nbecause they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget\nthemselves for a few moments, don\'t you?"well, I can\'t say," was Ames\'s meaningless reply, as he sat\nregarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least\npretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most\nforcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in\nyour government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,\nin particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of\nsects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,\nhundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing\nconcepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass\nthat, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he\nwould be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that\'s so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such\nconversation."But we solid business men have found that religious\nemotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man\neffeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn\'t have a man\nin my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"\n\n"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature\never written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as\nthe greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent\nchannels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest\nwhatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was\nsomething in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by\nwhat anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,\nmediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought\nbroke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely\nforced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to\nhis lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you\nknow," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,\nso soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy\nbulk of his own.He felt it, felt\nhimself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful\nfeatures, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had\nat first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was\nseeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all\nthat--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,\nuntouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to\nherself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She\narched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I\'ll tell you what it is this year," he sagely\nreplied.He gave a sententious nod of\nhis head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season\'s innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable\ndeceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her\nchair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he\nwhispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can\'t\nyou manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention\nagain to the stage.A business\nassociate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles\ndismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the\nplay.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the\npuppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and\nthe tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing\nsighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare\nbefore her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the\ngrim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he\nled her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita\'s blind, helpless\nbabe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled\nwith a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands\nand wept softly.CHAPTER 15\n\n"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,\nher eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into\nthat strange woman\'s arms and poured out her heart\'s surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the\ngirl."I don\'t understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don\'t know God--they don\'t know what love is--they don\'t know\nanything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with\nthem I gasp, I choke--"\n\n"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she\nstroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the \'four hundred\' are suffering from the\nsame disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien\ntogether seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman\nherself.And both acknowledged it, nor\nwould have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic\nconfidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman\'s\npast or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which\nshe sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus\nmust have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,\nsoiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance\nof the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of\nlove, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul\ninto a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,\non the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her\nslowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily\ncloser about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into\nher empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always\nto address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of\nconfidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest\nabout real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men\nlaughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have\nhelped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed\ntheir lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my\nmessage"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message\nof love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so\nlow and degraded.They don\'t\nknow what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"\n\nThe Beaubien\'s jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep\nmy views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I\nmust marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and\nthen shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and\nspeak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was\ndragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received\nJim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he\nwas able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they\nlittle realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you\ncame to me.There, I didn\'t mean to let those tears get away from\nme."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity\nBall."A look of pain swept over the girl\'s face.The Beaubien bent and\nkissed her."You will not leave society\nvoluntarily.They\nwill light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from\ntheir doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,\n"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the\nHorse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless\nreceptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings\ninterspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an\nexpert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the\nwonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the\nworldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social\nswath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and\nmarched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without\ninterference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of\nthe first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself\nin matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was\nactively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes\nwhich the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her\nprincipal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over\nthe large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,\nat the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly\npious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president\nof that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one\nday, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into\nthe library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of\nher thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have\nany claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of\nyour six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others\nrelating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you\ntransfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,\nI give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as\npart payment for the great expense to which I have been put in\nintroducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is\nmerely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our\nfamily, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes\nall liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business\nmatters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,\nin view of what I have done for you, don\'t you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her\nclaim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the\ngood woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of\nrich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the\nBeaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the\ntidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of\nfinance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from\nCartagena.But the\nBeaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was\nfar from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted\nbitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function\nof its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The\nnewspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and\npredictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in\ntheir vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative\neffects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of\n"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even\nclosely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value\nmounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric\nspark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the\nnobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great\npeople whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who\nare wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their\nmaterial vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the\nguise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving\nthought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand\ndollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had\nwaited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various\nnewspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did\nshe give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she\ndid--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca\nprincess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles\nknew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American\ngirl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the\nlast moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a\nseason unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had\npreviously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for\nCarmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,\nlearning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly\nannounced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city\'s leading man of\nfinance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with\ntheir full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so\nit was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,\nwho, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers\nin ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,\nerstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as\nhe settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments\nand exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of\nwitnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of\ncharity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his\nintention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her\npreviously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the\nHawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the\nyoung girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically\nobdurate.For the angry\nBeaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her\nabundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her\ndenunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of\nwhich she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously\nkissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes\nof the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned\nto the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of\nthe great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the\nmultitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The\ngigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of\npotential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His\nmassive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of\ncomment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his\nstrong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle\nuplifting of a tiger\'s paw--behind it lay all that was humanly\nterrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His\nthick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great\nhead like a lion\'s mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back\nover the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender\nwisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don\'t know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she\nbelongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a\nslender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,\ngliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,\nall in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist\nshe wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no\ncomment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,\nuplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her\nrich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light\nthat fell in torrents upon it.There\'s a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his\nlong neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no\nfurther taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won\nfor herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into\na marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff\nwhite tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was\nof heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade\nof pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a\nlarge rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,\none bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation\nof emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond\ncoronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true\nto her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames\nand had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart\nset.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her\nthick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,\nthe gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each\nhigh, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body\ncurved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the\nmass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he\nmurmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And\nthen, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized\nwho he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The\nbig-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant\ncorridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables\nbeyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from\nfrosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and\nglittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and\ncare-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and\nsparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with\ntheir leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter\nblasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less\nunreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found\nexpression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I\'d get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her\nwretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as\nshe stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her\nfeet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran\nout and seized her."I say, Jude, ain\'t ye goin\' in?Git arrested--ye\'d spend the night in\na warm cell, an\' that\'s better\'n our bunk, ain\'t it?""I\'m goin\' to French Lucy\'s," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye\'ve lost yer looks, Jude, an\' ol\' Lucy ain\'t a-goin\' to take\nye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we\'ll go down to\nMike\'s place, an\' then come back here when it\'s out, and ye kin pinch\na string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening\nto the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough\nviolently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved\naway into the night.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,\nsecured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led\nCarmen.Ever see\nanything like this in Simiti?"She was\nglad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and\nfrom the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke\nof Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn\'t know there were such things\nin the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I\'ll wager there\'s millions of dollars\'\nworth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the\nmoney to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"\n\n"Oh, I see.No, it\'s the money derived from the sale of\ntickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren\'t you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual\ntone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,\nspeculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:\n\n"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you\npeople by your charity, such as this, only make more charity\nnecessary.Why don\'t you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that\'s quite impossible, you know.\'The poor\nye have always with you\', eh?She was\ndeeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in\nall."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your\nBible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the\nthought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested\noutwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don\'t you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the\npoverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from\nGod, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don\'t know anything about God.As\nfor you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like\ndeath, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that\'s good news!Then there is\nno such thing as \'the survival of the fittest,\' and the weak needn\'t\nnecessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that\nyou have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not\ngenerally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there\nbeside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He\nreached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then\ntake it away from them again.All the money which these rich people\nhere to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is\njust a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example\nwhich makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don\'t you think\nyou are assuming a great deal?I\'m sure I\'m not half so bad as you\npaint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from\nsome source, hasn\'t it?And you manipulate the stock market and put\nthrough wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take\ntheir money from them!But your idea of charity makes\nme pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by\nstifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and\nlegalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,\nand so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot\nabout such things!I\'ve been studying and thinking a great deal since\nI came to the United States."And there was a touch of\naspersion in his voice."I\'ve come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don\'t join the\nranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages\ndo.I can tear down as easily as you or\nanybody else.But to build something better is entirely another\nmatter.""Well, what is it, if I may\nask?"Well, perhaps that\'s so," he said, bending toward her and\nagain attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don\'t know what love\nis, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you\'ll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory\nfinger."I\'m yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just\nas much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any\nprinciple, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her\nglowing face.I\nwonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a\nprincess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might\nbe your prince."But then her bright\nsmile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I\'ll send him a challenge\nto-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can\'t.And,\noh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of\nthe war."This innocent girl little knew that one of\nthe instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a\nnew thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this\npriest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of\nthe revolution!And who, according to a\nrecent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--\n\n"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the\ntruth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself\nfree; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his\nproblem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking\noff into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I\nam--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped\nto a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a\nsharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none\nother!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should\nrot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are\ngoing to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"\n\n"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to\nhimself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she\nmurmured."Perhaps you won\'t go on piling up big mountains of money\nthat you can\'t use, and that you won\'t let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your\nempire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such\nempires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her\ndown by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced\nreformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be\nsurmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think\nnot so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do\nyou suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue\nwith us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you\nare--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid\nsuccess, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And\nthen, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your\ncharities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,\nmeantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the\nexpense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the\npoor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It\'s like a circle,\nisn\'t it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you\nknow."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with\nthe lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that\'s so," he began."But of\ncourse you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and\nthat world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can\'t reform all\nin a minute, can we?""I don\'t know how fast you might reform if you\nreally, sincerely tried.And if\nyou, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities\nin the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I\'m sure\nyou\'d make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting\nsuch a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then\nhe took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of\nit--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would\nyou mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging\nheartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to \'acquire that\nmind which was in Christ Jesus.\'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to\nanger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something\nakin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man\'s emotions\nas he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The\npoisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against\nthe shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to\nconfound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the\nconviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had\ndrawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had\nstolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer\nwinds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to\nknow that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those\nthings which the world will not accept, because it thinks them\nmiracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will\ndestroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the\ntrue sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into\ncaptivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at\nevil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade\naway before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there\nisn\'t anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *\n\nHow long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the\nman suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright\nlittle image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an\' when they begins to come out to their gasoline\ncarts grab anything ye can, an\' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched\nback against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would\nsoon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler\'s window chimed the hour\nof four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and\nloudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically\nhappy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,\nappeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had\ncalled Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the\ngirl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The\nglare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl\ntore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude\'s\nhand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the\nstreet.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her\nstupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her\ncomposure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes\nand tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was\nred with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she\nexclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before\nher, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in\naddition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And\nthis unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would\nbelieve your story if it should get out?"The worried woman\'s face was\nbathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed\nCarmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have\nthings that I don\'t need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the\nstormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a\nsuggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the\nnewspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren\'t stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"\n\n"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her\nendurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair\nto any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded\nwig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set\nit tottering.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that\nshe was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most\nrelentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now\ndethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,\nmysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the\nsulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot\nslip, and that her own husband\'s conduct in leading the grand march\nwith Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige\nwhich for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we\'ll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected\nKathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they\'ve\neven broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry\ntheft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her\nstring of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames\'s lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca\nprincess, indeed!Why doesn\'t\nsomebody take the trouble to investigate her?They\'d probably find her\nan outcast.""Couldn\'t papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after\nthe affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,\nshe would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her\nconsort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each\nother but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for\nthe sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in\na strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no\nmention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental\nroof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly\nunder the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to\nhis mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to\nbuttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in\ndetermining Carmen\'s status, there was none to be obtained from him,\nstrongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself\nto be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to\nfar unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied\nirrelevantly to Kathleen\'s question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,\nwho sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites\nred-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he\'s the most\nwonderful he\'s ever seen, and I\'m going to have him and a real Hindu\n_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York\'s conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for\nthe social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new\ndiversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of\nthat gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his\ncunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable\nantics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled\ncourt, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was\nwhat he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who\ntoils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the\ngreat mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of\nreason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of\nthe golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite\nunendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff\nchampagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men\nwith glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and\nentertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames\nmansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the\nnewspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to\nbulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he\ncaused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit\ncloser to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a\nshade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still\nrunning true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French\n_Bal de l\'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had\nfurnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue\nto lend her money and take her notes?I don\'t--I don\'t seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still\nhate her?At any rate I\'m glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from\nher place.It\'s worth all I\'ve spent, even if I burn the notes I hold\nagainst Jim Crowles\'s widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,\nshe would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I\'m not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,\nGod bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l\'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of\nthe smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing\nflowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her\ngreat natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the\nfairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a\nlong carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily\ngirthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every\nstep as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon\nthe graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she\nwould have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so\nwildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen\'s further\ntriumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end\nof the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon\nit.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and\nout through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton\nAmes, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a\nblood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the\nplatform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in\n"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily\nrose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb\nwhich alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he\nreached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended\nhis enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial\nobligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to\ngo," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known\nnothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture\nstalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he\napproached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile\nwreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,\nblack wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy\nupon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the\nfair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the\norchestra crashed, the vulture\'s wings slowly opened, and the girl,\nwho would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,\nstepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,\nback to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared\nthrough the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl\'s done for; and Ames has taken this\nway to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It\nwas the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of\nthe West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached\nCarmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with\ntwo superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over\nCarmen\'s hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven\'t got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating\nvivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from\nCartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious\ninquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for\ngetting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the\nlittle town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut\noff from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into\nher eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now\nrecovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your\nsocial projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed\nto me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters\ncertainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have\nall but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman\nwith wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,\nsince you united with the true Church?""Are you not\nat last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of\nunalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still\nremain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness\nto the Church?""Why--"\n\nIt was now Lafelle\'s turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to\nMrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the\nladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social\nheight.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly\nthought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged\nhis shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now\ntoo deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle\'s control over\nher was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the\ncurtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible\nvoice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,\nmay I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her\nmuch of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with\nemphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express\nthe hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,\n"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her\nchair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear\nfriend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She\ncertainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to\nlead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the\neagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of\nMrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your\nbeautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady\ninterpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as\nshe bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I\nwas deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I\'m jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him\nappear still more ridiculous."It\'s nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It\'s a bally bore to have a\nregular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I\njust made up my mind I wouldn\'t stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward\nthe refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of\ngratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which\nhe had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this\n_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat\nsome minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you\'re deucedly clevah,\nMiss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that\nfrom the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,\ndon\'t ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant\nSimiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It\'s--it\'s romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis\nto his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a\npocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell\nanother who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye\nknow, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right\noff that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you\nwere the minute we clapped eyes on you.That\'s because we belong to\nthe nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I\'m going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont\'s filly; but, bah Jove, I\nsay, I\'m going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You\'re a princess, ye know,\nand so you\'re in our class.I\'m not one of the kind that hands out a\ntitle to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to\nget her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It\'s all right for you to have money, of course.I won\'t marry a\npauper, even if she\'s a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just\nsuited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I\'ve got\nthirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a\nmoment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of\nlevity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock\nseriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"\n\n"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can\'t you see that, by\nmarrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don\'t\nunderstand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we\'ve simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they\nmarry.I haven\'t heard a word of that from you."It was\nlove that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don\'t love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is\nwith the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can\'t talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I\'m offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,\nthough you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now\nrelinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not\nwish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack\nof comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing\nhim, a duke?"A--a--I don\'t get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let\'s not talk about\nthis any more.I do love you, Reginald,\nbut not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;\nnot the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of\nAltern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than\nif I married you!"I--I expected we\'d be engaged--I told mother--"\n\n"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little\nproblem that has presented itself to you.And I will help\nyou to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I\ndidn\'t mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We\'re just awfully good friends, aren\'t we?And I do\nlove you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the\nvery conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense\nof nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some\nmoments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to\nflood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at\nCarmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess\nof Altern?Carmen\'s spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal\nboredom of this blustering dame\'s society gabble.Gannette hooked\nher arm into the girl\'s and led her to a divan."It\'s a great affair,\nisn\'t it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the\nseat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when\nI got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn\'t get through\nthe door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like\nthat he\'d get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with\nthe expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn\'t his threat that hindered me,\ngoodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years\nwith him!Speaking of divorce,\nhe\'s just got one.Billy Patterson\ndared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having\na little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the\ndare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of\nfifty thousand per.Why, he has a\npractice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of\nhis ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He\'s simply in with the\nwealthy, that\'s all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated\nalone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I\'d like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman\'s mute\nappeal for sympathy."She\'s going to be\ndropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is\nbeing handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won\'t be\nmuch left when it\'s settled--\n\n"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and\nfull in the back so\'s to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear\ntogs cut that way--\n\n"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that\nnext season\'s styles will be very ultra.Hats\nsmall and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets\nvery full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so\'s to give the\nappearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts\nplaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together\nagain at the ankle, so\'s to look like the body of a butterfly.Then\nbutterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she\nlamented, "I\'d give anything if I had a decent shape!I\'d like to wear\nthose shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I\'d look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can\nwear those X-ray dresses all right--\n\n"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just\nbelow.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale\nwoman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as\nthe loquacious Mrs.But that\ngenial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I\'m _so_ glad you\'re going to marry young Altern," she said, again\nswerving the course of her conversation."He\'s got a fine old ruined\ncastle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I\nhear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you\'ll do a lot for his family.You know--but\ndon\'t breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized\nsocially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a\nwhile Ames backed her, but it wouldn\'t do.His millions couldn\'t buy\nher the court entree, and she just had to quit.That\'s why she\'s over\nhere now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of\nyears ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before\nand since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the\nheavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to\nentertainments.You\'re\na princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you\'re expected to do for the Altern crowd--\n\n"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another\ntheme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"\n\nCarmen\'s patience had touched its limit.she\nbegged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal\'s about Ames\'s son, you know.The\nreason he doesn\'t go in society.You see--"\n\n"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching\nsmile."You wouldn\'t deliberately give me poison to drink, would\nyou?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is\ndeadly poisonous, don\'t you know it?""You don\'t mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you\nonly understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering\none\'s mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of\ndisease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in\ndiscordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don\'t\nwant any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as\nwell hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly\nconversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal\nthings which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor\nshould you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the\nthought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one\'s thought--that alone is one\'s claim to _real_\naristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to\nlet you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with\nthe crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found\nherself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had\nbeen one of the objects of Mrs.The\nwoman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder\ncame into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk\nall we want to, with nobody to overhear.she\nabruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued\nmutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven\'t anything but money.That\nis why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"\nshe added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,\nfirst thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in\nstubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17\n\n\nOn the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles\'s very successful\nimitation of the _Bal de l\'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early\ncall to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit\nof sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the\nchurchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:\n\n"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but\non the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated\nwith, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to\nyou, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early\nsummer.Ketchim\'s engineers will\nmake any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you\ntell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if\nI can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will\nhand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and\ngave himself up to a moment\'s reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I\nwonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn\'t show\nme?I\'m going to drop him after this trap is\nsprung.He\'s got Jim Crowles\'s widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I\'ll--"\n\nHe was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your\nwife last evening?I don\'t believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I\ndon\'t think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever\nintended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,\nnot in a thousand years!--Yes, I\'ll back her!And if your society\nisn\'t good enough for her--and I don\'t think it is--why, I\'ll form\na little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"\nhe commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile\nalready has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan\nspeculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And\nI\'ve bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a\nmillion--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She\'ll\nfeed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So\nis C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don\'t like\nthe way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it\ncan\'t last much longer.And then--then--"\n\nHis thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon\nis--well!But--where on earth did\nthat girl come from?There\'s a lot of experience coming to\nher.And then she\'ll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but\nLucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nMonsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him\nwhen his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the\nhouse during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that\na slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the\ncontemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the \'phone, "one who\nknows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good\nis ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected\ncall of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously\nwelcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,\nMonsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a\npresence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved\nCarmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of\nvastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,\nis not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the\nothers--"\n\n"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their\npresent whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have\ncome to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the\nChurch.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace\nwith us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by\nrace, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come\nto invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of\nRome.Hawley-Crowles, is one\nof us.And you, my\ndaughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable\nmission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite\nnecessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that\nthey will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation\noutside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you\nprove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any\nbut a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of\nmateriality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of\nthe Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very\nsimple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your\npenance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not\nready to voice them.Carmen went on:\n\n"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every\none work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any\nhindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every\none, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has\ndirected.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On\nthe contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of\nthe Church.Beginning nineteen\ncenturies ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the\nworld\'s morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that\ntime changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His\nChrist.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called\nChristian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one\nanother over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories\nupon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious\nhistory!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The\nresult which you have just cited proves conclusively that the\nScriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is\nperfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of\nan infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual\nFathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the\npresent Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to\nhis feet."Jesus said: \'He that believeth on\nme, the works that I do shall he do also.\'I am going to take you over\nto the home of old Maggie, our cook\'s mother.You will\nheal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn\'t she a doctor?""Yes, but he can\'t help her.You should be able to do the works\nwhich he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and\nblood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to\ncure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as\nthat!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were\nsummoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it\nwouldn\'t make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for\nthe repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the\ngreat works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of\ndeath?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do\nmuch after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the\npoor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as\nremarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a\ngreat truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign\nwhich the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such\ninstances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately\nhealed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced\nfor ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality\nof evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If\nyou did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things\nwould be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in\nwhich to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie\'s\nwith me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that\nthe Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl\'s voice waxed stronger while she delivered this\npolemic.Slowly the churchman\'s face darkened, as he moved backward\nand sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling\nas she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the\nscolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of\nChrist need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,\nwhether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does\nnot blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to\nmake any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man\'s face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if\nyou consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by\nthat adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew\nno evil.I could not see sickness or\ndeath as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful\nclearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the\noperation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick\nwere healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my\nbeloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to\nkeep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest\npadre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so\nconstantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the\nspirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate\nupon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the\ngreatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie\nas its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the\nunreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth\nwhich Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of\nhis people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am\nnow striving to acquire \'that mind,\' that spiritual consciousness,\nwhich was in him.I have been\nwonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,\nas he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never\nreally been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your\nChurch and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very\ninadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of\nSaints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,\nbrightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she\nsaid, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn\nauthority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if\nyour Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing\nmore than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the\ngrave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between\nus."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment\'s silence, "you see, do\nyou not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all\nevil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over\nevery physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have\nsuch power?No, he meant that every\none who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of\nthought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself\nof false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,\neven to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by\nthe belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing\nof the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can\'t you, a\nchurchman, see it?And can\'t you see how shallow your views are?Don\'t\nyou know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,\nmaterial concept, and therefore a part of the \'one lie\' about God, who\nis Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in\nrebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent\ndeeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise\nfrom men.Hawley-Crowles\'s elevation to social\nleadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church\nafforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if\never, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in\nSimiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always\nbestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my\nGod, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful\nto Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held\nhis gaze fixed upon the girl\'s bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew\nthat the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that\nthreaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a\nsmile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by\nfear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have\nsought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is\npowerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible\nallegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived\nAdam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as\nyou admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, \'God hath not given us\nthe spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to\nthreatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the\nyoung girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted\nwith years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly\nhandsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost\nwraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though\nuntutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious\nrepresentative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far\nback through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who\nput their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they\nwove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the\nboundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there\nsurged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in\nhis arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare\nspirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died\nwithin him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in\nhis hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,\ntaking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,\nlooking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then\nimmediately left the house.CHAPTER 18\n\nMonsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint\nof certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl\nawoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was\nattracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young\npriest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught\nsight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot\nall else in her absorption in the closing words:\n\n  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little\n  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead\n  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God\n  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl\'s hands to the floor.Her eyes,\nbig and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the\nblind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed\nride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the\ncar and made her preparations."We\'ll go over to his church," she said\naloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the\naddress of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn\'t it just\nwonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to\nthe distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn\'t ask\nme any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn\'t like to have me talk\nabout certain things, and so I can\'t tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance\ndisarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I\'m a\nmissionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching\nin the name of Christianity.I\'ll tell you all about it some day.Now\ntell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor\nkey?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived\nnowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you\nare on the wrong track, doesn\'t it?""I\'m tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank\nback into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not\nknow what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don\'t mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the\nwoman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I\'ve had that stuff\npreached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an\nemotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"\n\n"Who\'s he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"\n\n"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk\nreligion?""Well," she responded, "I\'ve had a good deal\nto do with both.""Tell me something about your\nlife," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;\nI will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I\nlived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,\nlisten, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the\nenthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off\nGuamoco.As she listened, the woman\'s eyes grew wide with interest.At times\nshe voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl\nconcluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look\nof mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all\nthat, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in\nthat awful war!"Don\'t you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at\nher."And--you don\'t want to know what it was that kept me through it all,\nand that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so\neagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her\ncompanion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest\nyou are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took\nme to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little\nchurch edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a\nmodest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man\'s eyes.Then he\nstepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had\npassed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly\nto his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,\nshe had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And\nwith that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both\ncheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He\n violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his\nhands."An angel from heaven could not be more\nwelcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was\nprominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,\nwhoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked\nabout carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have\nyou never been to see me?Didn\'t you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in\na circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to\nsee you, you know--"\n\n"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam\nBeaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk\nwith me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the\nrichly-gowned girl before him.But he\nnodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had\nmourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me\nto-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then\nshe entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he\ncould see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father\nWaite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had\nbeen a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven\'t anything but money, and\nfine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange\ngirl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman\'s lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not\nreply."And I\'m going to love you," the girl continued.You\'re\ntired of society gabble and gossip; you\'re tired of spending on\nyourself the money you never earned; you\'re not a bit of use to\nanybody, are you?You\'re a sort of tragedy, aren\'t\nyou?There are just lots of them in high society, just as\nweary as you.And they lack the very\ngreatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money\nwill buy, just love!they don\'t realize that, in\norder to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must\nthemselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love\neverybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only\ntheir perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any\nsort.In a week\'s time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don\'t know anything but\nlove.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see\nwhat there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don\'t see anything\nbut good--everywhere.""I--I don\'t mind your talking\nthat way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn\'t bear to listen to\nany more religion."Love is the\ntie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"\n\n"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge\ninto just one, some day, and, instead of saying \'I believe,\' everybody\nwill say \'I understand and I love.\'Why, the very person who loved\nmore than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just\nsimply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God\'s children are not to be\npitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,\naren\'t we?And then you are\ngoing to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to\ntake up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an\natmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"\n\n"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my\nlife.I leave everything to Him, and then\nkeep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will\nremove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her\nfew brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the\nhand that guided her!CHAPTER 19\n\n\nTo the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of\nAmerican millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire\nnecessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic\ntraffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a\ndecrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom\nwas likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself\nthat Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and\nher unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count\nor baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when\nthe young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her\nbeautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad\nand other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be\nduly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy\nyoung cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful\nsociety leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good\nfriends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were\nrestless.Hawley-Crowles,\nbeaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she\'ll have to be--coached a bit, ye\nknow--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn\'t help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent\nprospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me\nblooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she\'s yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She\'ll\narrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter\nto consult in regard to her son\'s matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking\nround of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite\nforgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled\ndeliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a\nhalf hour\'s conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house\nof Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had\nhastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,\nonly awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive\nthat she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored\nby the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful\ngirl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly\nin debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,\ntoo, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a\nconsultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good\nfortune fell into the lady\'s spacious lap.Reed had written that he\nwas doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to\nraise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the\nSimiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make\nher home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his\nSimiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly\nacquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a\nday before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a\ngenius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest\nstockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The\nLord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,\nMadam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are\nrapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim\nwould like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your\nset, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant\nair.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for\nrecognition!"And there\'s my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He\'s president of the C.\nand R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange\nit," she said.What is Joplin\nZinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according\nto the latest report.*       *       *       *       *\n\nMeantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd\nthe young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept\nhis appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon\nCarmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had\nbeen watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in\nthe music room, "where\'s Jude?Why, I haven\'t the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned\nthe puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from\nme.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what\nare you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you\'re free.The chains have dropped, haven\'t\nthey?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you\'re like a prisoner coming\nout of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You\'re only blinking,\nthat\'s all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be\ntrue I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants\nto marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an\nInca princess, and yet I don\'t know who I am; my own people apparently\nare swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment\nhere in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself\nfrom flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for\nthe present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a\nCatholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with\nMadam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"\n\n"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames\'s sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also\ngoing to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and\nlooked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels\nfollowed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood\neying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to\nCarmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware\nthat you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father\nWaite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the\nchurchman\'s insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman\'s brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood\nby the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate\nNemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from\nme a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be\nauthority: \'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!\'"Finally a bland\nsmile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me\nto unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your\nbeliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You\nhave come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts\nwhich you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are\nthey a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect\nthe intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told\nme that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it\nor you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl\'s stinging rebuke.When she\nconcluded he rose to go.You have left the Church\nof which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that\nChurch, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful\nwrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his\nguard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no\noccasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently\ninformed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do\nme great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your\neternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon\nacceptance of the Church\'s doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle\'s eyes.But he replied affably: "When\npreachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes\nquite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside\nauthority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is\nJesus Christ, who said: \'Love thy neighbor as thyself.\'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon\nyour little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to\ntake the poor people\'s money to support an institution so politically\nreligious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their\nmoney to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined\npurgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural\nwarrant--"\n\n"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there\nis such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the\nexistence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an\ninfinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts\nof money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of\nthe dying--"\n\n"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in\nremoving their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,\na sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week\nafter week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit\ntheir sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes\nupon me as I preached the \'authority\' of the Fathers!Well I knew\nthat, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if\nbaptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my\nwords!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had\njoined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,\ncould I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false\nmessage of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And\nyet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of\nHoly Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds\ninto a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further\nhuman progress.""It is to be regretted," he said\ncoldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede\nthe salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls\nhave I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really\nsaved!From misery,\ndisease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory\nconstructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be\nmore convenient for us both--and you are alone--"\n\nCarmen laughed."Don\'t quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender\nabjectly.And you were quite\nindiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently\nlamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am\npossessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,\nMonsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare\nabove all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to\nassist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned\ngently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of\nthe inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval\ntheology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our\nso-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of\nconscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and\nfalse creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this\nfair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church\nsupremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization\nthen obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all\nCatholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their\noppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to\nthe dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of\nconscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of\nthe clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point\nto France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,\ncalls herself Catholic.Germany is\nforsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an\ninvitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories\nenunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often\nblindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our\nfathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived\nfrom the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon\nit; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,\nirrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people\ncontinue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric\npromise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,\nyour willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of\nconcrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the\ntime has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,\nand all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so\nquenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the\nChrist.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era\nwhich promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which\nbinds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at\nlast beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As\nin chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters\nreligious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so\na new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim\nperception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus\nChrist.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to\nevery one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has\nresulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most\nmarvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come\nswiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day\nthan our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already\ngrowing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the\nacceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world\'s great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly\nperceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how\nto grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and\ntold us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite\'s earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed\nupon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him\nand vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in\nexpectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in\na pleading tone:\n\n"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,\nCatholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your\nideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue\nto persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of\nthe views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,\nas is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred\nmillion Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you\npresume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the\nChurch an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that\nthe earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"\n\n"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is\na solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and\nsensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,\nand the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all\ncapable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned\nsuggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The\nbeliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time\nnational customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and\nundemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true\nprogress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind\nnarrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then\nmercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors\nand stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me\nfor obeying Christ\'s command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in\na tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church\nwhich you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout\nthe ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"\nnodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when\nthey have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;\nwe are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander\nand untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an\nexemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy\nlight.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous\nattacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns\nupon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without\nsoiling one\'s hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"\nshe replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right\nthinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart\nbelieve that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,\ndogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably\nfollow the right understanding of Jesus\' teachings, even according to\nthese words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the\nformula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding\nas in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image\nfrom glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and\nfollowing his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which\nis God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though\nslowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all\nsense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the\nfungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have\nsprung up about the Master\'s simple words?Why the wretched\nformalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church\'s frigid,\nlifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God\nwhich marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its\nutility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of\nmankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the\nroot of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of\nthe Master\'s day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her\npriests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of\nritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a\ntarget for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,\nthe appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with\nthis girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters\nportended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the\nfoundations of his cherished system.She\nnettled and exasperated him.Did he\nhave the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of\nHoly Church?He turned upon the girl and her\ncompanion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he\ncould not control.Abuse the Church\nas you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles\nbefore her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty\npower, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless\nwealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object\nof worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day\nfor her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are\nEnglish, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her\nsupreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all\nmelt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but\nomnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of\nmillions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking\ncalumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,\nbeware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is\nthe steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of\nfear, ignorance, and intolerance--"\n\n"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose\nConstitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"\n\nCarmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the\nfounders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and\nthey were wise according to their light.But we of this day are\nstill wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of\nmental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are\nwelcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the\nopinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those\nwho do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are\noutcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church\'s\nhatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has\nnot been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not\nagree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution\ndoes not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter\nthe minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form\nof disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,\nMonsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to\nthe point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war\nnot against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the\nhuman mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl\'s strong words.His face\nhad grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have\nthreatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You\nare very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,\nyou would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames\nof hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great\nexample of Jesus\' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or\nthe carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said\nin a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite\nmisunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as\nthis is stimulating, don\'t you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than\nI the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend\nhas told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him\nnarrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot\nour little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted\nwith Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While\nthe girl talked the Beaubien\'s expression grew serious.Then Carmen\nlaunched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:\n"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how\nserious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn\'t nearly as important as to know what he thinks about\nMonsignor\'s errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would\nbe very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my\npresence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do\nnow?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans\nfor the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours\' ride with J.\nWilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20\n\n\nThe Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen\nnestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the\nlight luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don\'t look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl\'s flowing locks."I\nwill try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite\nwere here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I\nknow I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and\npowerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I\'d\nknow it wasn\'t true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the\nwoman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can\'t_\nbe externalized to me, for I know that \'There shall no mischief happen\nto the righteous,\' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around\nthe room, as if to summon her strength."I\'m going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have\nbeen wrong.I--I\nhave lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better\nthings in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half\nclosed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in\nevery life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the\nwoman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I\ncan give is, you.I don\'t know what you did to people in South\nAmerica; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you\nwent you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people\ndiffers with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It\nmust have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so\nignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled\ndown into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:\n\n"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you\nwere the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration\nof every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,\nindeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless\nDiego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why\nshould you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman\'s knees, "that\nisn\'t what\'s worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me\ninside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,\ndon\'t you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no\ndesire to change back."Ames\nand I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and\nI played his game with him.And at a time when he had\ninvolved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton\ndeal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that\nto involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me\nnow, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every\nform of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien\'s chair."Is it\nbecause you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you\nfinancially?"He couldn\'t ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded\nto a whisper, "I haven\'t any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the\nwoman\'s neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks\nwas at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged\nme through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged\nwith him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I\nmight get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn\'t know\nwhat I was doing, until you came!And now I\'d hang on the cross if I\ncould undo it!And he has you and me in his\nclutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed\nviolently."Be still, and _know_ that I am\nGod."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her\ntears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman\'s\nhead to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien\'s hand shook as she clasped Carmen\'s."I can\'t turn to\nKane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I\'ve\nruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"\n\n"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can\'t you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his\ndirection," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I\'m sure he holds something over\nyou and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his\nChurch--anything to--"\n\n"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"\n\n"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl\'s lap and sobbed\nbitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,\nno matter what seems to be or to happen, for \'underneath are the\neverlasting arms.\'Hawley-Crowles told me this\nmorning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I\nknow."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with\nher to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to\n"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is\nconcerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to\ncomfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the\nrelentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her\nthoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have\nhelped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for\nwhom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man\ntacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog\nwith expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,\nbasked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own\nSimiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and\nsmirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it\ncopied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames\nand her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a\ncall from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman\'s\nmeeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he\nleft the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a\nmenace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of\nthe year, barring the famous _Bal de l\'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it\ncan\'t be possible that the hussy doesn\'t intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles\ndrenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I\'d call her up and ask,\nif I dared," she groaned.And, to the\namazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held\nwithout the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles\nand her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was\ninstantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,\nsummoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There\nwere present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he\ntimidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking\nhands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to\nHarris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to\ninaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,\nwondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames\'s long\narms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and\npressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems\nto have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because\nmy brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the\nstock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I\nlearn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim\'s eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he\nheard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite\ndistance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and\nsaw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,\nI personally visited the mine in question."The\nproperty was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it\nunder the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived\nthe clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to\nissue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La\nLibertad.""Well, I don\'t see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the\ndeath of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the\nChurch.""By what right does it belong to the\nChurch?""By the ancient law of _\'en manos muertas\'_, my friend," replied Ames,\nunperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will\nexplain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate\nsituation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,\nthe confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the\nname Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from\nColombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,\nfollowing the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that\nday, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the\nChurch, invoking the old law of _\'en manos muertas\'_ which, being\ntranslated, means, \'in dead hands.\'Pious Catholics of many lands have\ndone the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property\nin the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of\nin any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of\nMasses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I\nassure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the\npains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the\ndiscovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite\nnull."turning savagely\nupon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he\nwill explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of\nthe widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of\nthe notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals\nwith Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own\nholdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of\nthis young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his\ntrembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending\nelevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and\nnight.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in\nthe startling report of the Simiti Company\'s collapse, as set forth in\nthe newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a\nsoft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and\nread to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible\ninvitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were other events forward at the same time, which came to light\nthat fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a\nnight of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional\nexclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding\nnight, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate\nlay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it\nopen, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune\nlay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The\ncall came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is\nreported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the\nillegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We\nwould like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that\nyou and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames\nreception last evening."Hawley-Crowles\'s legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered\nfrom the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on\nthe table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines\nannouncing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly\nburst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a\nlow, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped\nher way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the\nBeaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as\nit halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as\na reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the\nHawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way\nto see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source\nthat your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your\nparentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His\nname--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem\nof her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I\'m not up on Spanish\nnames," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I\'m sure I can\'t say."But--you think it was, don\'t you?""Well, I don\'t believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn\'t a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I\nwas his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn\'t you?But she took you out of a house down on--"\n\n"Yes.And I\'ve tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I\'m sure I don\'t know.You think this Diego might\nhave been your father?That is, you can\'t say positively that he\nwasn\'t?"You can come up to the\nhouse and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous\ngirl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination\nmeans in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought\nthat she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We\'ll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her\npapers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I\nfinish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien\nat her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily\nbrush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I\nshould have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn\'t give\nher any hope.And yet," she reflected\nsadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread\nupon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and\ndirected the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they\nentered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying\nextras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to\nthe girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien\'s hand.Then there\nflitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the\npsalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy\nright hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against\nthe Beaubien\'s shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something\nthrough the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the\nstartling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,\nand hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the\nawful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her\nbedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA\n\n\n\n\nBOOK 4\n\n\n                Watchman, what of the night?The watchman said, The morning cometh.--_Isaiah._\n\n\n\n\nCARMEN ARIZA\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nThe chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined\ncanons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its\ndeserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from\nquivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human\nhopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among\nthe naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master\nfar out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony\namong the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in\npitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had\nbetrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender\ngirl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the\nsharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to\na young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,\nleaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl\nlooked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his\ncoat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin\nand worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl\nturned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into\nthe old man\'s wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a\ncomprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek\nnor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of\ndefilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl\'s\nright to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about\nher feet.She stooped and\ntook up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no\ncomment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk\nwalking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running\nrapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother\ndear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager\neyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take\nwhat I wish.Hitt\'s coming to call to-night and bring a\nfriend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then\nshe glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in\nher eyes and said, "Don\'t you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I\'m afraid it wouldn\'t look well," he said."And, besides, I don\'t dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien\'s\nreluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it\nto-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous\nembrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,\nvery mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of\nboth the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and\nlooking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock\nseverity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in\nthe waiting lap, "he told, didn\'t he?Can\'t I ever trust you with a\nsecret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged\nthis had I not seen in the incident something more than mere\nchance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a\nstupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw\na need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another\'s\ngood."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,\ndearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast\nher bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,\nwondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared\nCarmen, rising.And she departed for the\nkitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is\nguiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a\nmanifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,\nunasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no\nmiracle, no luck about it.It was--it\nwas--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if\nwe only knew--"\n\n"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is\nbut the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to\ncomprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to\nthat end I have been formulating a great plan.That\'s why I\'ve asked\nHitt to come here to-night.Remember, my\ndear friend, we are true searchers; and \'all things work together for\ngood to them that love God.\'Our love of truth and real good is so\ngreat that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is\n_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this\nlowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the\ntired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those\nmental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim\nand a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to\na bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even\nAmes himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his\nrelentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But\nwhen he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were\nset forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl\'s parentage\nand of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to\nsocial heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to\nthe death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this\ntale, which even the girl could not refute?He had\nsailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was\ncringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him\nbail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to\nLa Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy\nhands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,\nperhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor\nin the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she\ntold a straightforward story, could not say positively that the\npublished statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew\nit, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days\nimmediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions\nand leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that\nbrowbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of\nher relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to\nEngland, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized\nmother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames\'s lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,\nand laid it before the judge who fed from his master\'s hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the\ndry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen\nand flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who\nhad sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold\nmillions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it\nin his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious\ndame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate\nGannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle\nmachinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example\nto the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,\nand rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living\ndeath in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and\nconcentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone\nstood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in\nlife; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence\nregarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the\ngirl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at\ndrastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned\nits full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood\nat length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the\nsocial set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud\nof bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and\nthey made the most of it.As a result, several of them found\nthemselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was\nconfronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to\ntestify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the\nlatter\'s word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of\nmaudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he\nknew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk\nand plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant\nremains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and\nwithdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the\ncountry, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances\nnecessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers\nstrove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to\nAmes.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,\nwho placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little\nhouse, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed\nthither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen\nsaw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had\nthrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She\nhad wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see\nagain the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night\nwhen the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she\nwould have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have\nbelieved her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in\nher arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in\nher.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise\nto come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town\nrestaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her\nunworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,\nand she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen\'s glad cry echoed through the little\nhouse: "Oh, mother dear, we\'re free, we\'re free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow\nwas wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood\nbefore her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of\ncruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,\nlastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the\ndestruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had\ncome to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she\nhad never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound\nto come.And, but for the comforting presence of\nthat sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was\nCarmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,\nwound her soft arms about the Beaubien\'s neck, as she lay tossing in\nmental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite\nLove which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who\nwhispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy\nreflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of\ntheir pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what\nconstitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never\nknown that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they\nreflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized\nworld, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all\nyour heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy\ntransgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;\nand she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty\nheart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The\nBeaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone\nout forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The\nColombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her\nsinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed\nagainst that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the\nthroes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;\nbut she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the\nstaff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty\ntouch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world\nwhich she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had\ncast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against\nevery accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,\nof loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of\nself-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they\nhurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood\nclad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,\nsuffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would\nhave gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for\nmercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite\nthe havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the\nBeaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness\nalone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he\nbecame the chief of apostles.When the light came, he\nshut the door against the past.If he hadn\'t, dearest, he never could\nhave done what he did.Ames, will have to do the\nsame."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of\nsoul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by\nthe foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous\nwrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him\nfathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I\'ve just longed for some reasonable\nexcuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was\nhelping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the\nHawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can\nattach myself--"\n\n"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really\ngoing to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused\nand smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,\nFather Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I\'ve got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it\'s me for\nthe mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb\nas I. Oh, I\'ve been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away\nfrom this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of\nthe little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the\nmanager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his\nerrand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a\ncontract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over\nthe society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful\nproposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man\nfirmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as\none who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not\ndistant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove\nthe stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The\ngenuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took\nhim at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre\nJose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And\nwho was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a\nfriendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that\nfall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological\nexplorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And\nthe long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled\nstimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time\nbefore announced his determination to study there that winter, as long\nas his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the\ndoor of the political arena, where there is such great need of real\nmen, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I\nshall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the\nhelp I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien\'s\npermission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and\nwas accepted.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend\nhad come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had\ndriven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to\nthe urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in\nwhich I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen\'s eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as\nFather Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less\nastonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here\nto-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified\nlines of human thought.I have stood as the\nembodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the\nmightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For\nyears I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive\nassumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought\nwith sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of\nhumanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the\nChristian era and its progress down through the centuries, through\nheavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and\nsubsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems\nto be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New\nWorld.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble\npriests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet\nmovements.And so I\nwithdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen\'s thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose\nexperience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had\nbeen too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented\nthe great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated\nthe system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal\nwarfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my\nchurchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his\nthought are damned.we both claimed the same\ndivine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We\nwere two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other\n_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we\nbrothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure\nto understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with\nour elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said\nHitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of\neager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt\nmoved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl\'s spiritual development I believe to be very largely\nhis work."He knew but little as yet of her\npast association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called\nChristian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other\nhand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for\nredemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my\nfrankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us\nall--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must\nnow admit."She started to speak, but Father\nWaite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall\nrepresents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world\nto-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great\nclass who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems\nof theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or\nepicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I\'m a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify\nCarmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he\nreplied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and\npreachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity\'s\ntroubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which\nJesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of\ndeath, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to\nhave descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of\nremitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by\nvoicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that\nwhat I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death\nmight end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you\nwould refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table\nall who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is\nthe only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You\nare not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an\nunbeliever.And therefore are you \'_anathema_,\' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very\nseriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something\nthat the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are\nseeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I\nam fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the\npriestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the\nflesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice\ninto his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the\njugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile\ntheir opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make\nto the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are\nbaptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,\nsprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries\nyou have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn\'t it time to get\ndown to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who\ndiffers with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of\nthe simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving\none\'s neighbor as one\'s self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world\'s\nopinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would\nnot Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who\nadvocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men\'s minds, and\nthen leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye\nentered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye\nhindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a\nliving protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human\nmind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever\nnobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;\nand, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know\nwhat I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,\nif any.I don\'t care two raps about a God who can\'t help me here on\nearth, who can\'t set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my\nneeds, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a\nGod, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common\nsense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the\ngrandest thing in life!But\nyou preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You\'re scared stiff\nwhen you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand\npreparation for death.Yet it isn\'t the gateway to life to you, and\nyou know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to\nyour trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I\ndon\'t, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for\nearnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,\nthat I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once\nor twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"\nhis voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this\nyoung girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The\nworld knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;\nwhy they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God\nas Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must\nlove their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,\ncheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering\nwhy they don\'t know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever\nworking out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that\nJesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and\nreflected for a moment.Then:\n\n"The ancient prophet said: \'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye\nshall search for me with all your hearts.\'It is my proposal that we\nbind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse\ntalents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of\nthe ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an\nintimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical\ninterpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical\nsciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their\nearnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world\'s\nneeds.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And\nCarmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully\nlacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,\ndeepest spirituality.Shall we\nundertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and\nthe basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of\nthat worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her\nmagnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the\nspirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,\nbroken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw\nher arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this\nchild\'s religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the\nmumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, \'Having seen me ye have seen God,\'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you\nhave indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2\n\n\n"I\'m afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending\ntheir way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen\nis the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who\nare always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in\nthe warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She\nisn\'t quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an\nimpossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the\nvery kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years\nbring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed\nbeneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect\nits mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I\'d like to see her under stress--"\n\n"Under stress!You haven\'t the slightest conception\nof the stress she\'s been under most of her life!But your criticism\nunconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by\nword, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl\nhas stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like\ngold leaf!"She\'s so far and away ahead\nof mortals like you and me that she doesn\'t admit the reality and\npower of evil--and, believe me, she\'s got her reasons for not\nadmitting it, too!Only try humbly to\nattain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid\nmaking yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind\'s age-long blunder--and they have\nthereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself\non being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he\nchose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams\nof our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his\nlivelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a\nsprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would\nhave appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek\nsophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd\nwas a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed\nto be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in\ngeneral.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped\ndeeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering\nand blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow\ndepths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of\nserving the Lord, and turned cynic.It\nwas likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for\nhimself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had\nemployed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking\nover the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was\naltogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and\nso he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he\nhad ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his\nsinecure.And as justification for his\nself-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and\nI could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be\nintolerable to me."He simply shirked\nresponsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I\'m a\npseudo-litterateur--I conduct a \'Who\'s It?\'for the quidnunces of this\nblase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method\nof suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,\nthat all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to\nrun those base squibs about you; but, by George!I\'m going to make a\nretraction in next Saturday\'s issue.I\'ll put a crimp in friend Ames\nthat\'ll make him squeal.I\'ll say he has ten wives, and eight of \'em\nZulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without\ngoing out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it\nwill, in the right way."Say, don\'t you\nthink that in formulating a new religion you\'re carrying coals to\nNewcastle?Seems to me we\'ve got enough now, if we\'d practice \'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a\nNazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we\nmeet on common ground, don\'t we?"She held out her hand, and he took\nit, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we\'ll have to dispute that later.I\nsee Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But\nwe\'ll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes\ntwinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,\nbecause there\'s no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she\nturned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,\nwhich was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell\nupon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a\nmission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally\ntouches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in\nthis and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of\nthe wisdom of Epictitus, who said, \'What do I want?To acquaint myself\nwith the true order of things and comply with it.\'I am sure no\nstatement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know\nand comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again\nbecame serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much\nmisery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity\ntheir stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen\'s hand stole toward the\nBeaubien\'s and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, \'There is no God!\'And\nyet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind\'s very\nexistence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole\ncause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or\nother, is so vitally related to humanity as this: \'Is there a God?\'And the corollary: \'What is His relation to me?\'For there can be\nnothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence\nof a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in\nview of the world\'s testimony?If the\nBible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of\nour so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say\nby them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present\nwe are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There\nhas been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step\nfurther, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in\nChristianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of\nright conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely\nsaid, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and\ntact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental\nbias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,\nas I recall it."As have been many of the world\'s most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,\nto resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the\npersonality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be\nestablished?"queried Miss Wall in greater\nsurprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that\ntruth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave\nus the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily\nneeds?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may\nknow that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may\nbe utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,\n"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I\nthink, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If\nwe conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material\nuniverse and man.And what are their natures and\nimport?""Seems to me you\'ve cut out a large\nassignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world\nhas played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can\nsettle them in a few evenings\' study?We can\'t spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at\nCarmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he\nsaid."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,\ngive us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the\nmodern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been\npropounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary\nattitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager\nexpectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most\ninteresting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age\nis one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries\nand astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views\nthat the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly\ntossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so\nmercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the\nmanuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have\ngrown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that\nwhich can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,\nbuilding up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and\nat night we repair the machine for the next day\'s run.Even our\ncollege professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and\nresearch.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost\nexclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material\nlivelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its\nlarder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,\nwherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to\nthe ceiling as he resumed:\n\n"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not\noften speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as\nthat we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we\nceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes\nin bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as\nwell--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to\nspeak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and\nvital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen\nis--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of\nsentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an\nopportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he\ncontinued:\n\n"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable\nsuccess in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,\nlike a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is\nessential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or\nvital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has\nnever proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of\nstrain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of\nmaterial wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is\nsuicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal\npleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is\nreal and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to\nsay the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested\nHaynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are\nthe wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual\nhimself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the\npith of my observations.And no sane\nman will maintain that general reform can ever come until the\nindividual\'s needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a\nquestion of man\'s concept of the cause of things, himself included,\nand their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is\nhourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no\nother basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which\nto build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew\nhow_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don\'t do as we\ntell \'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you\never do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single\nhuman difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so\nthe world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the\ngrave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the\nfolly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and\npitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out\nto the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I\nmisread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that\ntheir end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and\nhence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we\ntouch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if\nthere ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the\npleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of\nthe business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce\nhonesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the\nneed of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and\nthat is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,\nhowever eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the\npromise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of\nthe grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this\nfact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous\nworld-yearning to know and to do better.I\nanswer, a growing appreciation of the idea that \'the kingdom of\nharmony is within you.\'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was\nan influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,\nthat\'something not ourselves,\' if you will, \'that makes for\nrighteousness.\'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly\nexternalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That\'something not ourselves\' is the germ of the true idea of God,"\nanswered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a\nfinal observation.Mankind\'s beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the\nworld\'s flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in\nthought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord\nwho started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,\nwith the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The\nidea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and\ntemporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His\ngreatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a\nconception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and\nuniversally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and\nneeds.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged\nand purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our\ndaily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in\nthis world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the\nheavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming\nconscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,\nimmortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be\nnaught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by\nhumanity as the \'old man\' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,\nnecessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And\nwhat constitutes the \'old man\'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he\nsaid, meditatively, "that man\'s progress has been proportionate to his\nfreedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man\'s concept of God has grown less and\nless material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of\nthe savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,\nto whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man\'s progress has\nbeen marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or\nother, in material power and substance.The development of the least\nmaterial forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the\nhuman mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to\nfuture generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all\nthings is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the\ncreation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such\ndeductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the\ndeductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single\npremise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I\nthink we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant\nits creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The\ncreator must be--"\n\n"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a\nflood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning\nhelter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if\nit were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that\'s what causes the evil\nin the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite\nmind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very\nnecessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause\ndisintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very\nnecessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must\nlikewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its\nexistence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving\nthe girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed\ndistances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And\ngood includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,\ntruth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not\nby human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His\nexistence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods\nof suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on\nyour deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith\nwhere human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day\nknow.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and\nthrough His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and\ninfinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that\ngrandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see\nabout you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That\nman is God\'s own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have\nobeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be\nmental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence\nHe must include this imperfect representation, called the physical\nman."Did not Jesus speak often of\nthe one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material\nuniverse are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;\nnot real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition\nthat there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don\'t quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The\ncreator of all things is mind.But you would have that\nmind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown\nthat, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever\nwhole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind\nexpresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative\nmind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be\nevil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it\ncreates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of\nmixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy\nitself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to\naccount for evil, when God is infinite good--"\n\n"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it\nsomething real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a\nlie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,\nsince He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the\nopposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories\nreturned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first\ntalked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a\nsuppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is\nthe great lie of evil.And matter is just as\nmental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word\'real,\'" he said, "is perhaps\nwhat is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to\nSpencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,\nforever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very\nincorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,\n_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing\nitself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,\npower?""But now we have been brought back again to\nthe question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not\nreal substance, we will have established Carmen\'s premise that\neverything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between\nthe mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in\nhuman existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have\nestablished, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing\nexisting implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being\ninfinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be\ninfinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,\nomniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the\ncreator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present\nmind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have\ndiscussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest\nthat we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that\nhas marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful\nvoice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien\nhad rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while\nthe young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious\nexpression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven\nfor earth.CHAPTER 3\n\n\nWith her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad\nstage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the\nlethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the\nmodern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own\nagainst the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in\nher favor.The lethal influences which\nrose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been\nlifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes\ninto which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper\ncomprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She\nknew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her\nsocial life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to\n"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of\nthe "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest\nagainst them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart\nof so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the\ndisappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,\nwho had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred\nprecincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now\nfloundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen\ninsight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this\nlatest century\'s obsessing idea that the true function of education is\nexpressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a\ntraining for the business of earning one\'s daily bread according to\nthe infamous code of the world\'s carnal social system.The University\ndid not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to\nstand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach\nmen to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather\nemphasized the world\'s belief in the reality of this man by minutely\ndetailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his\npitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To\nCarmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind\'s\nexistence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated\nmanifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely\nrecognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it\nconfessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to\nknow whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain\nanswers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to\n"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider\nknowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs\nand problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her\nFather\'s business.The weak, transient,\nflighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no\ncall across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was\nreligious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to\nknow God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety\nwhich had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of\ncuriosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the\nfirst semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been\ndebated in the numerous Sororities and Women\'s Clubs, and quietly\ndropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental\ndisgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened\nreputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,\nmalicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength\nhad made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen\ndivined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no\nindication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found\nfavor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they\nknew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer\nrestrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the\nconclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority\nin the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the\nmost brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl\'s skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What\nthough her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty\ndecreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would\nhave bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a\nlittle _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an\neligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident\nas he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,\nwealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If\nwe could have maintained Carmen\'s reputation as an Inca princess, this\nsame girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge\nof her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to\ningratiate herself into Carmen\'s favor, to catch the social crumbs\nthat our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that\nCarmen is at all injured by Miss West\'s supercilious conduct?"You\'re forgetting the girl\'s influence, aren\'t\nyou?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that\ngirl\'s an angel!"She\'s so real that we don\'t\nunderstand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the\npetty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that\'s\nall.""But certainly she is unique--"\n\n"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people\nand telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like\nan exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after\nher as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to\nhear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that\nthe dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,\nfairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the\nempty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been\nthrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her\nparentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was\nno engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did\nso, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing\nupon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle\nfilched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on\nher back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she\'s unique--so\nunique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off\nabsently into space: \'If it is right that he should have a son, then I\nwant it to be so.\'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: \'God is\nlight.Old\nRosendo\'s grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating\nwhat would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon\nGod\'s protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That\'s\nwhy she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that\nmine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don\'t dare to\ndo!_"\n\n"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty\nfact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want\nyou to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her \'the girl with the\nUtopian views,\' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological\nclass.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being\nimpractical.""I\'ll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I\'ll prove to Cane that her\nreligion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited\nonly by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day\nsinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,\nshe is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual\nimproves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"\nreturned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and\nwent, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the\nsupreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of\nthe home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not\nto have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life\nwas a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature\nvoiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted\nleaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt\ngaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I\njust couldn\'t stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of\nboundless good!"For her dark\nstory had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and\neven in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked\naskance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like\nProfessor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into\nthe depths of the girl\'s soul, took an immediate and increasing\ninterest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of\nconvention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of\nlearning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the\nSchool of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the\ngirl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had\nchosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her\neager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she\nmet with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton\'s\nprivate laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human\nbrain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise\nwritten large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and\nlooking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a\ngray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with\nkeen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I\'d love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it\ndoesn\'t make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She\nlooked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his\nheartstrings."You\'re as welcome as the April\nsun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,\nlooking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my\nerstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into\nher eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That\nwe may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,\nand the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don\'t you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you\nsearch now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;\nand \'Canst thou by searching find out God?\'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while\nover the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know\nHim is to reflect life.Doctor, don\'t\nyou think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The\nabrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn\'t really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,\nwondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she\nasked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it\nnot?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don\'t know.We call it the organ\nof thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with\nit, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are\nintimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:\n\n"Doctor, you wouldn\'t cut up a machine to discover the motive power,\nwould you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,\naren\'t you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if\nthe brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever\nlived, it could never die.It\nmanifested only a false sense of life.Who\nor what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human\nmind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in\ndeath, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look\nwith a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don\'t you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the\nbrain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved\nsimultaneously, the brain being the mind\'s organ of expression.""But don\'t you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really\ncome first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to\nthe thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a\npractical knowledge of how to meet the brain\'s ills.I am a practical\nman, you know.""I\'m sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so\nstupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and\nstaring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn\'t want to think you stupid\nand ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o\' takes the edge off your former classification\nof me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to\nplace upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn\'t it?You see,\nthe great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that\nmind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the\ntime.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The\nopposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called\n\'negative truth.\'Of course, there isn\'t any such thing as negative\ntruth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real\nexistence."Now, the human, or\ncarnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is\ninfinite mind\'s suppositional opposite.And it imitates the\ninfinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole\nphysical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or\nrevealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these\nmanifest the human mind\'s sense of life, and its equally strong\nsense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,\nevolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are\nthe human mind\'s interpretations of infinite mind\'s real and eternal\nand perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of \'negative truth\', the first\nchapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter\nsets forth its opposite, negative truth.But\nthere it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true\nto its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen\'s attention had been attracted to a large microscope\nthat stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously\ndown into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have\nyou got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite\nserious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you\nhaven\'t anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low\nvoice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which\nis mental," she added."These things don\'t cause disease," she went\non, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I\'ll tell you," she said."_It\'s because they don\'t know enough\nto live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn\'t know that God\nwas life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He\nsinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by\nbelieving that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the\nwages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that\'s all.""You haven\'t asked me\nto sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don\'t mind, I\nwill."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily\nsetting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were\nsaying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,\n"I\'ll sit here, so\'s I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead\nand cut up poor Yorick, and I\'ll talk.""You are much more interesting," he\nreturned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was\nquite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you\ndo give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life\nthan in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven\'t a bit of use\nfor it," she continued."It\'s like making mistakes in music, or\nmathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to\ndiscuss them.The world has nearly\ntalked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated\nsickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit\nupon a great truth, although they didn\'t make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases\nuntil all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive\nsins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until\nJesus came.And that cured\nthe disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,\nnearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis\ndid, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental\ncause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that\nthe people would cry, \'He hath a devil!\'They thought I was a witch in\nSimiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is\ncaused by microbes, I take it?"It is a\nmanifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,\ndiphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own\ncherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders\ninnocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its\nown diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by\nhuman, material methods.At last it\nyields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls\ndeath.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various\nmanifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,\neven of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the\ngirl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can\nonly answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which\nyou suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring\nunder!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has\ndoctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that\nhealth is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the\nhistory of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:\n\n"Don\'t they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure\ndisease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures\ncrime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed\ndisease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,\ncame too soon, said: \'Without me ye can do nothing.\'Well, didn\'t he\ncome very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did\nnot say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,\nbut that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as\nbefore, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result\nfrom sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about\nthings.Its effect,\ndisease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with\ndrugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in\none\'s state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey\nand opium, or of the human body\'s reaction to them, causes a change in\nthe human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of\nhuman consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of\nmind.And Doctor Bolton--"\n\n"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general\nbreakdown," was the doctor\'s refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately\nobdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don\'t you know\nthat you doctors are only a development of the old\'medicine-man\'?Bolton isn\'t dead; and, in the second, there\nare no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that\'s gone out of\nfashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not\nexpect to die.""I expect good, nothing but\ngood, ever!Don\'t you know that physiologists themselves admit that\nthe human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen\nper cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and\nsensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,\nstomach, or liver?Why, the so-called \'unit cell\' breathes, digests,\nand manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no\nstomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power\nwhich it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend\nupon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human\nmind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the\nChrist-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to\nbe only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the\npreachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the\nconclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,\n"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,\nmalice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest\nto the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and\nthey produce toxins, which poison the system.It is\nthe Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to\napply it.But if you don\'t care to, why, then you must go on with your\nmaterial microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until\nyou are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all\nhuman-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or\nlife, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of\ndivine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day\nin which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is\nonly a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is\nin a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the\nrange of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare\nbegan as a single cell.The mundane concept of\nShakespeare\'s body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but\nShakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an\ninterpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why\ncan\'t you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would\nchoke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"\n\n"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are\nso generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false\nculture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She\nopened her note book and read:\n\n  "\'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this\n  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that\n  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of\n  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.\'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor\nmeet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of\nyour greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they\nyearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they\nbelieved in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they\nnot rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no\nsuch resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how\nto overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood\nthere before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had\ndrifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I\'d like\nto have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I\nhave barked at each other for many years now, and I\'m getting tired.I\'d like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I\nbelieve you\'ve been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"\n\n"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested\nin these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have\nregular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"\n\n"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend\nPat wouldn\'t thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is\na very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of\nhis self-esteem.Well, we\'ll see, we\'ll see."I didn\'t really mean to come in here, you\nknow.But I guess I was led, don\'t you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside\nthe pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the\nBeaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University\nSchool of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl\'s\nunusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might\nhear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books\nand hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she\nlaunched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an\nastounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that\nday long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking\nexpression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short\nwhile before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from\nher soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft\nmelodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued\nfrom the absorbed girl\'s lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from\nthe room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving\nto interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own\nbeing, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those\nof this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her\nauditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to\ncome out!""Who, may I ask, was your\nteacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man\'s face.He turned to Father\nWaite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl\'s\nwords."I wonder if you realize what you\nhave got, Miss Carmen?""It\'s a beautiful gift, isn\'t it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare\nnot undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send\nMaitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I\'ll sing for anybody.The gift isn\'t\nmine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien\nreturned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized\nit and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her\nbeloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant\ncoast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains\nand evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,\nRosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up\nthe Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were\nsafe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,\nsinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his\npossible share in the cause of Jose\'s silence.CHAPTER 4\n\n\nCarmen\'s first serious test of her knowledge of English composition\nwas made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;\nand so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her\nto send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the\nessay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and\nstill another article on the life and customs of her people.Both\nwere given publication; and with the money which she received for them\nshe bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman\'s\nsurprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money\ntoward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and\nwas inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"\ncommented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured\nthe money out into somebody\'s open hand anyway, and it might as well\nbe Jude\'s."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home\nevery night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been\nin the morning.Carmen\'s slight success in the field of letters still further aroused\nHaynerd\'s interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,\nmight awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as\nhers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would\nshe furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of\nthe metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative\nsheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people\nsat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual\nangle upon certain phases of New York\'s social life, and uncovered a\nfew of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,\nwhen his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he\nglowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding\ngenius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien\nfinancially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to\nearn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he\nbent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the\nUniversity--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and\nadvice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he\nwould trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital\npoint.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that\nshe attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the\ngreat Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand\nimpressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in\nseclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent\nrecognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity\nfor rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it\nwould help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the\n_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly\nfinished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in\nenamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the\nnewspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of\nMrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at\nvarious foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the\nformer\'s impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no\nlonger deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned\nto conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual\nbrilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had\nhimself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,\nbecause he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of\nhis complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,\ncupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of\nwhat it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in\na flash that side of its owner\'s life which for so many months she had\nbeen pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the\nmassive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she\nturned and clasped Haynerd\'s arm with the feeling that she would\nsuffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We\'ll go round\nto the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames\'s secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to\nbring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely\nwrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous\nbronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,\nstreamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw\nmany whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,\nswinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the\nmultimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled\nwith the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the\ntraffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept\nup and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a\nsharp rap from a policeman\'s club sent them scattering.Carmen stood\nfor a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble\nsteps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen\nand senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one\nowed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard\nand fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual\nglance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing\nabout them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the\nground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering\never closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,\nbowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped\nblithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the\nskeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and\nshimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a\ntremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans\nof poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and\nsorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being\nwho dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the\ncarnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were\nscattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he\npassed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took\nimmediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage\nand to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,\nopening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them\ninto a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he\nbade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we\'ve crossed\nthe Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in\na business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for\napproval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that\nimperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern\nsociety in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business\nand social standing, and other data.You\nwill say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered\nunder one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will\ntotal not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed\nwill foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again\nconsulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by\nMrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of\nthe famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his\nmenu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the\nneighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table\ndecorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian\nartists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the\nguest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from\nevery part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty\nsketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand\nsalon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what\nnotes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to\nyou later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not\nexpected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to\nthe balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the\nyoung woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony\noverlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed\nthem, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music\nfrom a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in\nthe still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as\nthey tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down\nupon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately\ntinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like\ngold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,\nwhich had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The\ngreat windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over\nwhich fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall\nand the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides\nof the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian\ncarpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the\nsalon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the\nmezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak\ndoors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at\nthe far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in\nCircassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the\nmezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping\ncurves, all in blended marble from the world\'s greatest quarries, and\ndelicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,\ncenturies old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak\nceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid\nwith pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad\nhidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from\nburnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of\nhis imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion\nbefore this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had\nfaded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept\nremark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing\nnoiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a\ndoor below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is\nin panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now\nfrom here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,\ninstalled, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically\ncontrolled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give\nthe effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for\nsculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in\nAmerica.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,\nthree Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to\nknow that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed\nto-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand\ndollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"\nshe continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door\nof the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an\nopportunity later to show you the library.Great\ncarved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare\nvolumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step\nbehind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table\nthere for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little\nwaiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at\neach other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had\nseen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in\nits alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a\nstupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before\ntheir astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the\nAmes trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were\nmagnificently gowned.But Ames\'s massive form in its simple black\nand chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could\nnot suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great\ndelusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying\nthe man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the\nideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that\nthis country\'s youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,\nthink, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly\nused!Why, the cost of this single night\'s show would put two hundred\nmen like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,\nand train them to do life\'s work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned\nHaynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further\nopportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to\nshow him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don\'t, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he\ndiscovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his\npower, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn\'t the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,\nlooking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle\'s famous remark, as\nhe stood looking out across the London Strand: \'There are in this city\nsome four million people, mostly fools.\'How mean, narrow and hard\ntheir lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of\nmediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in\na generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight\nupon us.Ah, there\'s little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He\'s\nglorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to\ncoaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet\nstreet poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a\nyoung dandy of that day--\n\n                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He\'s an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at\nthem in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure\nthey\'re well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal\nhouse of England.I tell you, under\nthe splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of\nfashion seem to feel that the Creator didn\'t do a good job when He\ndesigned the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the\nheel is, so\'s to slant the foot and make comfortable walking\nimpossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and\ndeformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane\nthought.The human mind is a cave\nof black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng\nbelow."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,\nresplendent with diamonds."That\'s our eminent French guest, Madam\nCarot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by\nmeans of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,\nleaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,\nhastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her\ngowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy\nstory.See, she\'s drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a\nhusband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it\'s fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there\nbeyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,\nred-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling\nfor mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they\'re not married off\nproperly and into good social positions soon, it\'s mamma for the scrap\nheap!it\'s positively tragic to see these anxious mothers\nat Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing\nmadly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them\nfrom one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately\nland a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma\'s face if\nshe sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires\nheroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"\ntaking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how\'s your\nshorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive\nfigure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as\nfast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid\nbalcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through\nthe mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for\nher timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew\nenshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a\ngreat, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of\nhigh society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her\nboundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life\nthis sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious\nexhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,\nmagnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the\nsupreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last\nlay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant\'s lament that\nthere remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least\nknew that the man\'s herculean efforts to subdue the material world\nwere as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest\nof self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no\nsuch garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless\nworld.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly\nannounced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she\nhad come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and\nto the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the\ntheater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand\nspectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The\nAmes trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already\noccupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of\nfifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the\nfamous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself\nwas the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was\nlost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the\nlittle theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been\ncalled the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She\'ll cost\nhim not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see\nhere," drawing Carmen\'s attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle\nbesides!These stars get three thousand\ndollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering\naudience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was\nintroduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for\nadmittance at the portals of Carmen\'s mentality.In the bold challenge\nof the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the\nage-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the\nwondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,\nshe heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching\nvainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful\nDeschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell\ngloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of\na diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the\nmalignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human\nframe.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the\ndance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and\ndelicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and\ndance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,\nand ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the\nlifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final\ncurtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst\nfor the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"\n\n"Splendid, wasn\'t it?"came in tones of admiration from the social\nsecretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony\nbefore the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program\nin full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went\non."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,\nunabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in\na half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were\nbefore."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the\nlittle table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently\nfootsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through\nthe hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames\nand--who\'s with him?Showing him about, I\nsuppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she\nsaw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room\nat their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the\ndoor."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman\nnervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the\nman\'s repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering\nover at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen\nChinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I\'d make a\nhundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn\'t need to struggle with\nyour Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule\nwill be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked\nquizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been\nawaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said\nsuggestively.Ames, is committed to\nthe high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign\ncotton--"\n\n"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,\neh?""You don\'t seem to realize that in the\nend both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it\nwill come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his\nfinished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman\ntenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their\ncooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which\nyou have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant\nmanipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"\n\n"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious\nscruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for\nthe unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can\'t--"\n\n"H\'m," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an\napparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard\njust before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the\nMercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my\npersonal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe\nyou were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man\nout of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before\nhim and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and \'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His\nelection had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,\nexcepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had\nbeen for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been\nmatters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier\nand his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional\nhalls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his\nastonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own\ngratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the\nformal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,\nthe financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,\nand the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the\ngreat man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless\nWales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had\npenetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear\nsky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as\nhe stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy\nwith the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered\npenniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed\nto bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand\ndollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had\nbeen lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this\nis not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at\nAmes."Your name\'s on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the\nbook\'s been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you\'ve\nforgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He\ntook the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames\nand Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand\ndollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman\'s, and started\nwith him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,\n"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,\nabout that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure\nthat--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,\nleaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd\nexcitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and\ntell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew\nthe world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you\nand I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of\none who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our\nknowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for\nhimself and her, "he would ruin us!We had\nno intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I\nwould.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel\nto ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang\nto his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the\nscreen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young\ncompanions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their\nearnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of\nthe young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before\nsupper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily\nanswering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly\nrecognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved\nover Carmen\'s tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while\nher eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door\nis closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this\nhouse, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered\nand kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a\nlow--"\n\nHaynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her\nmouth."Hush, for God\'s sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,\n"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up\nand interposed."I can not put them out if they have his\npermission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,\nAmes himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week\'s Social Era was a corker.But,"\nstaring from Kathleen to the others, "what\'s the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,\ntrembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She\'s on business, and has my\npermission to remain.that\'s a good joke," winking at\nHaynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,\nold man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down\nKathleen\'s face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the\nhouse--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated\nKathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this\nwithout your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to\ndepart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,\nleading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he\nfaced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn\'t one\ndown there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon\nher shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he\ncontinued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and\nyou will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames\'s face."You mean Congressman--"\n\nThen he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her\ncompanion.Ames\'s expression\nof surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"\n\n"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender\ngirl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a\nloan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren\'t you?""You\nwill not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will\nyou?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as\nquiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And\nif I had not caught you when I did you would have written another\ninteresting article for the Social Era, wouldn\'t you?I\'ll\nbreak you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if\nyou dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"\n\n"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don\'t really want to,"\nsaid Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which\nyou people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn\'t it?"It doesn\'t really make any\ndifference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule\nis passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more\nthan you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his\nwife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of\nthose priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for\nyourself?--dollars that you can\'t spend, and that you won\'t let\nothers have?"During the girl\'s quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When\nshe concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the\nbalcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what\'s your\nprice?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted\nAmes.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will\ncrush him like a dirty spider!And you, I\'ll drag you through the\ngutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in\nwomanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting\ntoward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him\nfearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal\nmind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,\nsparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and\ngreed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter\nand fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present\nlife as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly\ninto it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few\nmoments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the\nnearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we\'re\nin for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will\nsave you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that\nHe can not save us both."CHAPTER 5\n\nON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns\nof the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the\nmagnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily\nin the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary\'s\nprobable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought\nout an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for\nan hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little\nwife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the\nwhole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the\nUniversity."But," she\nreflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous\nSaturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will\ngo to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real\nchild of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and\njealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again\nin the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third\nmeeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most\nmomentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but\nthe former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush\nwith Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her\nsustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to\nevil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one\nside."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you\nwill become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying\ndefeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"\n\n"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she\ndoesn\'t know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my\nreal self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was\nonly her own thought of me that she insulted.And such\na concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn\'t it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God\nconstitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit\nto the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to\ntake her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping\nfor order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at\nthe little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that\nanalytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover\nthe essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute\ntruth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our\nformer investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief\ncarries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be\nperfect, eternal, and self-existent.must\nthen receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He\nhas always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul\'s struggle to grasp\na statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting\nfriend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our\nprevious meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite\nobsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and\nbeautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,\npurifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our\nbelittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of\nwrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human\nceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for\nus, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the\nBeaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to\nwelcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not\nintruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,\nfirst; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that\nyou would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some\nlittle time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn\'t keep away\nfrom a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn\'t."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,\n"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two\ntheological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of\nreligious freedom, not a--"\n\n"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art\nof giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a\nlaugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at\nthe table."You--you didn\'t bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a\nglint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he\'s a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation\nof dead human beliefs, isn\'t he?But now listen, Father Waite is going\nto speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the\nmeeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite\ncontinued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And\nyet, according to Spencer\'s definition of reality, we must admit that\nthe universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which\nendures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as\nwe see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,\nmaturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things\nmaterial."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will\ncorroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the\ntremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually\ndisappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the\nworld\'s text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some\nseventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when\nit is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human\nconsciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately\ndisappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what\nthe universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this\ntopic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those\nscientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few\nelementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"\n\n"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the\nhuman standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a\nuniverse, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the\nphysical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us\nconsider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the\nforces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to\nconclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and\nthat polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the\nCreator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;\nhence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is\nit not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a\nmental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of\na continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly\nmental."We are accustomed to say,\nloosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in\nwhat does the process of seeing consist?What I\nreally mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,\nwe are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and\ncasts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is\nthrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the\nlittle rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which\nproject from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This\nvibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve\nto a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant\nof the chair out there, that\'s all.""Do you mean\nto say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and\ninvestigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the\nprocess of seeing?""Then all I\'ve got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most\nremarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he\nreplied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further\nand inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is\nabsolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so\nphysicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not\nvibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,\njust vibrations in the abstract.Now\nlet us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain\ncenter; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting\nthe arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair\noutside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such\ncrude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a\nuniverse of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,\n_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the\nbrain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning\nthe external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without\nthe brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them\ninto terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest\nform and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first\nlook at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions\nregarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_\nare material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend\nupon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that\nwill some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn\'t the mind look directly at\nthe chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through\nvibrations of bits of meat?Or isn\'t there any chair out there to look\nat?""Now you\'ve put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the\ncrudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind\ngets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,\nnor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical\nsense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the\nears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a\nlot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the\nmind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside\nauthority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that\nthe mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,\nand nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real\nmaterial objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,\nhearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other\nwords, _our own thoughts of things!"_\n\nA deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the\nconclusion of Hitt\'s words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence\nin the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the\nquestion of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own\nthoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,\nand calls the process\'seeing material objects in space.\'The mind as\nlittle needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of\nourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own\nmentalities."That\'s why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, \'The kingdom of heaven is\nwithin you.\'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates\nin matter, the lie about God?I tell you,\nthe existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world\ncomposed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and\nit is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed \'outer world\' is but our\ncollection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own\nconsciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the\nphysical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the\nphysical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must\nadmit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and\nsustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And\nyet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human\nsight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense\nmaterial.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of\nthought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly\nmental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that\'something\'\nwhich does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can\nthrow some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so\nput it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the\nrealm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:\n\n"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly\nmaterialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject\nof vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence\n_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we\nhave said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as\na particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be\ntorn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern\nphysical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should\nconsist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery\nof our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is\ncomposed of what are called \'electrons,\' and that these electrons are\nthemselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or\ntangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental\nthing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it\nnot?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is\nour comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he\nwent on:\n\n"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to\nform molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,\nmolecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,\nchairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we\nhave the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the\nconstitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held\ntogether by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or\nmental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,\ncomposed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can\nbelieve our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric\ncharges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without\ncolor, without extension, held together by law, and making up a\nmaterial object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From\nmillions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an\nobject, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest\ndeductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they\nhave experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have\nstated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been\nproven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical\ncharge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out\nover the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very\ncalculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the\'materialistic\ntheory\' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly\nconfined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no\nway material.It loses definiteness when \'practically\' applied to\nmaterial objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be\nregarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion\nto the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an\nastonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet\ngiven in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated\nthat the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible\nelectric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,\nwhere very complex formulas and coefficients are required for\ncorrecting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves\nwas said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further\nstated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there\ncould be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there\nare no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as\nwe dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not\nreceive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material\nsenses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own\nthoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our\nmentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get\nfarther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with\nthose which have less material structure, less material composition,\ntheir laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its\nultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which\nhave to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has\nbeen a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed \'laws of\nmatter.\'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist\ntells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has\nno such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and\ngoes to pieces.The decided\ntendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is\ncomposed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter\naccepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the\nether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so\nbelieved.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,\ngranting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,\nas we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the\nfinal analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the\nether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,\ninvisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at\nthe same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in\norder to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all\nconditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to\ncontinue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human\nmind\'s _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is\nthe way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human\nmentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of\nspirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts\nand ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying\nspace--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,\ncontaining life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible\nmistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused\nus all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the\nmind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"\n\n"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of\nall evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental\nconcept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,\n"let\'s get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I\'m a\nplain man, and I\'d like to know just where we\'ve landed.What have you\nsaid that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the\nsun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can\'t see that I can get\nalong with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous\nconclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,\nthat _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things\nmaterial seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis\nof all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the\nelements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading\nelement.That element is probably the ether, often called the\'mother\nof matter.\'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are\nnot elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the\nether.The so-called rare elements are\nrare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and\nchange into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.\'Atoms\nare but fleeting phases of matter,\' we are told.They are by no means\neternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that\n\'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.\'Simply that \'visible matter and invisible ether are\none and the same thing.\'But to the five so-called physical senses the\nether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly\nincomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that\nwe call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind\'s\ninterpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent\n_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to\nwhom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether\nis _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not\ndeny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to\nsubserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It\nis wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes\ncognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily\nrecognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether\nthere could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material\nuniverse depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five\nphysical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information\nwhatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen\'s statement,\nnamely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are\nmental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of\nsense--"\n\n"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes\nare destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human\nmind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs\nin the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material\nmodes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its\nerroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,\nand dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind\nhas made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of\nflesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the\nhuman mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its\nmental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye\nbe destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon\nthe material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is\ngone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares\nas truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human\nmind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to\nthese beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them\nexternalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its\nuniverse.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that\nthe human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five\nphysical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the\nether.it is but a theory which we find necessary\nfor any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a\nmaterial basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his\nprotest by means of emphatic gestures.You\ntell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit\nit, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the\nuniverse is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of\nastronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say\nthat the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but\none creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs\nbe an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be\nmind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely\nperfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a\nhouse divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the\nexpression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here\'s the\nsticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind\nwhich it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole\npretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a\nperplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the\nlittle group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,\n"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human\nreasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,\nthrough it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting\nground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can\nrise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is\nmental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher\nMill said, \'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious\'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd\'s rising\nprotest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which\nI call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my\nmind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought\nresulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental\nactivity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to\nyour great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of\ncharges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high\nrate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious\nonly of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,\nafter all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;\nI had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was\nconscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;\nwhen I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If\nthe book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious\nof a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the\nhuman mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And\nyet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you\'ve called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is\ndirected to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if\nhearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it\nincessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it\nnow when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is\ndirected to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they\ntake place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,\nthat we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our\nminds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our\nworld, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The\nuniverse that we think we see all about us consists of the mental\nconcepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the\nexposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,\nare they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and\ndeath, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can\nreason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have\nagreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This\ninfinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,\nthat is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas\nand thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the\ninfinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of\nideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any\nelements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of\nthe creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the\nnever-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God\ncreated the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must\nremember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were\nlargely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to\nexpress wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in\nGenesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological\ninterpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite\ncreative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never\ncease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or\nunfoldment of infinite mind\'s ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in\nwhich to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find\nthat all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas\nof infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the\ngreatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It\nis the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That\nidea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of\nman."That\'s quite a different proposition from\nthe mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of\nGod.But then they would not be\'mud-men.\'Now I have just spoken of\nthe real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in\nthe first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,\nunfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.\'In the\nbeginning,\' says the commentator.That is, \'To begin with--God.\'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative\nprinciple, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it\nnecessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over\nagain, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of\nGenesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of\ntruth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains\nthat the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl\ngently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He\nis a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are\nseen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the\ndirect antithesis of God\'s thought.It is\nthe supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the\nearth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy\nopposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim\nall his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we\nhave seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort\nof mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe\nare in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,\npassing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the\n\'old man\' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and\nby knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and\nuniverse.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of\nGod, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole\nscheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how\nfutile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole\ntheological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,\ntheir insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how\nbelittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn\nunbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,\nwho creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,\nsorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway\nover the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in\nthought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I\nsee beyond is--"\n\nCarmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That\ninfinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human\nbeings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would\nhave convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer\nslowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole\nbasis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your\nsalvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be\nsaved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical\nchange of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That\nthe entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,\nthat the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in\nwitchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are\nwholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great\nscientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can\'t revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,\nand dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can\ndo so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love\nwhich she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I\'ll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a\nwhisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6\n\n\nThe Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every\nSaturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their\njaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the\nfollowing Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting\na report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the\nscene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the\nslender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood\nbefore him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in\nconsequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to\nwrite during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had\nread it through three times, and each time had read into it a new\nmeaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at\nleast, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments\nadmitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the\nsocial system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of\na powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a\nprediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she\nwrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love\nstopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it\nrested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that\nthe essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers\nafter truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her\nskillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its\nconstituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought\nin.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread\nover his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier\ndeclared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd\nbegan to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office\nboy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of\nthem, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd\'s mind.He rose and went\nto the card-index to consult his subscription list.He\nstood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked\nout upon a fire-escape.He turned\nand rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual\ncarelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not\nthere.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office\nboy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a\ndream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some\nfifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a\nyear--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his\nultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw\nit all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer\nsun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and\nHaynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the\nencounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire\nsubscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he\nhad caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen\nand I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited\nman\'s arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of\nit; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;\nand Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly\nthat it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let\nus get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University\ndepartments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation\nwith the distracted publisher."Here I waste my\nevenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and\nmeantime, while we\'re figuring out that there is no evil, that\nmonster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine\npractical discussions we\'ve been having, ain\'t they?I tell you, I\'m\nthrough with \'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a\ncrash."Ned," said Hitt, "you\'re a fool."Here I had a nice, clean\nbusiness, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you\nand that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,\ndoesn\'t it?"H\'m; well, Ned, you\'re not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"\nreplied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of\nepithets, I\'ll supply a few!I\'m a--"\n\nThe door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and\npanting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men\nfollowed me all the way down from the University!They watched me\ncome in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and\nlooked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"\n\n"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that\'s all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he\nbriefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And\nnow," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned\nsaw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving\nhis arms about."What do you--"\n\n"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did\nyou tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the\npicture of despair.It was the first time\nshe had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because\nit isn\'t fit for you, and because you\'ve been awakened.You are for\nhigher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the\nSocial Era.I knew you just couldn\'t stay at this work.You have got\nto go up--"\n\n"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I\'ve gone up,\nnicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn\'t speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it\'s in dollars and\ncents!""And that\'s why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The\ngirl\'s right, I guess.You\'ve stagnated here long enough, Ned.There\'s\nno such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there\nis no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I\'ve seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply\ntremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real\nnews; let him work, not for rich people\'s money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it\nhas been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean\njournalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for\nothers.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the\nconfident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the\ngirl\'s words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one\nwho had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the\nsame thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from\nmaterial ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt\'s eyes widened with his expanding\nthought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he\ncontinued, speaking rapidly."It\'s a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;\nhas no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of\nhis shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question\nstartled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to\nHaynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot\nof junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and\neverything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I\'m not a rich man, as\nwealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in\nOhio.It isn\'t the money--it\'s--it\'s what\'s back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she\nwhispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I\'ve pondered and studied this scheme for a year,\nbut I\'ve only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,\ndriving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a\nspiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material\nobstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of\nhis chair, "rouse up!Now I\'ll \'phone Carlson\nright away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,\nas a comprehension of Hitt\'s plan dawned upon his waking thought, he\nstraightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up\nof his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd\'s cheeks, as the tension in\nhis nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you\nstanding there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining\nroom of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly\nconcerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had\nreceived that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,\nand that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong\nfriend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt\ntook the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced\nregarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we\nmortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with\nphenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate\ncauses.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of\nappearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind\nknows nothing.A phenomenon may be\nso-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we\ncan not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, \'Every one\nof the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is\ndemonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something\nbeyond the relative.\'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the \'Theory\nof suppositional opposites\'", replied Hitt."It means that to every\nreality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there\nmay be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great\nphilosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of\nappearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of\nwhich they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that\n\'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests\na negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,\nthough these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is\nreal_.\'For, interpreted, it means: we\nmust deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order\nto see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the\neffect of the speaker\'s words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus\nsay that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that\nappears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second\nchapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is\nnothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out\nof dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we\nconsider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the\nconclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First\nCause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That\nCause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real\nexistence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,\nits negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human\nexistence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the\ngreat First Cause\'s opposite.They are a reflection of that\nsupposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but\nphenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real\nsubstance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,\nphenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our\nknowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._\n\n"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on\nReverend Moore\'s face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal\nexistence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these\nis entirely mental.These thoughts, such\nas feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the\nfive physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the \'pathetic\nfallacy.\'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent\nupon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only\nthe absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure\neternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"\nwent on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive\nas real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of\nobjects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only\nthoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of\nhardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something\nthat is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the\ninfinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so\non, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,\nmountains, and other objects, are but\'relative realities,\' pointing\nto the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and\nthoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his\nstatements.Then he resumed:\n\n"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental\nconcept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real\nsubstance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct\nopposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our\nconcept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought\nbrings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding\nunreality_.If the infinite creative\nmind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then\nevil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought\nwhich entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must\nitself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as\nJesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine\nor human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply\ngoes to show, as Burke puts it, \'what shadows we are and what shadows\nwe pursue.\'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it\nwill accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive\nto truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck\nvoiced a mighty fact when he said, \'Function precedes structure.\'For\nby that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird\nthe egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief\nthat physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a\n_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude\nbelief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from\nsuch slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were\ncutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick\'s mind and thought,\nbut his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind\'s\nactivity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam\nengine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;\nthe bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls\na slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its\nphysical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can\ncling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on\nany real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false\nthought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just\nwhat is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it\nis already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the\ntremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,\nsince the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as\nregards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such\nthing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing\nas absolute creation_!The shadow\nnever was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,\nor revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always\nexisted, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it\nincludes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,\nand death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be\nremoved, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a\nreversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,\nwhich is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the\nsuppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been\nutterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists\nhave at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of\nmatter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not\noperate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject\nto the human mind\'s so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is\nutterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a\nmanifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that\nmatter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,\nand that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The\nelectron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of\npositive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only\nnegative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of\nonly negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the\n_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of\nenergy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the\ninfinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,\nby reason of what has been called \'the law of suppositional\nopposites,\' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of\nradiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be\nexerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of\nmotion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action\nand reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action\nwithout a resultant negative one.The divine\nmind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and\nbodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The\nentire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental\nconcept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its\nconcomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes\naway--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the\nso-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical\napplication which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused\nafter his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the\nmaterial is the relative.But,\nthat being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is\nlikewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely\nimpossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two\nequals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely\nexcept as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what\nprinciple governs an error, whether that error be in music,\nmathematics, or life conduct?"And that\nis why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I\nhave come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If\ninfinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all\nthat really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must\nlikewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this\nopposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must\nsimulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual\nman, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite\nmust present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to\nthe reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that\nwe, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as\nhuman beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,\nfeel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that\ncomes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional\nactivity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of\nthings.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to\nquestion the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as\nknowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of\ntruth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,\ndecay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness\nforms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It\nmakes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey\nthese false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human\nconsciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment\nwhich the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,\nis a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis\nof real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,\nand forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes\nitself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms\ninto a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the\nmind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"\n\n"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have\nwhat Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the \'externalization of\nthought.\'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, \'As\na man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and\nbecomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at\nonce to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency\nfor us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or\nenvironment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such\nthought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already\nsaid.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should\nchange constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the\nreal.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human\nconcept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is\nnever fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,\nthose elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,\ngreed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until\ntruth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent\nwork there, the work of denying and tearing down the false\nthought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters\nthe human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human\nconsciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to\ngive way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the \'old man\'\nand put on the \'new.\'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical\nsenses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and\noriginal sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as \'fallen man,\' my friend," said Hitt\nquietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,\nof the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle\nremains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection\nto lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly\nsympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer\nwithhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there\nare so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of\nChristianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend\nthe great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I\nam moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been\ncrucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would\nresurrect him!Don\'t you think you have kept him in the tomb long\nenough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless\nburial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And\nbecause of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk\nfrom the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the\nplace of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and\nwhich, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises\nthe dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was\nconsumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second\ncoming of Christ would occur when the \'old man\' was put off.We have\nbeen discussing the \'old man\' to-night, and showing how he may be put\noff.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be\ndone?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock\nfor the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a\nsuppositional future.\'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,\' says\nthe infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"\nretorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should\naccept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted\nout, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and\nreligion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the\nissue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is\nan awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm\nof shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus\nsaid: \'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no\nsubstantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence\nabsolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.\'And do you really think he looked upon\nevil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his\nteachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all\ntogether."It\'s an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn\'t going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the\nminister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It\'s your duty to save\nus if we\'re in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By\nthe way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for\nGrand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune\nwas now so immense that I couldn\'t possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his\nface, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn\'t be happy if I made people pay to hear\nme sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she\nlaunched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise\nhis glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7\n\n\nMan reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from\ndependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the\nwisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never\ndid she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of\njudgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her\nstanding boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through\ninstinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that\nhe who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office\nof the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,\neagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no\nqualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt\nand fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the\npoint of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion\'s dismal\nforebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn\'t sell," Haynerd was saying\nas the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he\nwould."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she\nsaid, "you remind me of Lot\'s wife.She was told to go ahead, along\nthe right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being\nstarted right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt\ntears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don\'t\nvoice a single fear to me!You couldn\'t make me believe them true even\nif you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness\nnow.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a\nlittle cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and\nwithout any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don\'t\never go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and\ngibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will\nhurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is\nbound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their\nfears.""I guess we\'ll find\nourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in\nthis great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much\nanimal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the\npress is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don\'t you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is\na deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by\nso-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,\nby commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite\nyour heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for\nrighteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have\nbeen debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson\'s decision, I\nhave been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with\nfear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,\nconstructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand\nopportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental\nsuggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from\nthose who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument\nabout the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set\nout to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with\nfour managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their\nviewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to\nmeet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd\'s jaw dropped as he\ngazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but\nnever would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just\ndone."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a\nhuman invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In\nthe yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the\ntragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental\nlaws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper\'s\nalmost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only\nlaughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people\nalive to what was going on about them.He couldn\'t see that he was\nmaking a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so\nconstantly before an ignorant, credulous world\'s eyes that little else\ncould be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports\nhad no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would\nhave dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said\nhe had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He\nwas in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he\nwanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian\nwife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first\npage.Or has\nhe further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice\nseemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the\npress were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly\ndestruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and\nsanctum: \'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife\'s throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be\nadmitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his\nyellow journal avidly, and--"\n\n"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as\nyou call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system\never devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of\ncommercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his\njaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial\nstimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied\nthought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little\nthat is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and\nyellow journalism do.Hitt--can\'t you, Ned--that\nthe world\'s cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that\nwill make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man\nfeels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad\nrush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to\nrest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately\ntired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a\npromised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve\nhis problems.Little beyond a recount\nof his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and\naccounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and\ncan not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and\ngive him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him\nsunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing\nconditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,\nof course.This steam-calliope\nage reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own\nunsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness\nand dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;\nby the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that\ninsult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow\njournalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling\ntales.But the publisher himself--well, he\nbattens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading\nsocial system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can\'t," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn\'t\npay--doesn\'t--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably\nfailed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment\'s reflection, "oil will\nmeet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the\nExpress will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting\npurveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that\ntaste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its\nadvertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and\ndrugs.""And now we\'ve got to get right down to\nbusiness.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express\none more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny\nmorning daily.I\'m going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as\nmy first assistant."But, first, how far may\nI go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my\nbrain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am\nprepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express\nbefore a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We\'ll see how it works, for I have some\nideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for\n_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;\nand to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious\nsectarianism--you\'ll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be\nan active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,\ntireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,\n"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already\nsucceeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes\nno difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of\ndifference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we\nclaim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that\nthey are divinely ours.Lot\'s wife didn\'t have the sort of confidence\nthat wins--she looked back.But\nthere is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in\nus to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding\nthe Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth\nflashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have\nwithin us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the\nknowledge of infinite mind\'s omnipotence, and our ability to use the\nChrist-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt\nsmiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:\n\n"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren\'t\nwe?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind\'s\nerrors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new\nis _good_.Adams\'s office two\nitems came in over the \'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,\nand the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of\nsubmerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity\nto those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on\nthe front page?I was unable to locate the latter\nanywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of\nthe Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the\nweek, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening\neditorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the\nselection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best\npractical education for the people.This was John Ruskin\'s idea, and\ncertainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will\nstand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up\nand regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of\nthe women.And India proves that\nbackward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women\'s Department in the\nExpress, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving\nthem every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,\nthe languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is\ngoing to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a\nlecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model\ncity for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for\neverybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for\nworkingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and\nhave social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to\nestablish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for\ncivic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"\n\nBy this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at\nthe girl."Aren\'t you wandering\nsomewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven\'t I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only\nthing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_\nnews--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to\nbe alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl\'s infectious enthusiasm, and his face was\nbeaming."It\'s your unlimited thought, Carmen, that\nwe old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real\nservice to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make\nmoney!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of\ngood.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there\nis_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl\'s\nwords; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless\nenthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they\nceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was\nalready beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer\ndefinition of \'news\' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant\nof the Express, and meet its staff."There\'s a question I\'d like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued\ntheir way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our\neditorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters\nand spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned\nCarmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the\nExpress.Hitt\'s spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen\nseemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of\nthe dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing\nabout this is that we don\'t have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of\nhis plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,\naddressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I\'ll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor\'s\nsummons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling\nthat so young a man should be regarded as Carlson\'s best news\ngatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as\nMr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and\naddressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something\nof his father\'s terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I\nlet him write little articles for the Express when he was barely\nsixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up\nin some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,\nI guess.But since his family troubles he\'s been on the straight road\nto the insane asylum."His father is no\nfriend of mine, and--"\n\n"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a\n_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is\nwoman\'s era, isn\'t it?"*       *       *       *       *\n\nA week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh\ntype and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written\neditorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already\ncrowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and\nlaughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and\nwondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw\nit into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the\neditorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a\ncareful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the\nfeminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read\nthe article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was\nwell written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper\nto his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me\nor my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,\nnominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing\nforward and clasping the financier\'s hand."The city council last\nnight voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very\nintelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They\'re wise enough to see that\ntheir jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,\nClaus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have\nlearned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales\nless than last month," he remarked dryly."It\'s the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer\napologetically."Them women--"\n\n"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don\'t know\nhow to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you\'ve got to encourage\nthe young people more.We\'ve got to get the girls and boys.If we get\nthe girls, we\'ll get the boys easily enough.It\'s the same in the\nliquor business as in certain others, Claus, you\'ve got to land them\nyoung."Ames, I can\'t take \'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had\nnothing else to do I\'d just like to devote myself to the sales end of\nthe brewing business.I\'d use mental suggestion in such a way through\nadvertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain\nbeer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a\nfood, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has\ngreater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers\nthat way.Don\'t call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like\nthat.Why, we couldn\'t begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;\nboards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;\nelectric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,\ndid you?And samples--why, I\'d put samples into every house in the\nUnion!I\'d give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred\nmillion as a result!But I\'d work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they\'re more receptive\nthan adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,\nClaus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can\nafford to pass it up.It\'s run by a college professor and a doll-faced\ngirl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers\nof the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city\npapers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then\nthe rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the\nExpress may--"\n\n"Humph!"An example, backed by\nabsolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers\nof the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly\nignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in\nthe city.It\'s in every hotel, in every\nsaloon, in every store and business house here.It\nisn\'t sold, it\'s given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I\'ll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the\ndining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted\ndiscussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without\nsome reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and\nanother friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these\nunique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I\'ve tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the\nlatter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he\nsays he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He\'s a Philistine, that\'s all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward\nHull, who says--"\n\n"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the\nplastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn\'t want to lose\nthe sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on\nhim.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,\ndoesn\'t he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for\nwe\'ve sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented\nhim by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The\nhour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to\ncover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien\'s."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I\nlooked often and long through the window and out over this great,\nroaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and\nnerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling\nupward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The\nincessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and\ndust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and\nyet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual\nnature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the\nstreets below.And I saw,\ntoo, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in\ntheir automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical\nwell-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they\nwish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and\ndeath will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced\nyour philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to\nMorton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he\n_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek\nfirst the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,\noh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional\nphysical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere\nand everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real\nknowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human\nexistence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his\nvicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe\non his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after\ndeath.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they\nthemselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is\nnot bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,\nexternalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their\ndependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox\ntheology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our\nday think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at\nall upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their\ncomfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend\nthem, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and\nthen sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does\nnot want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the\nlight of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has\naccepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,\nmy friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous\nmaterial activity.And its inertia is the result of its own\nself-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as\nBalfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except\nthat of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious\nbeliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that\ngentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp\nfeatures."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad\ndesire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the\nhuman mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that\'s true,"\ninterposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France\nput God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as\nthe goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of\nParis, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical\nscience, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the\nfrontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, \'Once\nman was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a\ncandlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.\'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of\nhis falling away from the Church--"\n\n"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because\nhe could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology\nhas largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror\nof being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,\nso-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up\nin a congregation and sing \'My Jesus, I love Thee,\' and \'In\nmansions of glory and endless delight.\'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow\nand next month\'s rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the\nweaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,\npoor fool!Well, how\noften nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at\nreceptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that\nreligion \'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.\'It\nstands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,\nand the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,\nwe still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is\nthe most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk\nto us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to\nus about business?But religion is far, far less important to\nhuman thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and\nincreased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a\ngodless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The\nworld\'s acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact\nthat the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only\naction is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made\nsome startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is\na First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon\nthat, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that\nthere can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise\nthat there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal\nmind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is\nGod.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him\nand His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all\nthings are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are\nforced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with\n_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything\nis mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that\ngentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a\ntremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the\nso-called \'theory of suppositional opposites.\'We have settled to our\nsatisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent\nupon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really\ndependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That\'something\' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that\nthe only thing that can be verified about God is that He is \'the\neternal power that makes for righteousness.\'Very well, we are almost\nwilling to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence\nfor good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of\nright-thinking.So it makes Him\nthe sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very\nnecessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are\nconducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,\nevolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,\nuncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that\nincludes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was\'made\'--revealed, manifested--in\nHis image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,\nincluding real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as\nwe regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,\nnamely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in\nunreality_.The magnet has\nits opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the\nworld\'s morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs\nfrom the soil of a Roman Emperor\'s blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of\nmathematical problems.That\nwhich stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with\nSpencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as\nthe opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that\nit is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It\nhas its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings\nand animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in\nfact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal\nmind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this\ncommunal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,\nand will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly\nevolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its\nfirmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that\nmanifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of\ntime, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold\ngenerations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it\nbegan to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind\nthat is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine\nmind, if I may so express it.But\ntypes that were without basis of principle, and so they passed\naway--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came\ninto the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the\nAramaic word which Jesus used, translated \'_hamartio_,\' which means\n\'missing the mark.\'Yes, sin came through Adam, for\nAdam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of\ntime.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher\ntype.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real\nknowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He\nprobably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead\nafter the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after\nthe lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a\nbelief.This: the mortal mind was translating the\ndivine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human\nhistory.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the\nmist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the\ninfluence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the\nmortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people\nwho best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called\nthemselves the \'chosen\' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen\nhas expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than\nthe others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,\nyou know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began\nto record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God\nmanifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty\nbook, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in\nthe human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking\nabout _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me\nto-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind\nthat is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal\nmortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and\nideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped\ntheir moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses\nthat he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the\nrest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of\nGenesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of\nany mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the\nsecond chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began\nto talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second\nand third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite\nso, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then\nattempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the\norigin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the\nsecond chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny\nthat man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for\ndenying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years\nago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most\nanimals.Snakes developed in the\nSilurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening\nstretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for\nthe second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of\nGenesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by\nvarious authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic\nhand and mind than Moses\'s composed that second chapter.However that\nmay be, it is a splendid example of the human mind\'s crude attempt to\ninterpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a\nway represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the\nspiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it\nmust inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it\nmust meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a\nknowledge of the infinite principle involved.That\'s why the world\nrejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,\nsnake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You\'re like a\nstory-book!"We know that man appeared on this\nearth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of\nyears before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that\nwe are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But\nremember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal\nmortal mind.It has been dying from\nthe very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence\nalone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have\nbeen evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest\nit, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they\nevolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so\nit and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to\nsay, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called\nmind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the\nprinciple which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,\ntranslated \'_hamartio_,\' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that\nswam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind\'s sin,\nand died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not\nmanifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,\nso-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms\nof existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally\nwithout basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that\neverything material contains within itself the elements for its own\ndestruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with\nthe highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,\ntoo, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of\nexistence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of\nmaterial consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification\nand placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of\ntime.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,\nideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or\nsupposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is\nessentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to\nmaterial things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly\nbody; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes\nfurther, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,\neach having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each\ncapable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it\ncan be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs\nfor its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their\nexpense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God\nis infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,\ncalamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it\nconstantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone\nto-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness\nalways refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human\nmind still translates or interprets God\'s greatest idea, Man, as \'a\nsuffering, sinning, troubled creature,\' forgetting that this creature\nis only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at\nits own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God\'s\nreal thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to\ngrasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be\nmade to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the\nreal man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now\nenough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to\nenable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no\nexcuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn\'t\nhave known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don\'t see that\nwe mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations\nby the mortal mind of infinite mind\'s idea of itself, Man.These\ninterpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited\nthere.All are false,\nand doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with\nsuperciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical\nclass?"Carmen\'s thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence\nof Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting\nsands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under\nthe influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that\nis made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,\nmortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower\nstratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry\nover into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him\nyesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested\nin his present or future.Then, opening\nhimself to truth, he lays off the \'old man\' and puts on the \'new.\'He\ndenies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality\nof the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible\nreservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His\nthoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new\ninterpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,\ndo you think they are manufacturing new thought?They\nare but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind\'s\ninterpretations of God\'s innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our\ninterpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to\nrighteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts\nabout God\'s ideas.But the human mind\nmakes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall\nsolve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His\nthoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned\nor accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from\nthe communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain\nerroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,\nand invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the\'set,\'\nthere would be a very different and better resulting externalization\nin health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true\nmission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,\nwhen we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will\nfind ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby\ntruly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have\nsaid in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the\nphysical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material\nbasis and turn into vibrations, and\'man changes with velocity\' of\nthese.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,\neons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as\nI have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and\nfluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most\ncertainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said\nthat \'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.\'Spencer has\ndefined life as the \'continuous adjustment of internal to external\nrelations.\'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The\nhuman mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles\nincessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the\nstruggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a\ncontinuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state\nof ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human\nmind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a\nself-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,\nand its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly\npushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states\nare becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice\nversa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician\ntold me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now\ncould be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger\nproduce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of\n_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in\neffect is the thought lying back of each.""You don\'t pretend that the snake\nthinks and hates--"\n\n"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human\nrace has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is\nit any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects\nback that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred\nwill make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,\nremorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes\nfrom the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human\nperspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that\nin a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous\nperspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do\nyou know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such\ndeadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a\nhuman being?Think what the Church\'s deadly hatred of so-called\nheretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions\nhave been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper\nman requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying\nthe floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been\nfilling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them\nout.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report\non those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was\nan historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters\nlittle whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man\nJesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,\nand always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that\nconcerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son\nof God, and your remarks concerning him are--"\n\n"Slow up, Pat!""I\'ll fight that out with\nyou on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she\nsqueezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,\nwith the melody of the girl\'s voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8\n\n\nFor several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which\nhe was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful\npace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the\nnear future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed\nnever to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun\nthe introduction of innovations that were startling and even\nmirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic\nfield.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the\npublic taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source\nof income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her\ncrippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary\nassistance.Haynerd\'s few thousands were long\nsince dissipated.And\nher estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,\nin such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that\nshe might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its\npromoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see\nagain the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his\nmountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly\nfaced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why\nhad he let her escape him then?True, women had\nmeant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had\nseemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He\nknew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in\nhim, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she\nhad swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down\nthe receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:\n\n"You didn\'t want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first\nplace, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not\naccustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came\ncringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I\'m very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one\nwas there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his\nchair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful\nnight in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at\nbest--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall\nclock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled\ncasually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme\nconfidence in his own powers.And\nthe knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met\nand conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that\nthought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real\nnovelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air\nof prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally\ncommented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,\nand cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He\nfirst walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions\nprevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a\nhalt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the\nglass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and\nits walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung\nabout them.At the desk, bending\nover a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don\'t mind if I finish\nthis article, do you?""It\'s got\nto go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don\'t stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want\nyour undivided attention.""Oh, you\'re sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,\nalthough the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that\nshe always seemed to be a better woman in this girl\'s presence.Could he go on persecuting the\nharassed woman?But he wouldn\'t, if--\n\n"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of\nrelief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the\nboy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:\n\n"You\'ve come to apologize, haven\'t you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he\ncame in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn\'t vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything\'s all right, isn\'t it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger\nrising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of\ncommittee an hour ago.Here\'s the wire,\nshowing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his\nfeatures he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all\ntime, isn\'t it?"Then:\n\n"Rather odd, isn\'t it?"he commented, turning quite away from that\nsubject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you\nprofess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so\npractical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she\nanswered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be\nconducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there\nwas no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the\nlook.Well, I\'ll wager you won\'t get a dollar back on your investment\nfor years."We are not measuring our profits\nin money!""And your investment--let\'s see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You\'ve put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I\'ll tell you," she said, "because money is the only\nmeasure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has\nput more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can\nnever, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide\nworld, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don\'t owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe\nMadam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who\nhave given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for\nthe life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for\nthe souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human\nwreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd\nfor the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had\nfinished, and they sat looking squarely into each other\'s eyes, the\nsilence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning\nand the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus\naddressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled\nhim.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting\nabove the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she\nquietly said.Don\'t threaten, please," she\ncontinued."It wouldn\'t do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames\'s mouth.Then he twitched his\nshoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of\nnonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the\nwall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:\n\n               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,\n               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You\'ll find no scepter like the pen\n               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read\nthe one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition\nfrom Bryant:\n\n          "Leave the vain, low strife\n          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--\n          The passions and the cares that wither life,\n          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the\nreal handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that\nsome day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some\nuncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of\nher words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the\nsecond motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,\neh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering\nupon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods\nbelong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it\nwearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil\nwhich must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he\nasked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn\nmuck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It\nis I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a\nmoment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy\nwith your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you\nare declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when\nyou are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at\nany price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over\nhere this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil\nalways finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who\'s your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and\nlaughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_\nmuch.Now let\'s see if we can\'t get\ntogether on terms of peace.The world hasn\'t used you right, and I\ndon\'t blame you for being at odds with it.I\'ve wanted to talk with\nyou about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous\nand tried to kill you.But, if you\'ll just say the word, I\'ll set you\nright up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I\'ll take you\nby the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of \'em, and\nknock \'em over right and left!I\'ll make you the leading woman of the\ncity; I\'ll back the Express; we\'ll make it the biggest newspaper in\nthe country; I\'ll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I\'ll\nput you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he\nconcluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,\nwinning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I\'ll join you," she\nsaid, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the\ncross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he\ncoarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an\nilluminating essay on my conversation."The man\'s facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he\nretained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably\nhas not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly\nwithout excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy\nsheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports\nof the world\'s vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack\nof interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally\nfailed.But, say the word,\nand--"\n\n"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions\nby taking advantage of the world\'s inhuman and pernicious social\nsystem can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your\nthought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into\nthe dust.As for your money--"\n\n"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates\nwith it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and\ntheirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,\nMr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I\nmust return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender\nform in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall\nupon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She\nstood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile\ninto which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out\nquite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in\nthat woman\'s lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for\nyou.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter\nsqueeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven\'t anything more\nto occupy you than fear, you\'d better come down to the office, and\nI\'ll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"\n\n"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,\nthat has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it\nbeen given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which\nwill result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would\nwant to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then\nGod\'s law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there\'s the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don\'t\nwant you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that\nHaynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don\'t worry,\ndearest; I--I won\'t go alone."A moment later she gave the\nBeaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she\nstood at Haynerd\'s desk."Here I\nam, tied down, depending on Sid, and he\'s drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the\nEast Side.Here\'s the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open\nmeeting, I\'m told; but I suspect it\'s an I. W. W. affair.he\nsaid, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at\nAvon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That\'s what this\nmeeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands\nsuddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor\'s office and sank heavily into a\nchair."Look here," he said, in\nsudden desperation, "that fellow\'s got to be sobered up, now!Or\nelse--"\n\nAnother call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the\naddress over the \'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his\nshoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it\'s up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,\ntaking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her\nown little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to\nthe limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside\nit."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the\nhabit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear\nnow."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the\nlinotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went\nhurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a\nbeaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen\'s little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And\nas the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she\nthanked her God that the lad\'s true individuality was His pure\nthought of him.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little\nroom, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A\ngentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return\nof his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed\nabout the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven\'t sat\nhere--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a\nflood of bitter tears."It isn\'t real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen\nstroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love\nand pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,\nstruggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her\nback against it, facing him.she cried, holding her\nhands against him._God reigns\nhere!_"\n\nShe turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,\ntrembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending\nover the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can\'t," he moaned; "you can\'t--I\'m _gone!_" His voice died into a\ntremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief\nlife-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and\nknew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes\nof her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall\ntheir faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and\ncritical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith\nby her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am\nGod!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her\nshoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to\nwitness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,\nthis heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the\nChrist and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,\nand a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been\nupon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are\nright, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create \'new\nheavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor\ncome into mind\'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and\nyou have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and\nyou find that you haven\'t sunk at all, and that you couldn\'t possibly\nget away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to\nitself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,\nSidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of\nspiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you\nthink you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don\'t understand--"\n\n"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help\nyou," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn\'t only whiskey--it\'s--" his head sank again--"it\'s--morphine!"It\'s got the false thought that seems to call itself \'you,\'" she\nsaid.We\'ll\ncling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I\nsaid, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn\'t be\nwhere I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now\nright where you belong, in Him.My\nparents didn\'t teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,\nmy father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I\'ll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what\nlove will do.""My father--it\'s his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up\nand struggling to rise.It\'s his fault\nthat I\'m a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and\nshaking nerves.You don\'t hate your father; the hate is against your\nthought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still\ndwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have\nsaved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it\nwasn\'t.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the\ncity, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back\nhome, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But\nshe realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing\nhis very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the\nhidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the\ngutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come\nand work for him.And so I went to a\ndoctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to\nsober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and\nsober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"\n\nHe stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder\nas he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted\nit painfully."I am not\nafraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you\nare searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it\nto you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far\nthan the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,\nand you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he\nsank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We\ndon\'t have to struggle--we don\'t have to fight--we only have to\n_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that\nthere is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there\nis such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There\nis nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that\'s all, Sidney," she went on, as he became\ncalmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,\nin my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked\neagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to\nresist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just\nhow pressing your need is.I know how\nawfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to\ntake you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right\nunder my thought.I\'m going to be the mirror, constantly with you,\nthat reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don\'t think of anything\nelse now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to\nthe door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem\nis solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I\'ve\nkept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We\'ll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *\n\nBut at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that\nCarmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don\'t\nknow how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I\nnever saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn\'t\ninterfere.We\'re going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep\nthere.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I\nknow," he said, in reply to Hitt\'s explanation."That boy\'s life is\nmore to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the\nuniverse just at present.The devil can\'t look her in the\nface!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human\nfear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted\nheaven-high, and fell again.As the\nnight-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a\ndeep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little\nparlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to\nthe latter.And now," she continued, "you must\nwork with me, and stand--firm!Sidney\'s enemies are those of his own\nmental household.We have got to\nuproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a\npower.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a\nsense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven\nout, too.It is all mental, every\nbit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going\nto prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming\nthings."But," she added, after a moment\'s pause, "you must not watch this\nerror so closely that it can\'t get away.For if\nyou do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"\n\n"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We\nknow that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"\n\n"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put\naway your \'ifs\' and \'buts.\'"And these," he said, holding out the\nneedle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9\n\n\nFour weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,\nstupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little\nporch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most\nof the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted\nmight be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have\nguessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of\ngold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have\nbeen read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly\ntoward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,\nthose black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined\nto break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,\ndrink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his\nnostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,\nher arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils\nwithin him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug\nwhich had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured\nfrom his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,\nfreezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with\nCarmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts\nand ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to\nawake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,\nunharmed!--\n\nAnd then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at\nfirst, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,\nthunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,\nnever to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of\njoy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,\ntoo--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of\nthe world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor\nof her love, she had stood at this struggling lad\'s side, meeting the\narrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had\nsat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting\nthe terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had\ndone in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself\nknew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a\nnew mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung\nway.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought\nwas busy with the boy\'s future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed\nto lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon\nhim, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope\nwas pushing its way.The last tie which\nbound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks\nbefore, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother\'s brilliant\npath.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from\nabroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social\nwarfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband\'s\nconsuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which\nseized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she\nslowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering\nattack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the\nAmes palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain\ndesires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone\nto face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was\nrumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the\nrustle of the death angel\'s wings beside her, a great terror had\nstricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had\nnever cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her\nhusband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with\nhim to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that\nshe had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as\nshe lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,\nin soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of\nthis life\'s mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of\nCarmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no\none knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who\ncould gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty\nleader of the great city\'s aristocracy had passed from this life into\nthe darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother\'s death had come at a time when the boy was\nwild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood\nwith him in his room and strove to close their ears against the\nshrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up\nWillett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the\nmessage that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward\nson.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad\nagain sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken\nthe news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his\nmeditations."Few of the rich people\'s children know their parents.I\nwas brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put\nmy arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her\narms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always\nso far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to\nme, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was\nrunning wild.And then--then--"\n\n"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That\'s\nin our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and\nwe are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I\'m like a little baby," he said sadly."I\'m just\nbeginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I\'ve ever\nknown.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so\nnear of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you\nso often that Jesus said?\'Of mine own self I can do nothing.\'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the\nChrist-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked\nthrough me.""You\'re going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her\nhand to his lips."You won\'t cast me adrift yet, will you, little\nsister?"Why, you\'re still mine, you\nknow!I haven\'t given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let\'s\ntalk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you\nare going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven\'t written a word for\nit now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless\nhulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is \'_as unto Him_.\'I would have done the same for\nanybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the\nhuman need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human\nchannel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own\ninterests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human\nneeds?Didn\'t Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and\nthe suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or\nworldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don\'t seem to\nunderstand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will\ndo.""I--I guess I know only the world\'s idea of love.""And that is love\'s counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,\nsex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work\nagain.You\'re going to write, write, write!My, but the world is\nhungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a\nsign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to\nyou comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is\nyour mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite\nand omnipresent.We\nnever fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find\nthat we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,\nand God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that\nplane of thought where you don\'t really care for what the world has to\noffer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not\nafraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,\nthat the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in\nmanifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it\nconstantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to\nlive.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause\nof everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter\nyour mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which\nit rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false\nthought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with\nhuman realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,\nand has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show\nit things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the\nhorrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of\nthe divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books\nof the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is\nit true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,\nthe carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its\nawful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,\nlike a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their\nunreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"\n\n"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human\nmind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that\'s\nall.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a\ngreat treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of\nrevenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a\nstimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth\nto bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real\nlife and good--"\n\n"Such things don\'t happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it\nwill make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of\nsolid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then\nwill find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human\nunrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of\nculture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,\n"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the\npracticability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about\nhim."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very\nradically from other people\'s, but he did not hide them for fear of\ngiving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about\nthemselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a\nfoundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the\nRabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before\nthe mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people\nwhat they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a\nking--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from\ncoming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are\nnot one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and\nmuck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,\nhaven\'t they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put\nforth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic\nin sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.\'To find fault,\' said\nDemosthenes, \'is easy, and in every man\'s power; but to point out the\nproper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.\'The remedy which I\npoint out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that\nmankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a\nsuccess, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced\ntruth without fear--because he made his business the service of\nhumanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human\npreferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of\neternity.""You\'re _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why\ndoes the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not\nwant to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully\nquotidian thought."You didn\'t let me finish," he said."I was going\nto say that I\'m afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I\nshall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don\'t use that word \'afraid.\'how the human mind clings to\neverything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or\nspoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel\nor work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to\ncrystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human\nthought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I\'m hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,\n"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not\nwhere, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human\nmind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield\na tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly\nknowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when\nthe man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful\ndanger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love\nthat lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell\nyou the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love\nworks through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book\nmay reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it\nwill tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close\ntogether that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the\nserious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to\nbe associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,\nbadly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has\nbeen cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost\nwithout limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has\nbeen obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as\nsecurity for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must\nbe allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time\nas all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply\ncut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien\'s lawyer called on\nher to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured\nan injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be\nunraveled."Ames is out to do up\nthe Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to\nutterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we\'ll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward\nMiss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen\'s\nsake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am\ntrying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it\'s like a\nred rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell\nmy oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all\nnow, including Madam Beaubien."There\'s another anomaly: while Ames is trying to\nruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,\nElizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this\nmeeting, for I\'m getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous\nlanguage to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the\nwoman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely\nartificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And\nstill Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form\nher big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can\'t we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the\ncotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he\npromptly closed down his Avon mills.Then\nhe resumed, but on half time.I presume\nhe will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This\nway: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand\nhands out in the cold.Meantime, he\'ll influence every other spinner\nin the country to do likewise.Now, can\nCongress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will\ngrease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may\nbe sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at\nonce.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and\nthen--"\n\n"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang\naround the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those\nold sap-heads.What information she won\'t succeed in worming out of\nthem isn\'t in \'em, that\'s all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information\nfor a personal attack upon Ames, she\'d leave us.""There\'s no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I\'ll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don\'t think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not\nuse the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but\nsomething, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always\ncomes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody\ndown there who needs help, even the President himself, she\'ll throw\nthe Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney\'s case."No, that\'s true, Ned, for while we preach she\'s off somewhere\npracticing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates\nthem.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she\nhas given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous\ngatherings at Madam Beaubien\'s spoken truth or nonsense?If you\nbelieve our report, then accept and apply it.Now who\'s to go to Avon\nwith Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there\ndiscovered he was Ames\'s son, they\'d eat him alive!"Then, turning to his\ncompanions:\n\n"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He\'d like to report on his\nresearch work.No\ntelling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became\nsuddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the\nwindow."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His\nthought had been dwelling on that\'something not ourselves\' which he\nknew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10\n\n\n"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for\nus are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little\ngroup which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first\nhours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd\nleave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that\nmarvelous record of a whole nation\'s search for God, the Bible.As\nhave been men\'s changing concepts of that\'something not ourselves\nthat makes for righteousness,\' so have been individuals, tribes, and\nnations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in\nIsrael\'s thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people\nfor truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,\ntheir philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us\nthe Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,\nundecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to\napproach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even\nverbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record\nof Israel\'s changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of\nhuman caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus\nrevealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through\nall who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who\nsits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the\nChrist from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly\nstifled his emotion, and went on:\n\n"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called\nhuman mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the\nmind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning\nthat pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at\nlength, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its\nhuman man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional\nactivity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental\nconcepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as\nmaterial objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he\nshowed us how, little by little, that human mind\'s interpretations of\nthe infinite mind\'s true ideas became better, under the divine\ninfiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known\nto us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,\nand became conscious of that\'something not ourselves\' which makes\nfor right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and\nexternalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth\nin the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of\nour Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The\nprimitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth\nin legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites\nsought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a\ndesire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And\nthus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is\ntheir many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the\nmaterial.Their right-thinking\nbecame externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical\ncomfort.But the people\'s understanding was not sufficiently great to\nshield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always\nconstitute.The mist of\nmaterialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to\ndart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept\nof the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his\ntemples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to\nbehave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision\nfaded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes\nof the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long\ncenturies there developed that world wonder, a whole nation\'s united\nlonging for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their\nfallen fortunes.Though\ntheir concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would\ncome, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the\nheaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great\nlight.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the\nChrist-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it\ncame, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,\nand the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as\nrecorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic\nconception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten\nSon?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the\nChrist-principle, available to all mankind, was \'before Abraham.\'Had\na great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,\nif we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish\nnation \'demonstrated\' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and\nexpecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a\nperiod in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached\nits lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was\nbecome the world\'s harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his\nvulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison\nwith the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of\nit, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,\nbearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"\'Always our being is descending into us,\' said Emerson.But our true\nbeing can be none other than infinite mind\'s idea of itself.Our true\nindividuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was\nthat Israel\'s true being descended, filtering in through the thick\nmists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,\nfor it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their\ncarnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the\ngrace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that\nwould have enabled them to lay off the \'old man\' and his woes and\nafflictions, and put on the \'new man,\' divine mind\'s image.But the\ncarnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but\nmatter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his\nmessage by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation\nrent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have\nbeen cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,\nlike the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how\ntruth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human\nbeing.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that\ntruth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not\nconscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced\nby events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me\nunless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men\nonly after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions\nand aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the\nworld had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own\nexposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before\nthe human mind\'s absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real\nvalue, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our\nso-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind\nwas made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the\nChrist, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human\nmentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until\nat last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of\nsalvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man\nJesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It\nwas common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child\nby the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to\naccept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the\nlight of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination\nupon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must\nat once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the\nresurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called\nlaws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass\nby these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding\nmatter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject\nto the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that\n_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look\nwith more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to\nshed their fellows\' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are\ninterpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and\nits ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God\'s greatest\nidea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is\nGod\'s idea of us.The world calls it the\n\'soul,\' the \'divine essence,\' and the \'immortal spark.\'The Christ was\nthe real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the\nreal selfhood of each of us.It is not\nconceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was\nthis great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the \'unique\'\nSon of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it\nonly once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian\nera--something of tremendous significance.It was the\nbirth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the\nChrist-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,\nalone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned\nabout that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human\nchannel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us\nsee what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now\nknow they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel\'s idea\nof God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle\nappeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must\nadmit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we\nknow now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have\ndone were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through\nmen, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the\nknowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the\nworking of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was\nre-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring\nof the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine\'s time\ncaused the loss of the Church\'s power to do great works.We are\nforced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the\nChrist-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,\nElijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,\nand all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to\nmankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that\nprinciple as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation\nof God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was\nthe manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him\nthey were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many\nof his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have\nbeen voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he\ndemonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he\nexposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by\nhealing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It\nis true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the\ntheory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas\nwere real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was\nthe clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote\nCarmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with\nalmost unobscured fullness.God\'s existence had been discerned and\nHis goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but\nby no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those\nbefore him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that\nhuman consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who\nbelieved matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in\nour own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas\nintensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his\nwhole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained\nfor him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It\nwas his mission to show that the devil was \'a man-killer from the\nbeginning,\' because it is the supposition that there is power apart\nfrom God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is\nnothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by\novercoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that\nthought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of\nunderstanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole\npeople\'s search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,\nwherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the\npurpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of\ntruth which you will almost invariably find standing near the\nexposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of\nour era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of\nevil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let\'s get back to the question of the\nvirgin birth.""But let us first consider what\nhuman birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong\nquestion.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which \'I\' are you speaking, Ned?""The real\n\'I\' is God\'s image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,\nand never dies.And therefore it will\ncease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of\nnature, or even God\'s laws.Because\nGod is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human\nmind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both\nmale and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order\nto give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the\ndivine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of\nthe human mind are employed in the formation of another, their\noffspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,\nquite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who\'spake and it was\ndone,\' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real \'you,\' Ned,\nhas always existed as God\'s idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material \'you\' is put off.The\nmaterial \'you\' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was\nproduced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which\nthemselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of\nthe communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious\nbeginning."And so I\'m doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to\nextinction.Oh, it doubtless\nwill not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we\ncall death.It may linger until you have passed through many such\nexperiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it\nas soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of\ncountless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will\nappear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that\nthe human \'you\' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will\nendure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding\nthat mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,\nnor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know\nabout them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his\nletter to the Romans: \'They which are the children of the flesh, these\nare not the children of God.\'The birth of the children of the\nflesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus\nproduced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is\nnot founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,\nshowing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the\ngeneral assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it\nbased on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it\nlearns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon\nit attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear\nin the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;\nit grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very\nexistence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human\nthought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its\nbeliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its\nenvironment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which\nconstitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its\ndeath will be due to sin, to \'_hamartio_,\' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies\nnever knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of\nhuman, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: \'They that are after\nthe flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the\nspirit the things of the spirit.\'In other words, mankind are striving\nterribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly\nexistence.They are foredoomed to failure,\ndespite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: \'The\nspirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given\nme life.\'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the\ndrag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,\nthe\'man-killer.\'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination\nof the human mind\'s sense of limitation.It does not usher them into\nimmortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming\nplane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,\nunless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable\nthem to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time\nin trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain\nstrife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live\nand die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to\ndemonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn\'t we better begin that right\nhere and now?Wishing to die doesn\'t solve our problems.Suicide only\nmakes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death\nwhen we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death\nis but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual\ndeath--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,\nwhich is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their\nMasses, and--"\n\n"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and\nReverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to\ncover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible\nthat the man Jesus was \'born of a virgin\'?Quite so; but, more, _no\nman ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has\never begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had\nbeen born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have\ndeveloped such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three\nyears or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in\nsome way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been\nunderstandable at all to the human mind?He would have\nbeen wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If\nhe had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the\nmortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to\nhave so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light\nof the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the\nneed of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too\nhuman to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with\nwhich he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable\nto other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded\nmatter as unreal, as nothingness.And\nthey as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was\nsuch as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I\nsimply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness\nof God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all\nmaterial laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last\ndematerialized his material body.It\'s an astonishing thought--and\nyet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that\nreason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human\nrecords."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels\naccording to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical\nresearch during the past few years seems to have established the\nconclusion that Mark\'s Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to\nit there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in\nAramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that\nthe Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral\ntradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have\nthem.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin\nbirth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life\nof Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the\nvirgin birth.Mark\'s Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark\nhimself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the\nsecond century, spoke truly when he said: \'Mark having become (or\nhaving been) Peter\'s interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all\nthat Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which\nwas said or done by Christ.\'In other words, even as Renan admits,\nthe Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew\'s\nGospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of\nsayings.Mark\'s Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the\nCollection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the\nGospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the\nCollection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according\nto Matthew was compiled.Luke\'s Gospel was undoubtedly written by the\nphysician Luke, Paul\'s companion, and depended largely for its data\nupon Mark\'s Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say\nthat the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John\nof the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own\npresent great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material\nlaws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered\ncredible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it\nis quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the\nsubject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of\nthe disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these\ntouched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the\nvalidity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the\nfour Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of\nliterature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of\nthe immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of\nmatter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of\nJesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that\nhis birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human\nchannel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any\nconsequence.Jesus said that it\nexisted before Abraham."It has been said that the\nimmaculate conception was the result of Mary\'s realization that real\nman is the son of God.Certainly Jesus\ndid seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a\nwoman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her\nthat her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did\nacquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle\nwas brought into the world because of the world\'s tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the\nman Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox\ntheology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch\nis composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We\nhave no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,\nalthough parts of it may be based on data which either he originated\nor sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The\nbook of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two\npersons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon\nwas originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job\nillustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter\ninadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against\nconventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,\nfor we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the\nmost searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament\nbooks as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original\ndocuments, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by\nlater hands.I have already spoken of the first\nthree Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of\nthe third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple\nPeter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the\nbook of First John were written by one and the same author--but\nwhether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great\ndisciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems\nto be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in\nit, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been\nby another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is\nthe most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed\nit, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he\nwas no longer a Jew.For how could he have been\nother, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New\nTestament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,\nCorinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we\ncan add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,\nPhilemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy\nand Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the\nvarious Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has\nbeen said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and\nhere is the important fact for us--Paul\'s letters exhibit a\nmarvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the\ngrand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever\noccurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly\nspiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators\nseemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation\nof the Christ--ah!In the light of\nthis great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel\nnarratives loses significance.And how little there is in the\nGospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are\ncreed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,\ncompared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,\nthe Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the\'method and secret\' of the\nChrist.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have\nthought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the\nman Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and\nsurrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly\nthat the Christ will come when the \'old man\' is laid off.Not much\noccasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so\nclearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel\nis that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the\nsubject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the\nHebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a\nheaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your\nremarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written\nby Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul\'s\nwonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First\nCorinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have\nmentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail\nto grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;\nthe nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that\nopposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of\nright-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors\nthat assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a \'belief\nperiod,\' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable\nunderstanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have\nfallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant\ndamnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other\ntheological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all\ncan verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a\nsorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be\nafter the change called death only what they were before.It is like\nrecovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike\nmanifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,\nstill with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the\nbelief that the practical application of Jesus\' teachings must be\nrelegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply\nthe Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always\nweakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are\nbidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of\nthe world\'s philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have\nrested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is\nunreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one\nand only real fact of existence_!Then its\nopposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that\nthere is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes\nobjectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is\ncontained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the\nphilosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not\n\'good in the making.\'It is always error, the direct opposite of\ntruth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the\ngrave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: \'There seems\nto be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.\'Now\nfollow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous\nwith God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and\nfoul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus\' statement\nthat evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all\nmust and shall overcome.And the \'old man,\' with all his material\nconcepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus\nrevealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine\nMind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to\nthe acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire\nGospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during\nthose fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul\'s letters, which record his\nthought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the\ngenuineness of Paul\'s authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,\nthe Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the\nGospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in\nfifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into\nconsideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean\nFarrar says: \'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely\n_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?\'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known\nJesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane\nman.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been\naccepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known\nJesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the\nfirst century--the true events of Jesus\' life could hardly have given\nway to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the\nvarious Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of\nthe crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were\nwritten at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the\ndead raised by the practical application of Jesus\' teachings.Hence,\nmiracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly\nsufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New\nTestament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker\nis one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of\nmiracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have\nhealed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in\nopposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world\nsays the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his\nreporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not\nbreak a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony\nof the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as\nlaw.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,\nhe instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the\nbeliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and\nmakes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God\'s laws are\n_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it\nceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself\nsufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its\nfellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to\nperform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a\nsign of one\'s having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to\nenable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,\nwhich are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will\nperform miracles.These works\nwere the\'signs following,\' and attested their knowledge of the\nallness of God.Carmen--"\n\n"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God\ncould hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She\nproved God\'s law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent\nand omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to\ndo likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works\nwhich he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed\nReverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he\nwent on gently:\n\n"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have\nbeen so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves\ncondemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man\nis God\'s highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts\nof God\'s man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God\'s idea of\nHimself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its\ninterpretations.One of his grandest\ncharacteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the\nFather.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he\nbade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result\nthat he\'slept with his fathers.\'There is no more ironical statement\nin the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we\nhave no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the\nsick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to\nsubstitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer\nof affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed\nthe omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of\nGod as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note\nof contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who\nhears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is\n\'_that by which all is_.\'And in order to be such He must be, as the\nBible says, \'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.\'He must be\nimmovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true\nprayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to\nHim, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all\nour problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in\nproportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer\ndoes not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here\namong men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging\nthat He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests\nman\'s oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a\nknowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and\npowerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such\nprayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle\ngiven them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to\ndo it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia\nmedica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until\nthe splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to\nthe Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,\nnamely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly\ninstitution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth\ncentury Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a\nwhile Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which\nissued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon\npaganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the\nsick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,\nneither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or\nsave.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of\nhealing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back\nsteadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics\nconstitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat\nenthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"\nsaid Doctor Siler."I don\'t like to hear either my religion or my\nprofession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of\nthe entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present\nnecessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained\nfrom its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of\nwars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its\nassumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to\nthe world\'s expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with\nthe authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of\nenlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a\ncontinuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church\'s schools and\nhospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of\nChristianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance\nattests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country\nforced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his\nfist."The time has passed when a man can say, \'My church, be she\nright or wrong, but my church!\'and insist that it shall be forced\nupon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the\nmark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate\nheretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with\niniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to\nknow evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent\n_good_.Is it good to murder one\'s fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: \'If\nI regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.\'That is why\nthe Church\'s prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a\nfailing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all\nthat is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,\nthe Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has\nlittle of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material\nwealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the\nancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading\ntheir Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn\nto the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned\nto do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your\nfaith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken\nher place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing\nsoftly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little\ngroup became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird\nlament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to\nvoice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the\ngreat city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing\nsighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt\'s head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to\nspeak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept\nsoftly.The lines about Doctor Siler\'s mouth relaxed, and his lips\ntrembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite\'s hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We\nare more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in\nreality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his\ndeparture.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don\'t you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the\nChrist.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who\nhad remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the\nBeaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,\nif I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that\nthis might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:\n\n"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in\nAvon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon\nto-morrow?There was a look of fear in her\neyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11\n\n\nThe town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from\nwhich its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,\nsome enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few\nprimitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared\nabout the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered\nmarvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the\ncompany became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,\nto protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest\ncreditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the\ndefunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit\nof inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had\noccurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the\nlooms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the\nspinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They\nseemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They\nseemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of\nmaterialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He\nfamiliarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was\nalready well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the\nidle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was\ndoubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become\na corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the\ncentury just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment\nlooking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she\ncould see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store\nbuildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the\nenormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull\nroar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the\ntrack, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children\nwere picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a\nhand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an\'\nhim, we worked in de mills; but dere ain\'t no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain\'t nobody to home," he\nreplied."De ol\' man an\' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi\' me," spoke up the boy\'s companion, a bright-faced\nlittle urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then\nturned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,\ndown toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district\nwhere stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to\nhouse its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,\nhorrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,\nbroken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while\nhe trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor\nto his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow\nstaircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up\nfour of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a\nlong, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of\nher bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a\nMarcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul\nair and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed\nto hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her\narms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two\nlittle girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,\nranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen\'s guide abruptly,\npointing a dirty finger at her.The woman\'s face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue\nto the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his\nface, "she say she don\'t spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and\nextending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial\nto these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,\n"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove\nstood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,\nupon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained\nand grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few\nrickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were\nunadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster\nhad fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman\'s expression changed.A\nlight came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered\nhand.Then, sweeping\nthe girl\'s warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair\nfor Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman\'s voice again\nrose sharply."You are--what do\nyou say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go\naway laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy\nbaby from the woman\'s arms and sat down with it.For a moment she\npatted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the\nbewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down\non one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their\nsoiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as\nthey gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their\nmidst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to\ntalk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling\ndown into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can\'t take\nany of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello\'s boy last\nweek--but you can\'t have mine!"I don\'t want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the\nfrightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to\nhelp all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only\nhalf time, aren\'t they?But we,\nyou and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody\nhere, aren\'t we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman\'s\nfears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let\'s see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced\ninquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no\nlonger contain himself:\n\n"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes\nand set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at\nher children, and then about the miserable room in which they were\nhuddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then\nthese gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her\nmouth--\n\nBut before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an\narm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her\nand kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God\'s universal language is the language of love.All nations, all\ntribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,\nand the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could\nnot comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her\ndreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to\ntreat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle\nagainst misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their\narms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused\nher, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she\nlived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman\'s\nhead upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her\nface."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from\nheaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a\nfew directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the\nbleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of\nawe:\n\n"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees\nand cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nUpward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that\nrise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the\nceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,\nhis heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this\nsoul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the\ncrashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself\nto low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from\nthe muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into\ndividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;\nup from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes\nlie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary\ntextile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,\nthe hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes\npossible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus\nwhose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this\ngirl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group\nof children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that\nthey could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,\nstraining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a\nhuman being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,\nwho lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death\nin one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a\nhundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She\nherself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,\nbecause the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with\nsafety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of\nlife suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and\nwent for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to\nCarmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail\nunwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a\nweaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns\nabout eight dollars a week now."But you can\'t live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could\nlive.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I\nhave several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with\nItalian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to\ntime.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the\nman to whom she had yielded her husband\'s life and her own."A man\'s no good in the mills after he\'s fifty," she said."You see,\nMiss, it\'s all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and\nactive.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and\nbad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours\nat a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where\nhe can\'t make so much.And when he\'s about fifty he\'s no good for the\nmills any more.""Well, if he hasn\'t any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if\nhe has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they\'ve got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,\ntoo.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even\nyounger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It\'s against the\nlaw; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I\nhaven\'t spent all of it yet.I\'m pretty\nspry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your\nhusband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one\nlittle room?"Why, his company gave me almost a\nhundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel\'s man\nlost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and\nthree years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to\npay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars\na week."A little hand stole up along Carmen\'s arm.She looked down into the\nwondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if\nyou were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her\nthought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to\ndrop in and look after Katie Hoolan\'s children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back\nhere," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,\nthen soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway\nwhich led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a\ndozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in\nparticular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad\nreputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so\nthe widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken\nstove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them\nwas molding and rotting off."It won\'t stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking\nat it.The\ncreek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the\n\'death-room.\'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human\nhabitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is\nunconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less\ntruly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of\nthe means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ\nwhen it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames\'s\nmethods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy\noffspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to\nblame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he\nbuys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the\nprey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,\ngold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation\'s greed!"Nay, more, he\nis the externalization of a people\'s ignorance of God.Carmen\'s throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the\nwretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,\n"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn\'t\nmake it look much better if I tried.We have\nto get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped\nthere from the creek, and it\'s a long climb up these stairs when\nyou\'ve got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my\ncoal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so\nfar."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman\'s lot\nseemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there\nburned within her soul a something that the oppression of human\navarice could not extinguish."It\'s the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It\'s\nnot so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in\nEngland.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked\nfrom seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so\nbad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the\nboss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents\ndied when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and\ndied of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that\nwork.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her\nvoice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan\nbabes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the\nhideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long\nbreath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as\nwith leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel\nhung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the\ndirection.These tenements don\'t have\nfire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an\nhour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal\nmind\'s chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of\nAvon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too\nimbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and\ndestroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There\nwas no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and\nmenacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,\nPole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to\nthe angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her\nsimple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the\nlove that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart\nthat lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered\nhearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their\nlanguages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and\nthat knowledge fell like the sun\'s bright rays upon them.She knew\nGod, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,\ngray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which\nenslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric\nlamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering\neyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness\nof God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the\nReverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not\nalive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the\nreligiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had\nbreathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers\nand mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,\ndespite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These\nwere the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed\ngross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent\n_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be\nreally known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous\nthings of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend\nDarius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a\nyear in his rich New York church."It\'s quite a sight, ain\'t it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,\nyoung, and of Irish descent."It\'s a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his\ntones.he cried, catching a passing workman\'s arm."He ain\'t worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and\ntouching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the\nworkman started away:\n\n"You\'ll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on\ninto the darkness."It\'s trying to reach a few of \'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man\'s stomach\'s empty he hasn\'t much respect\nfor morality.And I can\'t feed the lot of \'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I\'ve some rooms, some on Main street,\nwhich I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,\nwhich I call the Mission.They\'re reading rooms, places for men to meet,\nand get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall\'s for the fellows\nwho work, like this Fagin.The Mission\'s for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or\nreligion don\'t figure.It\'s to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly\ndemanded.He looked down at little Tony,\nand then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to\nyour Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I\'ve been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from\nhis surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I\'d had some\nexperience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the\nconclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn\'t be\nset upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently\ninterested.You see, Miss, I believe in my\nfellow-men.Oh, it\'s only\ntemporary, I know.It ain\'t going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there\'s going to be trouble here.And it\'s going to be a bad one."I\'ve written him several times of late.But it\'s not\nmuch I see he\'s doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these\npoor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the\npriest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn\'t like priests.And my labors\ndon\'t reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away\nfrom the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into\nTony\'s hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and\nopened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus\'s room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened\nout."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street\nbelow, "it ain\'t right to take you to the Mission--"\n\n"We\'ll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there\'s a telephone in your place?I want to call up\nthe health officer.I want to report the condition of these\ntenements.""It won\'t do any good, Miss.I\'ve camped on his\nheels for months.If he\ngets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn\'t here to report on conditions, but to\noverlook \'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful\nbuildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It\'s criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was\nstudying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length\nhe inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven\'t seen Pillette\'s house then?He\'s resident manager of the Ames\nmills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager\'s\nresidence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees\nin an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements\ndown there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible\nhot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the\nbabies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with\nperspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And\nwhen they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He\nknows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their\nsenses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and\nfall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn\'t put safety devices\nover his machines, because he doesn\'t care.I\'ve written to him a\ndozen times about it.But--\n\n"And then Pillette," he continued; "I\'ve asked him to furnish his\nhands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in\nthat inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a\nbarrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed\naside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don\'t even give \'em\nchange rooms!He won\'t give \'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send\nout invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a\nthought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to\nenable him to give such a ball, don\'t you?"The memory came back now\nin hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches \'em coming and going!""You see,\nhe manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,\nprotecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his\noutput.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher\nprices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn\'t result in increased\nwages to them.He is\nthe only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared\nbefore Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then\ndemanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the\ngreat man\'s hand, and speciously represented to his dignified\ncolleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the\npeople" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to\nevade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and\nbought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that\nhis owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his\nface turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped\nagainst the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how\nneedless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be\nto remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a\nmodicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she\ncould not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills\nof more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less\nstupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent\nprofit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,\ndespairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to\ncome from a long distance.They were in front of an old,\ntwo-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While\nshe gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a\nstock of old clothes I keep on hand for \'em when I send \'em out to\nlook for work.I\'ve clothed an average of four men a day during the\npast year, and sent \'em out to look for jobs.I board \'em, and keep\n\'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend \'em\nmoney.No, I never bother about a\nman\'s religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the\nsmall but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep\ntab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to\nhunt work, I give \'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get\nfunds I\'m going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little\nchapel, so\'s the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of \'em don\'t have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven\'t either of us asked the other\'s name," she said."I\'ve been dying to know yours," he\nreplied."I\'m Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn\'t matter,\njust so\'s I\'ll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl\nsimply.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and\nvisit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty\nback to the city.But--"\n\n"I\'ll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two\nof Father Magee\'s assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring\nfor the few applicants below."You\'re right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the\ntrain.It eats my heart out to\nsee the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o\'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city\neditor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I\'ve been with Dante--no,\nDanny--in Inferno.I want expense\nmoney--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd\'s eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I\'ll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I\'m going home\nnow," she replied.CHAPTER 12\n\n\nIt is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this\ngreat commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is\nsomething more significant to him than what is embraced in the\ndefinition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the\ngenus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such\nfrail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of\nwhat goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those\ndoors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to\nthe law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched\nthose legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the\ninterpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their\nframing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and\nespecially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and\ninstructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding\nhis legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of\nthis fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If\nthe people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked\nas carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their\npresent wrongs continue long to endure?And after she\nhad spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a\nMr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,\nshe knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its\nbaneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed\nprecincts of a nation\'s legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench\nin the shadow of the Capitol\'s great dome and asked herself the\nquestions: "What am I here for, anyway?And\ninstinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon\nher own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after\nshe had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,\nincluding self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the\ncity, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials\nwas her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,\npublished without her signature.Following it was the editor\'s\ncomment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its\nexposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry\nin that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he\nwould be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though\nquite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were\nnothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And\nshe had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising\nall she had learned from Mr.She\nmust get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph\noffice, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly\nhurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her\nthought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious\nmorning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered\naimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the\nCapitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at\nthe gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a\nsingle flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,\na kind that she had never seen before."We call it the \'President\' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response\nto her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom\nlike living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her\npay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a\nfew moments later.The mighty\nsentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the\nConstitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal\nstone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism\ninto mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,\nthe people of your great State are represented in the national Senate\nby--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in\nthe corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his\nineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators\nrepresents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as \'the people\'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the\nbrilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a\ndisease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation\nfrom good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the\nbelief that upon men\'s own human efforts depend all the happiness and\nsatisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but\nhappiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort\nto acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her\nlife except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses\' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold\nherself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and\nassisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to\nyou, but you didn\'t seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to\nbrush the dust from her dress."Well, I\'m glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with\nus."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man\'s anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and\nthen of something quite different.The girl\'s long, thick hair had\nbeen loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed\nin the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked\nupon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You\'ll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said\nfirmly."And I\'ll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly\nwith her hair."Oh, I\'m not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I\'ll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had\nbeen riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and\nlooked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the\ndistant house."And you are--"\n\n"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly\nenjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly\nunpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,\nwasn\'t I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple\ngirl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the\nglorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of\na great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and\nmotioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you\nhappened--"\n\n"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn\'t\nhappen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and\neffect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing\nyou.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,\nevil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:\n\n"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you\ncome to see me about that?I can do nothing--"\n\nThe girl shook her head."No," she said, "it\'s to prevent a revolution\nhere in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,\nthe President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to\nher."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the\nPresident of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you\nto tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking\napprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know\nnothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from\nthat topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and\ncarried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and\nstared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points\nwhich impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to\nher past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been\nimprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,\nRosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have\nreceived."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep\nin the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the\nPresident seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if\nto end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of\nhelplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can\nyou not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,\ndoubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very\ntrying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It\'s like getting at the essence of Christianity,"\nshe said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do\nthat, but it hasn\'t made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the\npeople who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among\nthem.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the\nballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their\npublic officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant\nof the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by\nsome strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters\nthe door of office.And then\nthey, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people\nrise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It\'s really\nchildishly ridiculous, isn\'t it?when you stop to consider it\nseriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,\nlooking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"\nshe slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at\nit, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after\nsome reflection:\n\n"The people will always--"\n\nThe door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown\nopen, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the\nungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o\'clock, and I am here\nto keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the\nyoung girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her\nface close to that of the President.His\nattention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the\nsinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the\nperson upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile\nilluming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before\nher."We meet pretty often, don\'t\nwe?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the\nPresident, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White\nHouse, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It\nseeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant\nsarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would\nlike to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your\nbusiness," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,\nMiss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames\'s features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with\nmeaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press\nwith us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton\nschedule."His\nindignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in\nregard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the\nassumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the\nSpinners\' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of\nthat Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite\nlimited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that\nbody, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will\nemploy that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:\n\n"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"\nglancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He\npaused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the\nPresident.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:\n\n"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly\ninfluenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we\nare saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must\nrealize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in\nwhich your election was--"\n\n"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the\nCatholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very\ngenerous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for\nwithholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion\ntoward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn\'t look well on the\nfront pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young\nfriend here isn\'t going to mention them to her superiors; but,\nnevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon\nyour second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a\nposition to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have\nalready once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to\njoin with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass\nthe present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"\n\n"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with\n_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"\n\n"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,\neh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous\nsneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my\ntenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down\nthere, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your\nperception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their\nhot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead\ntheir cause with you."But you first come here to--"\n\n"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet\nrevealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if\nnot too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous\ndrunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease\nof the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he\nhad, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that\nfascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which\nhe could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how\neasily he could crush her!"But you couldn\'t, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her\nhead.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had\nread his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before\ntruth.It makes a coward of you, doesn\'t it?Your boasted power is\nonly a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our\ninterview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who\nis slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism\nof wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar\'s.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on\nunhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,\nour public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can\'t see how you, the\nhead of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the\nPresident\'s face.Then he\nturned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don\'t know what quarrel\nthere is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss\nCarmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have\nbeen voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us\nsee if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your\nnewspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of\nthe human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We\noppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the\nmadness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes\nour hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the\nimmigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by\nthe horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes\nand makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons\nincrease in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their\nwealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation\'s\nconscience."They do not all--"\n\n"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in\ntime become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men\nobey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and\ncharacter of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which\nthey blindly worship.They grow\nmetallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins\nthey heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought\nstamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:\n\n"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of\nwhich their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison\nthe very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,\n"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul\nfor great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss\nCarmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished\nexcoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly\nstate by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn\'t we better sing a hymn\nnow?You\'ll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own\nmines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she\ncontinued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own\nor control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don\'t you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion\nlabored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine\nright," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by\nour man-made social system!\'The heavens are thine, the earth also is\nthine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded\nthem.\'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a\nGod who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege\nand divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low\norder of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the\nsentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent\nquite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude\non the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the\nPresident\'s."I admire the man," she said,\n"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in\npermitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you\nalone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven\'t I?"But first--"\n\nShe went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might\nawaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so\ndesperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than\nmore liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you\nare hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the\nwringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities\nof your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on\nher face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and\nthem that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for\ngreater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this\nworld.Don\'t you really want the little babies to have enough to eat\ndown there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in\nthe matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and\nsorrow at your mills?that one\'s greatest\nhappiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him\nfor a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as\nshe took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish\ndesire."I--I guess I\'m like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,\nyou\'ll wear my rose, won\'t you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for\nparty principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He\nis the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party\nprinciple."Under the spell of the girl\'s strange words every emotion fled from\nthe men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just\nthat about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:\n"You will find in yesterday\'s Express something about Avon.You will\nnot use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will\nyou?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great\napostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed\nagainst that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other\nsat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always\nleft him."She\'s the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an\nugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge\nfist down hard upon the desk.And, what\'s\nmore, she\'s head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that\'s neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to\nknow what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the\nPresident meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"\n\n"Damn the girl!""I\'ve got proofs that will ruin\nher, and you too--and, by God, I\'ll use \'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my\nfriend!"For a long time he sat\nstaring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,\n"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There\nisn\'t a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we\'ll talk this matter over\nsome other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the\nwinds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and\nplunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or\nnot?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"\nhe answered quietly.CHAPTER 13\n\n\n"It\'s corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had\nfinished reading Carmen\'s report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be\nto adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But\nshe\'s a wonder, Hitt!And she\'s booming the Express to the skies!That\'s why she is so--as the\nMexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but\nwith that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He\'s got a son down in\nCartagena somewhere, and he doesn\'t write to her either.She\'s told\nSid the whole story, and he\'s working it up into a book during his odd\nmoments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original\nchannel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she\ntried to head us off.As if she\nhadn\'t already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We\'ll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied\nHitt."I\'ll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully\nbelong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the\npublic!I see no reason for\nconcealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from\nItalian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports\ninto their own columns?"Did you wire her to see\nGossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I\'ve put dozens of senators\nand congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I\'ve prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the\ngirl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating\nvein, doesn\'t she?Meanwhile, she\'s circulating around down there and\nadvertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my\nfriend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly\ndown."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"\n\nHitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me\nthat beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles\nchemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent\nwater, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and\nabout two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of\nthe first grade there wouldn\'t have been even the two per cent of\nsolids.You know, I couldn\'t help thinking of what Carmen said about\nthe beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the\ndeleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is \'God\'s eldest daughter.\'Emerson\nsays it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul\nthat intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which\nis supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to\npurify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown\nbottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer\nsimply can\'t stand the light.It\'s astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will\ntake their advertising stuff.It\'s just as bad as patent medicine\nads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual\nhundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is\nspent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I\nlearned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely\nadvertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was\nsomewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an\nounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per\ncent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on\nsociety, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because\nwe won\'t advertise their lies and delusions.It\'s as bad as\necclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and\nwent directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a\nstudy of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them\nin the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to\nWashington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her\nindustry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In\nWashington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed\nessential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do\nthis and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in\ngreat part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of\nmanner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a\nmentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned\nover her expenses, but promptly met them."She\'s worth it," growled the latter one day."She\'s had four\ndifferent talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she\ndoes it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and\nto the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that\ndoddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that\nAmes was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth\nand nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you\nknow what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and\nchild of us!Have\nwe come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,\nDoctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames\ndid it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,\nand one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when\na roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our\nstreets."I\'ve centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can\'t stop him, then God himself can\'t!"A few moments later he came out\nagain and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she\'s sent\nfrom Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It\nhasn\'t escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up\nher information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the\nletter."\'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the\n  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a\n  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other\n  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending\n  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on\nhis desk."This\ncountry\'s going stark, staring mad!We\'re crazy, every mother\'s son of\nus!""It\'s the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without\nany basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from\nthe gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been\nknocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the\ncorner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into\nhim."Oh, I\'m so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian\nInstitution, and I guess--"\n\n"Don\'t mention it, Miss Carmen.It\'s a privilege to have my hat\nknocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer\nmy--"\n\n"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,\nwill you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in\nyour debt.""I was on my way to a\nrestaurant."I\'ve got a little place around the corner here\nthat would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few\nminutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner\nof the doctor\'s favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the\ndoctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the\nWhite House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That\'s twice to-day I\'ve been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily\nover his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both\nmental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting\nvolubly."Ames and the President don\'t seem to be pulling together\nas well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him\nnow in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the\nresult will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close\nto administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data\nregarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"\n\n"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors\nare striving for, anyway.Are your activities\nall quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are\nafter?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one\'s attitude\ntoward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are\nonly honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make\nmoney--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving\ndefeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen\nscrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let\'s see.If you doctors\nhave made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal\ndisease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is\nnothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I\nknow that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a\nbungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of\nmedicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and\nbitter experience, isn\'t it?And its cost in human lives is simply\nincalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as\nthe so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and\npreaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting\nupon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat\ncoming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest\ncuriosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him\ntalk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young\nmen, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of\ndollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in\nthe choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune\nin the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the\ncredulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,\nwith smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing\nof a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes\ninnocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave\nmankind subject to the rest.Do\nyou expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes\nharmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,\neradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease\nto die?All the time you are working only in matter and through\nmaterial modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of\nlife immortal?Your patients\nget well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as\ninevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on\nmaking them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do\nbetter.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;\nand human beings will be no more.Why don\'t you realize this, you\ndoctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the\n_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"\n\n"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is\nreliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is\ndependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of\nthe _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental\nsuggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine\ntruth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in\nmatter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the\nhuman mind.The origin of healing is\nshrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has\nbeen marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first\ndoctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose\nremedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration\nin the brew concocted by Macbeth\'s witches.And think you he has\ndisappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago\nthat a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly\nkilled black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had\nrefused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago\nsome one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a\nsick child\'s head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there\nexhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are\nresident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to\nmaterial sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own\nauto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for\ndisease, and his exclamation of gratitude: \'How great is the mercy of\nGod who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!\'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not\ntheorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to\nbe.""You handle conditions as the\nhuman, mortal mind believes them to be, that\'s all.You accept its\nugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through\nlegislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent\nit if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon\nyou."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,\nas Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your\nhigher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the\nspiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is\nmore matter.Why, ignorance and\nsuperstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies\nin use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine\nand place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the\nonly curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who\nswallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss\nCarmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she\nreplied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and\npatients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the\ndrugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most\nprominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the\nuse of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get\nwell of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for\nthem.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor\'s pen, in\nwhich he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume\nin order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he\nstates that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his\nhands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the\nconfidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two\ndrastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes\nof the chronic drug taker.These are, first, \'Take away opium and\nalcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be\nbroken inside of forty-eight hours,\' and, second, \'No drug, save\nquinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.\'In words\nwhich he quotes from another prominent physician, \'He is the best\ndoctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.\'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are\ngradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and\none doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to\nthe\'six or seven real drugs.\'Still further light has been thrown\nupon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the\nPhiladelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House\nCommittee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying\nthat it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent\nmedicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the\nfaith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for\nrelief becomes the victim of \'bottled faith.\'If his faith is\nsufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been\n_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the\npatent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if\nthe sick man\'s faith has been aroused to the point of producing a\ncure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,\ntherefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds\ncan stimulate the sufferer\'s faith to the point of meeting his need,\nthe business is quite legitimate.\'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,\'\nadds this member of the Drug Exchange, \'are the real essentials for\nworking healing miracles.\'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with\namazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to\nhelp them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I\nknow how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every\nvagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren\'t\nyou?""You haven\'t really seriously thought out your\nway, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a\nblanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect\nseriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little\nof the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our\npresent medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of\nmedicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the\nother of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and\nreprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can\nshow the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been\nascertained.A recent writer says: \'As important as we all realize\nhealth to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but\nscientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on\nin the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.\'He\nfurther says that, \'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we\nmeet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment\nthat regular medical systems can not cure,\' and that many of these\nwould try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that\nis going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient\'s life and\npurse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can\nlight upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than\nis the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in\nthe present stage of the world\'s thought; but it is likewise admitted\nto be \'the very uncertain art of performing operations,\' at least\nninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the\nsick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon\nthe choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out\ndemons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is\nthe ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and\nplants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude\nand inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may\nbe very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the\nchoice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the\npractice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and\nharmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of\nmaterial accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And\nwe have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of\nthe babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of\nfear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger\nblood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of\nthis will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting\nsickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the\nsame class as the white of an egg.It is the\nresult of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered\nfrom diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that\ndisease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human\nmentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,\nand of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to\nthe human mind\'s changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they\nreally are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying\nabout a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly\nunable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is\na lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is\nnever distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,\nbut always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not\nhold a single thought without that thought tending to become\nexternalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization\ngenerally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center\nall its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its\nsense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of\nfalse thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle\nupon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes\naway with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of\ndisease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are\nmental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that\ndisease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,\nor to discipline and train them for paradise.Think\nof regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don\'t wonder\npeople die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: \'The time will come\nwhen it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the\nworld will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some\nvicious thinking.\'Many people seem to think that thought affects\nonly the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here\'s a question I intended to\nask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not\ntestify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to\ndisease, then they can\'t testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back\nwith an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to\nbelief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the\ncase of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of\nrecovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,\nyou see."But--nerves feel--"\n\n"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human\nthought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to\nattract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and\ncaught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man\nbowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the\ngirl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for\nhis Church?He--well, it is his business to see\nthat members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn\'t it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return\nfor offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial\nschools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The\nExpress--"\n\n"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so\nwe heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of\nHealth bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"\n\n"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in\nWashington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular\ngovernment as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our\nconstitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and\nby the Government\'s constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,\ncan it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of\npracticing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,\nor\'regular\' school?The American Medical Association, with its\nreactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous\nendeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would\nresult in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of\nwhich would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a\n\'healing trust.\'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the\nAmerican people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and\nsuperstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning\nSun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the\nMiddle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance\nand tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock\nin the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a\nprogressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly\nunscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly\nknown to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold\nsuffering and misery, and then to say, \'_Thou shalt be cured thereby,\nor not be cured at all_,\' is an insult to the intelligence of the\nFathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the\nlight.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you\nshall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the\nthought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and\nexperimentation along the materialistic lines of the\'regular\' school,\nof curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke\nof medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a\nclarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil\nwhich lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged\nout into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and\ngreed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses\nitself in the demand, \'Who shall be greatest?\'to dictate the course\nof conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to\nadmit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of\nmind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought\nliberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,\n_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have\nthe effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a\nveil.That--"\n\n"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind\nmany of them.Mankind just grope\nabout all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is\nright before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else\nHe will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God \'who healeth all\nthy diseases.\'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely\nignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a\ndreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be\novercome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them\nare not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to\nmake money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the\nphysician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of\npublic health--especially those doctors who say: \'If you won\'t take\nour medicines we\'ll get a law passed that will make you take them.\'To\nplace the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible\nmistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based\nupon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people\ngenerally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what\nlaws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly\noccupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not\nattempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this\nagitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,\nfor a change, teach Christianity?But even\nthe Bible has been put out of the schools.By your\nChurch, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by\nthose utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl\ntook up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out\nfrom among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even\nthough incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who\nstands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the\nwhole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in\nhis colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has\nintimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next\nyear."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent\nevil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too\ndark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThree weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence\nof the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master\nmanipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a\ndangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he\nknown that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen\nback to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,\nthat both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the\ngreat externalization of the human mind\'s "claim" of business sulked\nalone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after\nrighteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding\ntired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away\nthe long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier\'s car drew into the station his valets breathed\ngreat sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the\nperspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans\nof gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car\nsteps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his\nmaster\'s black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his\nchauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in\nthe direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors\nof his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and\ngenerally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with\nanger: "Have you read the last week\'s issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the\nreports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a\ncase from them--"\n\n"What?If you and he can\'t make out a case\nagainst them, then I\'ll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that\nbill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the\ncalling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I\'ve got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag\nher through the gutters!So, she\'s still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we\'ll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett\nheard from Wenceslas?""I\'ll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he\ntries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain\nrecently."he exclaimed in a voice that began\nhigh and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts\nseemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out\nof his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided\nit would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily\narticles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever\nmade by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole\nmiserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or\nrumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them\nliterally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked\npriest!That girl--that girl is\na--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light\ndistrict?Great record the publishers of the Express\nhave, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit\nunder a mountain of mud!I\'m ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I\'m out to get the President\'s\nscalp!Begin with those New York papers which we\ncan influence.I\'ll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we\'d better say to them.Our attacks upon\nthe President must begin at once!I\'ve already bought up a Washington\ndaily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit\nhis administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as\nsoon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems\nthat the reports which that girl has made have been translated into\nseveral languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to\nstir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood\nwhat your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite\nignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now\nthey think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the\ntariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely\nbitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of\ntalking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast\nbecoming acute.The mill hands don\'t believe now that you were ever\njustified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether\nyou reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands\nupon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands\ninclude better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,\nand very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor\nlaw, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would\nstrengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at\nAvon."I am\ndistinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>\nwench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and\nMall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"\n\n"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the\nExpress upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either\nin the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show\nof bettering things at Avon, we\'ll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his\nmaster.Was it possible that Ames--\n\n"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say\nhe has quite conquered his--his--"\n\n"You mean, he\'s no longer a sot?"Don\'t sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and\nthat the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames\'s mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His\nhead slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus\nenwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone\nwith his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his\nmad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of\nabsolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the\nrealm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose\nideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of\ncountless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he\nhad made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the\nbitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross\nhewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in\ntheir piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer\nof the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission\nfor the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a\ngreat favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in\nsecuring stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is\nwith myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to\nhire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how\nthese girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they\nare now, they can not live on that!Say,\nten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did\nspeak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the\nman\'s life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire\nstenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon\nitself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since\nshadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young\ngirl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her\npath crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her\nreflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,\nexposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before\nher advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien\'s\ntable and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she\ncame that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets\nto draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the\nworst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they\nplanned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a\ntime when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it\nthrough.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and\ntransformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United\nStates would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in\nessence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this\ngreat country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as\nbut a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,\nwhen that war should end, would control navigation on the great\nMagdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the\nemerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless\nbroken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that\na thought.His trip to Washington had been\nexhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,\nand there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His\nphysician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be\ncareful--\n\nBut why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,\nin all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,\nher portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there\nfacing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor\ntrace of hate.No; but always she\nsmiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to\nsay, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his\nmethods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,\nwould have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he\nadmired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her\nloyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,\nthat thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not\nreal!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that\nwoestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward\nhim--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive\nagain!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It\nwas unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that\nhe was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what\na blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other\nghastly sights!He would speak to her--\n\nBut--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair\nand--\n\nHer white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right\nthrough them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when\nher accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand\nupon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to\nrise--to break away--\n\nAnd then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he\nawoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master\'s white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that\'s\nall, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There\'s a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he\nseemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face\ndrew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without\nexamining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the\npieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at\nonce to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the\nagitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they\'ll find me\nready!"CHAPTER 14\n\n\nThe immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs\nmight have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private\nelevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands\' demands,\nand turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his\noffice above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his\nluxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen\nhim sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep\nthought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate\ngave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and\nbent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now\ndimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,\nsubtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of\nemotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were\nbut just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic\nsoul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself\nweak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among\nthe strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could\nnot define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that\ndull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout\nhis mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged\nthings of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp\noutlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as\nhe sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the\ngirl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an\ninterrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a\nman--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had\ndone?To\nstand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew\nhis tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most\ndaring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn\'t it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical\nlittle smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit\ndown!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a\nmoment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close\nto him."You haven\'t the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she\nsaid sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected\npleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,\nwhile the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that\nI have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from\na different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,\neh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been\nshedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion\ndead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so\nlovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his\nhellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I\njust had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys\nto get here.Aren\'t you glad I didn\'t send in my card?For then you\nwould have refused to see me, wouldn\'t you?""If I\nhad known you were out there," he said more gently, "I\'d have sent out\nand had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and\nnow I am sure it was--"\n\n"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted\n_me_.You see, it\'s just absolutely impossible to\noppose anybody who loves you.You know, that\'s the very method Jesus\ngave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to\npieces, until we find that we haven\'t any enemies at all any more.Well, that\'s the way I\'ve been doing with\nyou--just loving you."The man\'s brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed\nin the face from which he could not take his eyes?And\nyet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,\nthere was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon\nhis."It\'s the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster\nis only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren\'t you?I\'ll help\nyou," she added brightly."You\'re going to put off the \'old man\'\ncompletely--and you\'re going to begin by opening yourself and letting\nin a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren\'t you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,\nMiss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don\'t understand, Mr.You\'ll be, oh, so surprised\nsome day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the\nway human thought operates!For you can\'t possibly do another person\nan injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right\naway--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some\nday, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a\nperson, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It\njust brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,\n"you\'ve just _got_ to love those people down there!You can\'t help it,\neven if you think you can, for hate is not real--it\'s an awful\ndelusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of\nthings true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses\nlaid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the\nChrist was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The\nrestriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the\nbenign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not\ndesire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped\nwithin his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon\nthe words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of\nthem.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference\nwhich you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do\nyou know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that\nanother\'s hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to\nmeet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing\nalkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole\nuniverse as love!"We argue from different\nstandpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded\nbusiness man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why\nbusiness is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,\nfear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you\nhaven\'t the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,\nMr.The business of\nattempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"\nshe gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from\nmeddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me\nalone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of\nthe Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,\neh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That\'s uncovering evil, so\'s\nit can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your\nbusiness, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the\nlight, so that it can be--"\n\n"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I\nown--"\n\n"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you\noppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national\nownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I\nsuppose?"All our\npresent troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come\nfrom a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding\nof what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are\nvery foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don\'t you think\nso?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people\ndown at Avon don\'t know any more about what is the real good than you\ndo.And that\'s why their thoughts and yours center upon the false\npleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of\nthe so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of\nvice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then\nyou turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the\nBible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I\'ll be--"\n\n"Oh, don\'t swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up\ninto his face."It\'s time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won\'t you\nbegin now--to-day?Haven\'t you yet learned that evil is the very\nstupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won\'t you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time\nto learn to really live?You\'ve got plenty of time, you know, for you\naren\'t obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her\nsoft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked\ninto his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,\ncame from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long\ndormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long\nentrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet\nlearned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his\never-open mentality.And to those\nwhich savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with\nhimself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most\ngloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before\nhim, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of\nOphir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don\'t you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer\nto her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile\nagain lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can\'t\nwe?"And hasn\'t the time come for us to work together,\ninstead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from\nWashington.I am--I--"\n\n"We need each other, don\'t we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she\nbeamed upon him."I can help\nyou--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I\'ve been sorry for you,\nlittle girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"\n\n"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the\npresent, you know."And I\nwant to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little\none.Madam Beaubien hasn\'t been treated right, either."We\'re going to\nforget that in the good we\'re going to do, aren\'t we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I\'ve got\na plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that\nbelongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is\nrightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all\nabout.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,\n"don\'t think about me!It\'s the people at Avon that I want to help.""We\'ll help them, you and I. We\'ll make things right all round.And\nMadam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"\n\nWith a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent\nsuccess of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms\nabout his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel\nthe quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his\ncheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift\nof the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval\nthe man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise\nwithin him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we\'ll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and\nstepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the\nmeaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her\nhand.Not now--no, you\nneedn\'t come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn\'t know until to-day what it was that was making\nme over!Don\'t--"\n\nCarmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment\nupon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn\'t know," she\nmurmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We\'ll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I\'ll do anything--anything\nin the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be\nmy little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood\nseemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our\nages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages\njust as far apart as ours.I\'ll make Madam Beaubien rich!I\'ll support the\nExpress, and make it what you want it to be!I\'ll do whatever you say\nfor the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon\nyou!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these\nthings--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a\nwhisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I\nrefuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within\nthe next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I\'ve put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then\nshe glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,\nbut with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_\nlove.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and\nbursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,\nunresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it\nall over.It was sudden, I admit; I\ntook you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the\naccomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and\nanother lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which\nhas changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again\nshe smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It\'s all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the\ntime--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice\nthat trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but\nnot because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated\nhim from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it\nfound his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day\nto--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,\na letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your\npriestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,\nthough her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a\nlittle newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound\nbook, he held it out to the girl."Here\'s a\nlittle piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your\nclerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I\'ll tell you," bending over\nclose to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered\na few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15\n\n\nIf additional proof of the awful cost of hating one\'s fellow-men were\nrequired, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter\nmust furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were\nrendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon\na shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken\nonly in hushed whispers when one\'s thought dwells for a moment upon\nthe madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The\nman-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void\nwhich separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class\ninsolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry\naimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper\nwith each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder\nthe conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping\nin a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked\nthe typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested\nopposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer\nand thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has\never been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human\nhatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,\nand called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever\nseen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of\nlove upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a\nnation\'s resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that\nthey, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common\nbirthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know\nthe meaning of love?Oh, not by the\nhypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to\ntheir Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to\norder the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor\nvictims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them\nthat evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of\nknowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the\nChrist-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its\nomnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the\nlove that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,\nbetter concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of\nthe walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the\narrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt\'s\noffice.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He\nhad never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the\nwords, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you\'re out riding with\nWillett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and\nstarted for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the\ndoor she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in\ntears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took\nthe girl\'s hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"\nhe said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she\nleaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken\nmother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does\nthe strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the\nMan of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that\ncruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the\nwickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far\nfrom him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his\nanxious face."It\'s all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that\nkilled him.And--"\n\n"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he\ntried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as\nyet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It\ndidn\'t happen--it wasn\'t real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I\nfell--to the floor--but I didn\'t lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark\nwith anger.Ames only as--as God\'s child," she\nmurmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn\'t happen.Now I want to\nwork--work as I never did before!_I must!_"\n\n"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a\ndeadly thrust had been made at the girl\'s life."It didn\'t happen," was her\nreply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt\'s mind, kindled by the girl\'s insistence\nupon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you\nthat--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no\none but us shall know!The man\'s eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to\nhim and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he\nsaid in a choking voice.This is another\nopportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done\nnow," he said."I wonder--"\n\nShe took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she\nbecame calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they\nhave gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will\nsay nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd\nmight come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and\nrequesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later\nthe little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and\nSidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of\nmorning, when as yet the symbol of God\'s omnipresence hung far below\nthe horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil\'s further\nclaims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were\nassembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God\nalone knows.At ten o\'clock to-night I received this message."He\nopened the paper which he held in his hand and read:\n\n  "\'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,\n  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses\n  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,\nlike the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,\nstarted from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with\ncanny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the\ndarkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the\nculmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my\noil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a\npaper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of\nevil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,\nbought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant\nbrushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,\nsenators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could\nyou know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,\nhas tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,\nand entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the\nlegalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation\'s\nmanhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has\nfought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted\nbrewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, \'Make the boys drink!\'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to\nthe world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his\nclique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of\nmartyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its\ngrowth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the\nrevenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam\nBeaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I\ndoubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn\'t it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the\nproviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will\nnote that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my\npolicies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with\nthe insurance companies, don\'t you think that they will be advised\nthat I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the\ninsurance?And I shall find myself with a big\nlawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames\'s\nwork, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing\nhis suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss\nWall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent\nlittle boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he\nreturned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have\nendured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he\nmurmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared\nwithout knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly\nthreatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out\ninto an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to\nadvance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the\nfoulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at\nher feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even\nthough knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of\nwar, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door\nof the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the\nknowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son\nin distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of\nthe little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered\nhis promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father\nand Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"\n\n"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going\nto do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the\ngirl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it\na Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire\nfourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last\ntwo verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don\'t\nwe?We are going right on, as\'seeing Him who is invisible\' to men\nlike Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any\ndepartment of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;\nand we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now\nwe are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there\nthat we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a\nvery different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the\nwilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we\nshall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that\nthere is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet\nit, for--though the world hasn\'t learned this yet--_it is the supply\nitself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is\nour Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of\nthe infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling\nto the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going\nto Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,\nwithout one word of complaint or reviling, the world\'s most poignant\nsorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I\nseemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again\nnow!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to\nCarmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,\nbeckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,\nand we must get to bed.I\'ve really had quite a strenuous day!"He\nturned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the\npiano."Don\'t," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a\nhard one for you, I know.And--"\n\n"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in\nthe whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of\ndefinite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless\ntrain of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of\nstarvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life\nis at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of\nthe first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following\nAmes\'s rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind\nthem and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a\ndollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of\nthe bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself\nproved the soundness of Ames\'s single reply to all further appeal:\n"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and\nred, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the\nbrothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems\ntwine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,\n"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes\nfallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the\ngardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these\nnoxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,\nhave waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he\ngained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The\nworld was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with\nthe whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball\nweighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,\nand with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions\nof his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of\ntheir honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each\nyear, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this\nas casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less\nthought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had\never really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings\nwere wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a\nbusiness man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than\nhuman flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain\'s comforting\nphilosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have\nbeen so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and\nhis life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these\nswarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,\nhe would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The\neight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the\nSupreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill\nhands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their\ncommon good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who\nshould be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered\nviolence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism\nwithin the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of\nthe whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got\nin touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal\nhenchman\'s warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which\nthe great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the\nofficers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were\nhard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in\nall his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights\nwere of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general\npolicy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners\' Association\nthroughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop\nwas instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his\ninfluence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest\nwas engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired\nthe man\'s removal.The widow Marcus likewise had\nbeen doing much talking.Ames\'s lawyer, Collins, had her haled into\ncourt and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be\nprecipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of\naltering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners\' Association,\nAmes ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon\ntenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the\nraise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter\'s day that the magnate chose for the enforcement\nof this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the\nnight, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a\nknife.It was Ames\'s desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and\nhe had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous\ntask.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among\nthese hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation\nhad gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to\nawaken a nation\'s conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the\ncolumns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting\nthe responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and\nto a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a\ncotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did\nhe omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of\nejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames\'s hirelings,\nwith loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the\nmiserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts\nthat nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than\none tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab\nafternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just\nabove the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the\nsnow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,\ntoil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his\ninsatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his\nthin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one\nfrenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine\nright of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only\nto be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of\ncrimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see\nPillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these\nwere that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves\nwould show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains\nfrom their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,\nfor it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires\nbuilt along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;\nand the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate\nshelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,\nand into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the\nblizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen\nlight, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,\ncircling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and\npower with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled\nout into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main\nthoroughfare.Their low\ncurses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of\npent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything\nto destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of\nmaddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to\nthe cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by\narmfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great\nbarrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The\npolice gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before\nthe human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,\nincoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,\nthe carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,\nthe resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron\nfence, like hungry dock rats.On up the\nbroad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,\nand in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies\nover reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked\nroof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,\nprotestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his\nwife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who\nbear the world\'s burdens!It is you who create the rich man\'s wealth,\nand fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and\nSouth, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his\nmoney bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he\nturns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous\nprivilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great\nnation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up\nthe golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again\nenthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin\nand Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and\nbend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But\nthink you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a\nmillionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not\neffect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our\n"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to\natoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall\nwe know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and\nflowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and\nprescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled\nrestraint.Down into the creek\nbottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up\nthe far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the\ngreat mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their\nleaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the\nbuildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the\nravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with\ndesperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has\narrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last\nhours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all\nhuman philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart\nof hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of\nhuman exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls\nof the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in\nwithering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling\nloved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the\nsteel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great\nmetropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the\nquivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager\nmilitiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames\nmills were private property.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master\nsat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they\nstrained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm\nand determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at\nAlbany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He\nhad received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family\nwith a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression\nof black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the\nNew York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his\nproperty, and specified that the bullets used should be of the\n"dum-dum" variety.Such\nbullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was\ntrue.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had\npurchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the\nmilitia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And\nthen, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and\nCollins into the United States District Court and persuaded the\nsitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief\ncommittees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the\nindustrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung\nbefore his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had\nspurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that\nhad crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil\nwithin him.From the first she had\naroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never\nknown before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at\nthe opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless\neyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess\nthat fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his\ngrasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she\ntold him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had\nits price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin\nwith despair.And\nwith it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though\nwith foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden\nevery tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his\nthought forever more.And:\n\n              "----with hope, farewell fear,\n              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;\n              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept\nnot, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and\nplotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his\nworldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final\nruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not\nbecome his toy.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system\nupon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that\nsystem is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of\nthat poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up\nfrom the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles\nunslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they\ndragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a\nminute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill\ngroup, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch\nof the way.The air was thick with powder\nsmoke.The roar of battle was\ndeafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen\nstream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in\nthe work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make\nheadway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long\nbuilding.Then, the building\nsaved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task\nof arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The\ntown had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the\nmilitia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong\ncordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had\nhastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of\na detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional\nsurrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along\nthe dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the\nvictim who awaits the blow from the lion\'s paw in the arena.Weeping\nwives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the\nfrozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed\nmates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,\nhard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked\nout in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the\nslippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at\nthe side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these\nbewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own\nbreast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved\nmothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender\nwords of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they\nhad called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the\nAngel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among\nsuch miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying\nto lead them.The major\'s eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing\nout of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the\ngirl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away\nunder guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in\nhand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could\ncomprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the\ngirl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous\ninjuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous\nreturn fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine\nguns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen\'s guard halted.Then one of them\nfell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the\ngirl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a\nmoment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the\nparalyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping\nstrokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the\nlittle camp below.The tents\ncaught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men\ndropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed\nhither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the\nmerciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,\nand then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering\nbodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,\nAmes, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is\ndone among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between\nthem and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and\nstark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office\nof the Express.As she approached Hitt\'s door she heard him in earnest\nconversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express\nto-day, but I couldn\'t get much.And it\'s a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate\nthe policy of the paper.He\'s still\nfighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the\nKetchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt\nby Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that\nCarmen--"\n\n"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames\'s part to\nutterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her\nassociation with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of\nthe massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you\nthink?"Hitt\'s face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself\ncame through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of\ngladness to welcome her.The girl\'s eyes were wet, and her wonted\nsmile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is\nfor the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words\nstumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and\ntook her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"\n\n"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied\ngravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that\nmorning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank\nwhen I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won\'t less than\nthat amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,\nthen this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He\ntook out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to\nthe girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted\nhis protests over the size of the check, "something\'s killing that\ngirl!And it isn\'t only the trouble at Avon, either!"She\'s no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,\nand Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in\nprogress at Avon.A\nsocial and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to\nstarve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a\nhandful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest\ncentury as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice\nfor a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few\nmay be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of\nthe minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are\nsuffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves\nonly, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed\nthem to monopolize the country\'s resources.Future\ngenerations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse\nis there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be\njuggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to\nbe considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow \'corners\' on\nfoodstuffs, and permit \'wheat kings\' to amass millions by corralling\nthe supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the\npoor washerwoman starves?The\nexistence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof\npositive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our\nreligion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in\nasylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I\ncan not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the\nmental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are\nthe very worst offenders!"Doesn\'t the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day\'s work at\nAvon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility\nof a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of\nwhat is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize\nthat nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely\neven begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,\nanyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling\ninfluence in the shaping of mankind\'s moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal\nbusiness men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to\nemulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious\nmanhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he\nmade at Avon to-day!""The world\'s ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in\neverything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we\nhave been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can\'t take my thought from Avon--"\n\n"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are\nan offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with\nthe human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible\nthings within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands\ncrept past the guards and met in Father Danny\'s Mission, down in the\nsegregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go\nthrough the town to the Hall.He had\nslipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through\nthe day.She had gone first to the\nHall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little\ntown.And after she had deposited Hitt\'s check in the bank she had\nasked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more\nintelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the\nmoney.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to\napprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay\nover Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody\nwork of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and\nhad made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,\nheavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the\nprisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and\nplaced under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest\nthreatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly\ngreeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great\nrevolution we\'ve all known wasn\'t far off!I just _had_ to get back\nhere!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he\nsprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,\nmen, we\'ll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,\ndon\'t buy of the company stores!""We\'ll have to, Father," said one of them."But they\'ve never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they\'ve discounted that ten per cent each time.But\nif we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss\nCarmen, we\'ll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them\nout to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that\nat any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as\nyou, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own\nits mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it\'s but love that I\'m dealin\' out to \'em, God knows!And\nyet, it\'s they that are masters of the situation, only they don\'t know\nit!They\'ve no leaders, except such as waste their\nmoney and leave \'em in the ditch!The world\'s social schemes, Miss\nCarmen, don\'t reach such as these.And they\'ve got\nthe contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"\n\n"Don\'t hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn\'t give all our\nthought to the rich, eh?But still, it\'s wholly up to the people\nthemselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men\nas Ames won\'t know what\'s hit \'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of\nsoldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like\nstone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant\nhalted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl\nback and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands\nquickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they\nthrew themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers\nfought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the\nsoldiers.One of them seized Carmen and\nthrew her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been\nheard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,\nbeneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his\nposition, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to\nthe mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back\ndoor.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door\nand raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched\nforward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in\nquick succession.Then\nthey turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through\nthe door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched\naway with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16\n\n\nWith the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton\nAmes sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the\nstreets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And\noften and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out\nupon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste\nbasket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,\nred-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,\nthis man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his\nsight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a\nchill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he\npassed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in\nthe grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had\nbeen found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been\nripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down\nthere blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He\nreally had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose\nthe vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become\nanarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric\nwhich such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection\nafforded their sacred rights!And\nthe great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had\nthus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet\nhis carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly\ndifferent stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in\nCarmen\'s presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not\nfought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--\n\nBut the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth\npoured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and\nupon those who stood with her.He smote the\ndesk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from\nits throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had\nsigned.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the\nExpress the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the\nink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into\nhis hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational\njournals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to\nocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might\nnot secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its\noccupants into the street.It was the\nlever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted\ninhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--\n\nThat girl!That obedient lackey hastened\ninto his master\'s presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement\ncould not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I\'ll see that his\nfederal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of\nthe most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and\nbody he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And\nnow, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink\ninto oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and\nweighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always\nitched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct\nSimiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he\'s young, and got a wife and baby?Offer\nhim twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I\'m afraid it wouldn\'t do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head\ndubiously."I\'ve had men talking with him regarding the trial, and\nhe--"\n\n"Then get him over here.I\'ll see if I can\'t persuade him," growled\nAmes in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell\nwas ushered into the financier\'s private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it\'s shocking,\nterribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn\nupon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church\nof the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded\nthat I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall\nhave policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"\n\n"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a\nseries of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards\nand private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the\ntime.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going\nuntil I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had\nreverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about\nanother matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"\n\n"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician\'s constantly iterated warning; but shook\nhis head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to\nCongress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it\nregarding dispossession in cases like my own.I\'m coming back by\nmagnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a\nfund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am\nsetting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued\nAmes, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and\nclasping the financier\'s hand.One should not be too precipitate in\naccepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a\ntrifle more, Mr.There\'s the settlement home, and the commons,\nyou know, and--"\n\n"Humph!Well, we\'ll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have\nyou any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes\nbored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I\nmay--"\n\n"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this\nweek, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him\nthe true facts in regard to it.I\'ll call Hood, and we\'ll go over them\nin detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he\'s\nraising a building fund too, isn\'t he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed\nthe forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames\ndismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young\nlawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood\'s request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding\nhim, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the\nunsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the\ncountry, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their\nprofessions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than\ntake on any class of business which, though promising good money\nreturns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard\nat the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am\nparticularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"\n\n"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to\nour legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the\nmatter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man\'s eyes\nglistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I\nhave heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather\nlike the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been\ndoing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display\nof legal skill whatever."I\'d hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your\nassociation with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do\nnot intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured\nbail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,\nStolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in\nbehalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel\nfor the latter when his trial should come up."I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do, Mr.Hood\nwill take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We\'ll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don\'t mutually fit,\nwhy, we\'ll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him\nthen.But--\n\n"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood\nwould give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into\nthe harness.You\'ve had experience\nin that, eh?"That little house\nwhich he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on\nhis way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the\nstipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will\nbe with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed\nhigh at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need\nbusiness.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell\nof fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter\nyour employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and\nself respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may\nbe, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming\nassociated with Mr.But I\npledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can\nblacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become\nyour legal henchman.But there are some terms upon\nwhich even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he\nvented his great wrath upon that individual\'s bald pate."And now," he\nconcluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off\nto a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can\'t do it, then I\'ll\naccept your resignation!"Ames, I have\njust learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up\nwith that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he\'s taken some wealthy man\ndown there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor\nLafelle, and so they\'ve gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"\n\n"And they say that--"\n\n"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to\nsee that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of\naccomplishing that.I guess\nWenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a\nslight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged\nslightly.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has\ngone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_\nin the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been\nconcerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure\nagainst the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy\nand low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would\nhave been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with\nnever a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of\nwhose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it\nconverged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in\nthree continents; threads whose intricate windings led through\ntrackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut\nof poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no\nlight shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;\nback even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne\nof the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against\nthe frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to\nimitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of\nthat sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply\nbecause of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim\nwas a plain deceiver.Mingling\nhis theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the\npurpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings\nand commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of\nreligious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the\n"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique\nthat they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his\nuse of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had\nbeen drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,\ntolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people\'s interests were in the hands of the Public\nProsecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that\ngentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at\nhis right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,\nJudge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of\nwhich lay with the people.But the judge might have been still\nprosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from\nwhich he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long\nsince, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury\npanel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable\nto the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only\nthose points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the\nincrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before\nthe trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the\nperiod of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial\nwas dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were\nbound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to\nprocure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be\nrelied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And\nshe, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the\nTombs before Ames\'s eager counsel found their opportunity to confront\nher on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of\nhumiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her\nstrength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim\nand silent.And\nthey stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an\niota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy\nupon which the paper had been launched."We\'re going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the\nflag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to\nsee with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty\nwrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that\nStolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.\nshould pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim\nfrom prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz\' nephew to prison, and then roll a\nbomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial\nworld clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames\'s\nschemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in\nhis hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of\nthe Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to\nhypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of\njustice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man\'s long\nnurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and\nbusiness was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the\ndefendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,\nthe widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into\nhis net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those\nunfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the\ngreat, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish\ncaprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public\nwould now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own\nchicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly\nconfused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the\ndictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with\nhis many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little\nshort of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which\nhe had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety\nand deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a\nseasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the\ntrial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take\nthe stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause\nsuch a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to\ntake the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;\nand Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not\nthat sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the\ntottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over\nthis mock trial?But not one point would the\njudge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made\nplain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to\npermit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room\nupon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low\ninsinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company\'s affairs had\ncome through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who\nhad, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of\ndefamation of character?And the spectators\nknew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer\nstain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst\ninto tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room\ncrowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed\nhim as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge\nbroke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;\nand then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with\nseasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned\nto the stand.He turned to\nthe people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through\nthe court room.That man, sitting calm\nand unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led\nback to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried\nthe young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an\nimportant witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge\nagainst him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his\ntestimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its\nbreath."The\nlawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has\nbeen shown to be a--"\n\n"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife\'s portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_\ncried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,\nand was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman\'s shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,\nclerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to\nthe door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet\nreposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had\nbut just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then\nCass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly\ncalled Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,\nnow that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for\nlong, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the\nemotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in\nshowing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who\nhad been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,\nto be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected\nby the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be\ncalled by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,\nand from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl\'s\nalready soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,\nand tell of the girl\'s visits to his office; of her protestations of\nlove for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions\nwhich he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant\noccasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case\nseemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames\'s face,\nand then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not\nuntil Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her\ncell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17\n\n\nIn the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world\nto-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind\'s iniquity to the\nsurface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall\nbe old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep\nand mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly\nsilent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked\nalone into the crowded court room that cold winter\'s morning.And\ntheir stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what\nmanner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen\nback and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter\nceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,\nin awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury\nand wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet\nand thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful\nhead when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;\nand that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set\naside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the\nwonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who\nwould deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went\ndirectly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held\nher hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou\ndismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou\ngoest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb\nran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous\nday.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his\nhandkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd\nbent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the\nBeaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude\nburied her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning\nsoftly.A welter of conflicting emotions\nsurged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to\nthe great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this\nlone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought\nto destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she\nlooked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled\ndown from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far\nfrom well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And\nyet, judged by the world\'s standards, he had tipped the crest of\nsuccess.He was swollen\nwith wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender\nsensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he\nwas stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a\nsingle aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been\nmet.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over\nthe fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,\ndespite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great\nmight.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked\nat him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she\nsaid simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat\nwith his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;\nand Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden\nimpulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,\nher parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her\nassociation with the defendant.It was but the one she had\ntold again and again.And when\nshe had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to\nRosendo\'s share in the mining project which had ultimated in this\nsuit.A far-away look came into the girl\'s eyes as she spoke of that great,\nblack man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm\nheart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of\nhis selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing\nalone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,\nbending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those\nghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised\nabove her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard\nthroughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by\nconflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared\nhis throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer\nat length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was\nlargely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself\ntogether, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution\neagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may\nbring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far\nback in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,\n"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the\nrich man\'s vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so\ninsolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and\nhis mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to\nescape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect\nthe destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven\neven here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and\ntransmitted his master\'s instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and\nthe hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter\nof some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"\n\nCass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the\nissue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your\nfather, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been\naccepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you\nnot?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward\nthe high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also\ntrue that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as\na pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,\nhad bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy\nfor him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent\ngirl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,\noh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to\nprove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without\nwaiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted\nby Madam Cazeau, down on--"\n\nHe stopped short.The girl\'s eyes were looking straight into his, and\nthey seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said\ngently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in\nshame.Ames alone\nmet his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the\nattack.What possible relation to the\nissue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit\ndown, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out\nfacts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,\nMiss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at\nAvon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a\nconsistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding\nothers from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the\nmotives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the\nthings he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I\nsuppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to\nindustrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she\nsaid gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects\nand churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the\nfads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus\nof Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God\'s image, but only\nstood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind\nthis counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"\n\n"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss\nAriza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:\n\n"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and\nwords.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the\nintolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human\nhypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the \'Who shall be greatest?\'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;\nbut he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to\nwork and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness\nand its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of\nto-day do not do that.Their\nkingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,\nand by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence\nof thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish\nthem!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of\nhis prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all\nto confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked\nblankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another\nquestion."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"\n\n"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and\nsteady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see\nin those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had\npassed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to\nrelieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his\nwonted witticisms.But the effect was not\nwhat he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending\nfar over his desk.And the elder\nKetchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he\nsaw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the\nunfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself\nwith those who oppose the nation\'s industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and\nEllis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country\'s\nresources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for\nexample, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon\nthe room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,\nwho, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the\nboll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that\nfell crashing upon Ames\'s straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;\nthen sprang to his feet.He held out a\nhand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss\nAriza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a\nwitness."I should\nlike to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles\nat the young lawyer."I stand on--"\n\n"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for\nthe prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to\nyour parentage.Will you--"\n\nThe judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening\nvoice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of\nwild, infuriated passion.Carmen\nsat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was\nfondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first\ntime she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and\nit had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she\nhave thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs\nthe night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had\ncalled for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the\nslender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down\nlovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt\nand absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their\npictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in\nNew York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood\nbending over the faces of the girl\'s earthly parents, portrayed in the\nstrange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years\nbefore.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air\nitself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day\nand in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass\'s shoulder at the\nlocket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words\ngibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman\'s portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_\n\nThe piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul\'s\ndespairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,\nthrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he\npeered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,\nabsorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to\ngrasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl\'s.His mouth opened, and flapped like\na broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then\ndropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;\nstraightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed\nto the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through\nthe great room like an echo of Satan\'s plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs\nand tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly\nclearing away in the dim light that winter\'s morning.Through them the\nwhite-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the\nbar.He tore it from Hood\'s hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with\nexcitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:\n\n"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman\'s\nportrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,\ndaughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"\npointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her\nchair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father\nis the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18\n\n\nBorne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_\nflashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the\nseas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;\nand old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled\nshrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,\nwho threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,\nthe bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against\nthe panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish\nenergy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half\ndragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien\'s\narms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the\ndoor; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable\nto take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied\nMonsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor\'s\nbrain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express\nwould bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean\nto the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and\nadmitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure\nchemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might\nbe cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood\nforth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture\nshowed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was\nunmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the\nchurchman\'s arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal\nGallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the\nsad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the\nAmes yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little\ninformation.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a\nlover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe\nwas taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said\nthat it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled\nhim from Isabella\'s court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in\nEurope.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the\none from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he\nmet the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal\nbirth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he\nwas seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father\'s sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a\nprospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who\nknows how long?she was wild\nto do such a thing.She died at the little\nriverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle\nsuggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his\nname was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his\nyouth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego\'s name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name\nin the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim\nupon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but\na princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room\nand tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the\ndoors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the\ngreat body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,\ngesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and\ncorridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they\nformed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic\nevents but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar\ngaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the\nBeaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest\nat Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the\nhour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass\'s arm.The judge had\nordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering\nconcourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the\nlittle Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,\nJude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the\ntelephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for\nHaynerd had left him at the editor\'s desk in his own absence.But with\nthe return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded\nthe chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through\nthe door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her\nto his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only\npretended before, didn\'t we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the\nworld to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the\nmighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to\nbring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might\nglory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about\nthe room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I\ncalled you that from the very first.And he--that\nman--your father!"It--"\n\nThen the Beaubien\'s heart almost stopped.What,\nthen, would this sudden turn in the girl\'s life mean to the lone woman\nwho clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"\n\nShe stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue\npalace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which\nan eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left\nside, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and\nthe fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through\nthe dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when\nhe awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its\nghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He\nthought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black\nhours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the\ndesign of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his\nconquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man\nplotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest\nhe ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little\nskulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over\nthe great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red\ndollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over\nthe rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the\ntoilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are\nTruth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls\nat the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked\ndown at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times\nare so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,\nfor the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great\nman howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote\nhis companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of\nthe quivering corpse.And then he sought to\nmount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,\nslimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling\ntreasures.The naked, splitting skulls\nleered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets\nglowed eerily.He begged that a rope be\nlowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the\nchill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It\nmocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore\nhis hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for\nfreedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the\nblood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he\nheard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,\nthat they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;\nhis reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which\nhe had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he\nheard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on\nthe top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I\n  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved\n  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he\nsought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream\ntore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and\nsought to soothe his mental agony.The man\'s torture was fearful to\nbehold; his weakness, pitiable.But the\nsleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the\ncourse of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their\nhands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained\nroom.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now\nhe was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses\nwhich he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh\ngraves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed\nhe peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in\nturn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he\nroamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and\nthe hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked\nwith great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,\nsuddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,\npenciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion\nthat was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed\nfrom it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into\neternal blackness filled with dying men\'s groans!The exhausted attendants stood about\nthe bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in\nconsultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they\nsat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to\nlift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the\npatient\'s hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and\nnurses."Let us ask God\'s help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;\nprayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take\npity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare\nhim for Jesus\' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then\nDoctor Morton\'s heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"\nhe said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure\nthat man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister\'s face; but he did\nnot reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be\nhopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red\neyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"\nturning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send\nfor--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would\nonly further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is\ndoomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall\nretire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it\nmyself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a\ntelephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory\norder that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending\nfor her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"\n\n"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn\'t know--that\nthere was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from\nthe table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung\nwide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the\nsick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he\n_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her\nmagnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid\nevents of the past few hours swept over her, and she became\nembarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and\nstared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,\nbut you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon\nme."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to\nthe bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the\nattendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed\nthe door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19\n\n\nA curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human\nmind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in\nthat dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When\ntwilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,\nshrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly\nopened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness\nshe saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man\'s right hand\nclasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And\nthe nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave\nbut for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the\ntelephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came\nagain.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but\nsaid little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where\nthe scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no\nquestions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man\nwho, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,\nhad destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would\nlive--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that\nKathleen Ames had left her father\'s roof--left in humiliation and\nchagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had\ngone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of\nAltern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with\nhim the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of\nsuffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay\nfor a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then\nWillett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his\nmaster\'s scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the\nwires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought\nFather Danny in the master\'s private car to the great metropolitan\nhospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers\non the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution\nwhich held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books\nand forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered\nover him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the\nglowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening\nhair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he\nhad opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was\nsaid that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when\nthe sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had\nreached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down\nupon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had\nsaid, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the\ndistant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,\nno one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of\nPadre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark\ndays.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed\nand placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into\nthe conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his\nhand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who\nmarked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon\nthe girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering\nfeebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new\nlife, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;\nand, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have\nquickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,\nwhereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood\nalways before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with\nhorrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his\nerstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first\norders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down\nupon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the\nfuture.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold\ninterests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was\nhe still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the\nAmes money had purchased?The\nAmalgamated Spinners\' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his\nmining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling\nschemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,\nbank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for\nadmission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that\na marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and\nWaite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter\'s wide business\nexperience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and\nshe threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the\nhounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like\nAmes, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,\nand yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of\npolitics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening\nof the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now\nsat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great\nleader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the\nbeginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects\nof a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with\nhim, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they\nshook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must\nknow that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come\nthe complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing\ngambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the\nvery necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,\nand out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation\nsat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged\nwith disease-laden profits from the sales of women\'s bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations\nof religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect\nthe benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle\'s awful\nquestion: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now\nashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_\n\nAnd then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but\nthe girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent\nlow over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl\'s\nparentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he\nwho, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the\nsupposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York\nto confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen\'s connection with the\nmystery.And now--\n\nBut the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when\nhe kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she\nloved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the\nspirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable\nmessage from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to\nthe lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he\nread it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and\nCaptain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three\nmen sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word\nhe spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,\nthen our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing\nto her regarding him.Wenceslas has\nwon--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,\nMcCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them\nfrom their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate\nthis wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to\nkeep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"\n\n"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We\nwill be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"\n\n"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away\nfrom those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man\'s eyes glistened like live coals, and\nhis sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out\nof New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she\nhad entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a\nmessage down to the waiting engineer:\n\n"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20\n\n\nCartagena\'s slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years\nof civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned\nconvent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the\nmessage down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the\nnorthern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet\ndreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political\nfactions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause\nof Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the\ncouncils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political\nagitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout\'s\nmessage was received with indifference, even though he embellished it\nwith the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of\nthe regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the\nBoca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,\nand came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the\nancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore\nwatched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous\nofficials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly\nawaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and\nheaded for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to\nthem to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many\ntourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena\'s\nwonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying\nmementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to\nthese waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,\nthere was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that\nrose from its funnels evidenced the owner\'s intention of spending some\ntime in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive\nwall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the\ngay throngs that were entering upon the day\'s festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and\nlingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his\nway up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of\nthe famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to\ntime his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and\nstarted in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was\nevident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to\npursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store\nwhich had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and\nselected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them\ninto his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a\npowerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed\nwith embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I\nforget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his\neye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an\nIndian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by\nprofession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that\nname.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross\nthe _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of\nthe history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great\nfavor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments\nlater they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,\ncommenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of\nintroduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to\nlet."The other is--"\n\nHe stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a\ncasual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and\nJose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down\nhere, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that\'s all," returned Hitt, at a loss\nfor a suitable answer."You didn\'t happen to know these men, I\npresume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such\nquestions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of\nthese troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,\nflicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But\nI--"\n\n"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man\nwho explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for\nyou are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,\n"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"\n\n"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"\n\n"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"\n\n"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you\nsay he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,\nby bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in\ngood standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it\nwas flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was\ninterested?"She went to the great States\nfrom which you come.And I think little was heard from her after\nthat."She lived with--"\n\n"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would\nlike a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"\n\nHitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning\nhim to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous\nthoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at\nfrequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great\nenclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into\nit, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and\nleave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered\nfortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position\nthey commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far\nout over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep\nin the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is\na girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out\nthere in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter\nof old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his\nsanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"\n\n"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and\nlowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por\nsupuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas\nhas had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando\'s are just above the water\'s edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"\n\n"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in\nSimiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"\n\n"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the\nsilent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood\nlooking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and\npeered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms\nof the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be\nreached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try\nlifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the\nfallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage\nthat led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a\nlong, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,\nbrick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth\nat a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,\nfollowed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted\ntheir faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at\nthem, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely\nabout him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they\nwere left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring\nmadly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had\nfallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon\nit and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into\nthe foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow\naperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of\nterrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and\nbleeding."Now let\'s get out of this\nmiserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from\nhis clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the\nyacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at\nseven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,\nDon Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city\nalone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled\nin the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the\nterms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was\nbrought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt\nannouncement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,\nimpossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his\ncoming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled\nover the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and\nin the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the\nsettlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,\nhe had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his\nmind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_\nin Cartagena\'s harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed\nuntil he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message\nto the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding\nits master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the\nCathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with\nhis thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,\nbut unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him\nat once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon\nto render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the\nsinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own\nadvantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his\nown keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had\ncircled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had\nfound his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans\nhad outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,\nRincon!He would meet the financier--but\nnot until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated\narrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again\ndespatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that\nmessenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the\ntall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in\nwhose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had\nalready arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a\ntorrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the\nswelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow\nalong the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the\ndriving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the\nwater\'s surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths\nand grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric\nlantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,\nstanding in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled\nform of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid\nhold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands\nstretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was\ninserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of\nthe straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped\nfrom the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes\nupward.His\nthrobbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the\nwater at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a\ngroaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the\nblackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He\nturned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood\nupon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope\nand excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without\nseized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed\nthrough the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *\n\nCartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of\nexcitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its\nvictims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that\ngraceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,\ncould not but be associated with that most daring deed of the\npreceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest\nand political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,\ngesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly\nvoiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing\nasleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and\nsedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,\ntheir mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to\nconfront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the\nhand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications\nwould wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid\ncongressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a\nwounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too\nnumerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid\nlibrary of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single\nvalet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him\nand his great country in these black charges.He had come on a\npeaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at\nthat moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception\nwas this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of\nthe powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall\nAmerican who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed\narchaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless\nmumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,\nvisit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled\nwith wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into\nits every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the\nfair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to\nthe master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer\ncurling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a\nmeaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,\nalone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman\nin his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at\nWashington some--"\n\n"Enough!""I sent for you\nyesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then\nwhich would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me\nuntil you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and\ndevilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who\npossessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass\nthat for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have\nfurnished you.He held out some typewritten\nsheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a\nsmile."The terms on which\npeace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"\n\n"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of\nstate prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night\nquite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the\nweak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change\nof heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a\nstate prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a\nshare of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk\nexposure of your part in this four years\' carnage?""Wenceslas," he\nsaid, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce\nall claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad\nmine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old\nRosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its\npossession must remain with her and her associates.There is no\nrecord, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church\npossesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed\nWenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to\ncontest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The\ntitle to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed\nthe call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge\nentered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the\nhand.He knew not the man; but the boy\nwas a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge\'s steady words fell upon the churchman\'s ears like a\nsentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night\nthat the lad\'s mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"\n\n"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man\nwho gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was\nPadre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and\nthen at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don\nJorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas\nfound a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don\nJorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered\nthe boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff\nturned back to the yacht.There were some who\nremembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a\ndark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young\nnewsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them\nat the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said\nthey saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who\ndiscovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon\nthe floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his\nheart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful\nsight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had\nthe escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had\nentered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and\nin the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting\nthe broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit\nto the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His\nGrace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the\nGovernor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his\nonly reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained\nand absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of\ndelight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down\nand ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack\'s_\nfunnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were\nbidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into\nthe night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep\nhealths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little\nrepublic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they\ndrank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a\nlittle boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the\nladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear\nhatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after\nmidnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the\nechoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,\nthe _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its\ncourse for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent\nwaves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week\nhidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful\nsmoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured\nin the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the\ndoor opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms\nclosed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during\nthe four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the\ndoor through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile\nback at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud\nexclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked\nwonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is\nAnita\'s babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its\nhair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21\n\n\nAnother summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park\nthe afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn\nleaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell\nlike a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking\nunsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose\nbeauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off\nlike a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily\nduring the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl\nlaughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man\'s control\nbecame firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to\nmanifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her\nboy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off\nwith love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in\nalone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich\nman\'s life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled\ndaily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the\ntransformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former\nvigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of\ngrief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his\nrecords for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly\nwrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond\nhis power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on\nAvon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,\nhe would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his\nhands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from\nwhom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,\nand the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in\nColombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the\nrich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean\npolicies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new\nlocation, far from the old-time "lungers\' alley," long rows of little\ncottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been\nremoved, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father\nDanny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared\nhope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that\nin the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known\nthat but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of\nsunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled\nfor him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull\nmonths he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country\nfields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he\ncould have but known that he was his brother\'s keeper, and in a sense\nthat the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his\nfellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster\nof glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There\nabout that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with\ntheir number augmented now in ways of which they could not have\ndreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking\nagain as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a\ncure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every\nsocial, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,\ndisease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even\nthe tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the\ngirl who came among us to\'show the world what love will do\' has\ntaught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,\nthe covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous\nChrist-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world\'s troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,\nbut of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the\nreal man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The\ntrusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches\nare not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have\'missed\nthe mark\' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must\ngrope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing\nto turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in\nthe reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as\nmen join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly\nunite to solve the world\'s sore problems and reveal the waiting\nkingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man\nwho hears the tempter, the carnal mind\'s suggestion to enrich himself\nmaterially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the\nvoice of mesmerism, that\'man-killer from the beginning\', which bids\nhim sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The\nsociety woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of\nfashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,\nand whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for\n\'who shall be greatest\' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must\nlearn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but\nmesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in\njoy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of\ngood, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric\nlie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine\nknowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the\nblind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are\ngathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen\nPresence which makes for righteousness, know now that \'in my flesh\nshall I see God,\' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal\nwinds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his\nside told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison\nopened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the\nChrist.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a\ndove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,\nerror, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was\nmade to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years\ngone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and\nnone else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he\nhad looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human\nconcept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the\nwilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see\nLife.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his\ncaptivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His\nstore of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge\nhad rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly\nfalse.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified\nSelf, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it\nreaches out for Truth.Only a\nstate of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And\nwe are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with\nits sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness\nis mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that\nharmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the\nfalse sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation\npossible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding\nour mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and\nevil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding\nbrings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that\nthe kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality\nwithin each one of us.By removing hampering\nfalse belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human\nopinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of\nmankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and\nits inevitable death.Mankind\'s chief difficulty is ignorance of what\nGod is.He proved Him to be the\ncreator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie\nof materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the\nfalse belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a\nsense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,\nexcept the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of\nwhich the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of\nunderstanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in\nthe stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of\nattempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations\nof God\'s omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind\nfrom accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after\nnineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind\nremains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the\nconsentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus\nshowed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs\nin matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted \'the flesh\'; he\nshowed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed\nthat the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we\nknow from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_\nof things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental\nconcepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the\nmark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives\nthan wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach\nGod through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,\nand He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a\nconsciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let\nLife, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that\nman to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human\nbeliefs of mortals--buried beneath \'the lie\' which mankind accept\nabout truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity\'s\ndire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of\nactual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,\nand quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the\nworks of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who\ndoes not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized\necclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has\nfailed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and\nimperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,\nwhich cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute\nbeneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never\nsought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human\nmind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of\ncrisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called\nculture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient\nhuman conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of \'the\nFathers,\' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have\nbeen molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been\npersuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a\nrealm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward\noblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is\na gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by\nnations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to\nbless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence\nremains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter\na mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was\ndiscord.He who indulges evil only\nproves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not\n\'mental suggestion,\' wherein all thought is material.When evil\nthinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will\ndisappear from consciousness.Behind all\nthat the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual\nfact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this\nfact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,\nwhose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil\nas an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they\nmust know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will\ncause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and\ncopy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better\nbeliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted\nreality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The \'old\nman\' will have given place to the \'new.\'Yes, for the present we reckon with material\nsymbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,\nif we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and\nits pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the\nSermon on the Mount.He who thinks\nright shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to\nknow them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,\neven in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the\ndemonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from\nprejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,\nthankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It\nalone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in\nour many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the\nuniverse and all things is true, then are the things with which men\nnow occupy themselves worth while?But are the\nthings which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have\nbeen demonstrated.Carmen has\nshown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely\nnatural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She\nhas shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost\nin accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law\nthan His.But--\n\n"\'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create\nevil,\' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional\nopposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we\ncall death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test\nof a Christian is in the\'signs following.\'Without them his faith is\nbut sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept\nwhom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."\'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein\n  is he to be accounted of?"\'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very\n  day his thoughts perish."\'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born\n  of the Spirit is spirit."\'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though\n  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we\n  him no more.\'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned\noff the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery\nblaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing\ntreasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter\'s hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had\nsent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady\nand low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am\nresigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I\ncould live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed\nthrough death into life!This little girl\'s mother knew not, nor did\nI, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the\nsun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was\nArgus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I\nwas young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these\nyears since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered\nthe agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon\nme and smote me sore--\n\n"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre\nRafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the\nworld, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to\nColombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me\ntimber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of\nthe city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,\nwhom she would not leave in Spain--\n\n"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would\nnot take a wife back with me!And I kissed\nher tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make\nher happy.And then--\n\n"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused\ninquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old\nnurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been\nleft at Badillo to die.She was\ntimid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage\nhere would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know\nnot why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass\nset in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it\nand cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I\nmust have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like\nGoliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to\npowder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little\ngirl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would\nthat she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid\ndown his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn\nfrom my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up\nthe Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and\ndevastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their\ndesolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son\never cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen\nwhom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him\nto lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,\nwe had not told him.And how inextricably\nbound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the\nwoman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and\nwhose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the\nfaithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"\n\nThe girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained\nsat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but\nthey saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls\ndrifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in\nthe dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the\nshadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming\npast.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the\nnameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the\ngirl\'s lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the\ndistant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender\ncaress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment\nabove them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low\nweeping in the room.For\n\n  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have\n  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the\n  Lamb."GLOSSARY\n\n\nA\n\na buen precio, for a good price.adioscito, good-bye (used among intimates).alcalde, mayor, chief of village.algarroba, the carob-tree bean.alpargates, hempen sandals.anisado,

away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described\nthe most profound silence reigned in the soldier\'s humble dwelling.A\nflickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,\nbetrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy\nrecess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except\nby this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with\nthe roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so\nnearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be\nseated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl\nwas carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a\nlinen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple\ncalix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were\nfeebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who\nhad taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks\nwere downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one\nhand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened\nwith painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of\nAgricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,\nusually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion\nby which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a\nletter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by\npost in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the\nhousekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some\ntrivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his\nfamily.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly\nopened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low\nvoice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But\nwhat is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she\nhastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the\nlight, and read what follows:\n\n"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the\nsisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of\nto-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied\namazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his\neyes:-"The song, entitled \'Working-men Freed,\' has been declared\nlibellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a\nsecret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as\nbeing concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who\nwas lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,\ndoubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses\nbreathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found\namong the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the\nletter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:\n\n"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo\ndoubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be\nwell if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in\norder that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to\ntrial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,\nwhose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment\'s silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance\nresumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good\nMother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on\nme.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the\ntime.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating\ntone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and\nlisten to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two\nmonths since my song was published.It is not in any way political;\nindeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming\ndown on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is\nscarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very\nneighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the\nverses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the\npossession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more\nis necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the\nlove of labor and of goodness!If so, justice\nwould be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be\nnecessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim\'s staff to guide her\nsteps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on\nhearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to\nme!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you\ndo also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor\nlaborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;\nyou recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble\nheart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and\nthe wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your\nwishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than\nyou, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these\ntimes of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than\nthat numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the\npersons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an\nexcellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view\nwith more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And\nthen, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite\ninsignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for\nconspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and\nhe was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has\nfurnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the\nletter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be\nnaturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,\nand poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them\nwithout you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the\nletter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error\nthough it be, is not the less cruel.But they don\'t commit a man without\nhearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,\nbitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his\ndaily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in\nprison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my\nmother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family\nuntil the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.\nHardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,\nthat, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their\npersecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a\njourney with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,\nadded: "But no!After all, I had\nrather await what may come.I\'ll at least have the chance of proving my\ninnocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it\nbe that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my\nfamily will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen\nto-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep\nso joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch\'s fears were too well-founded, for it will be\nrecollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue\ndes Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made\namong the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against\ndemocratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some\nseconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an\nindefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she\nshowed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with\nso much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a\ngenerous heart.You must apply to her--"\n\nWith these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort\nover herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in\nher life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman\nwas so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she\nidolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done\nwith this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "\'Remember my name; and\nin all circumstances address yourself to me?\'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful\nconnections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to\nmorrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her\nsupport.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had\nsaved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for\nhim.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your\ninnocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you\nwill have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person\nto whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what\ncould possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you\nunderstand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose\nthat you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety\nfor you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your\nemployment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,\nAgricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is\nnoble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is\ngenerous.The required surety will be\nas nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be\nthe very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and\ndejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the\nyoung lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will\nindeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I\'d never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I\nrendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the\nservices which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust\nto me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is\ntrue, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any\nother person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am\nsure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far\nabove me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;\nyes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel\none; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that\nwhich I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly\nconsume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so\nheart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which\nthis unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,\nmade of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent\nyouth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,\nholding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,\n"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and\ndelicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those\nof a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over\ninto making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de\nCardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,\nthe sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely\nsweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally\ndevoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,\nthey sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the\nworld is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and\naffection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably\nblissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to\nhardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of\nthemselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young\nlady\'s house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I\'ll go down to watch at the\nstreet-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you\nof what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your\nfather," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,\nis so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your\npresent concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola\'s garret, that he and\nthe sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:\n\n"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is\nover; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet\nhim.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether\nor not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress\'s\napartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest\nits noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,\ngayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my\ndear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not\nseen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a\nnew pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be\nlike seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola\'s garret\nbeing now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed\nnot an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in\norder that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite\nof her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to\nsink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the\nconversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom\nshe secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she\npossessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she\nloved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that\nshe should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found\nconsolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,\nshe rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order\nto see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear\nand cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola\'s\ngarret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be\nseen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the\nsewing-girl\'s.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which\nAgricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a\nnail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the\npeople revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has\ndelighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their\nreverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had\nalready risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his\ninquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number\nof precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of\nAgricola\'s song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the\ndisconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the\nyoung blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,\nsuspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the\nedge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had\ndressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both\nthose of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to\ndiscontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I\nwished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in\nfull day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear\nmoustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;\nhave you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That\'s right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look\nye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good\nfor nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old\ncarbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;\nand then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is\nsomething good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for\nthe cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this\nis but the beginning!I am like the famished\nwretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and\nlittle that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to\nbe tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,\nI wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and\nperplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed\nthat they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was\nmenaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good\nto you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more\nequitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in\nhis factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies\nof Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what\naffection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;\nwho work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor\npleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,\nhe accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;\nwhence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that\nis not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in\nwhich all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful\nand salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an\nassociation.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"\nobserved Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good\nmother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a\nsigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have\nsuffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well\nin the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You\nshall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in\nbeholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold\nfather and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You\nwill write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his\ngrand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should\nhasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which\nare of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down\nto say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes\nto be regular at that: the good soul!and\nduring her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of\nmy power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to\nattend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required\nin a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.\nHardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought\nto make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must\nbe deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which\nsustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and\nspoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put\noff for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only\nhoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l\'amour et cogni--I mean--my\nAgricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his\nson\'s shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one\nmoment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now\nthat I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of\nbusiness.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in\nParis?""I don\'t know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and\nby order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some\nimportant papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this\nnotary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his\naddress in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my\njourney; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,\nthat if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect\nit."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He\ninvoluntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had\nnot perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed\nhat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,\nwere two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as\nthought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,\nwhile they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes\nbecome moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the\nyoung men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and\naspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola\ncontrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at\nlength."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a\nhundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping\nfor it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands\nof Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a\nhundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting\nhis fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of\nineffable affection, Dagobert added:\n\n"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel\nhas the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he\nsaved the lives of Marshal Simon\'s daughters, and tried to save mine\nalso."suddenly exclaimed\nAgricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the\nmissionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly\nbeneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through\nwhich shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which\nextended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting\nevents which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near\nCardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with\nGabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the\nyoung missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,\nDagobert said:\n\n"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with\nrenewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest\nheld out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has\nwounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the\nmissionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of\nwounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken\ndown alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon\nwhich the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and\nagony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to\nthis upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands\nhave been pierced through!and Agricola became\ngrievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment\nof modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky\nMountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when\nProvidence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a\nsufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;\n"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it\nthat they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,\nscarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own\nsense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be\nimplanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion\nthat the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in\nhim, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the\nblessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which\nwas uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism\nthus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now\ncontemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration\nand respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite\nunconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his\ntwo friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:\n"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to\nbe about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don\'t you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took\nwith transport both of Gabriel\'s hands), "that these wounds are as\nglorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by\nprofession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,\nwith enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their\nresignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have\ngone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under\nthe eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with\nme?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self\npreservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the\nshouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes\nof the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,\nwhich bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state\nthat I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every\none--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough\nhide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you\nnot a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,\nunarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those\nwhom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by\nartillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to\nGabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify\nwhat was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have\nhearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the\nmost admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,\nalone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity\nand Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await\ndeath and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,\nwithout hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness\nissuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and\nthis in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your\nmagnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you\nwere rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black\nrobe!can you still contend that you are not\nas brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a\nthankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never\nchange his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to\nDagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense\nawaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I\nwill not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would\nbe at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like\nGabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much\nvirtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood\ninsolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind\ndevotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who\nare inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly\nlawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their\nvocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand\nenfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we\nare, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your\nambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you\nunderstand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"\nand then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change\nthe conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:\nbe more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your\ncourage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the\nspectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling\nheart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,\nlooked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most\nsurprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind\nwhat I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I\nadvanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night\nafter a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by\nnight,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our\npossession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of\nthe slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of\nmy old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has\nrestored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious\nwhirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,\n\'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?\'But this\nfeeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following\nmorning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once\nmore to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm\nbecame weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my\nhorse, I have said to myself, \'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old\nsoldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during\nthe solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man\nis left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his\nbosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are\ngreatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have\nnever abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the\nclaws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,\nthat the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my\nrequest, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied\nthe missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to\nmake you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived\nby a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I\nawaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must\nhave been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has\nremained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I\nshould have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"\n\nDagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he\nalso had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had\nfreed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,\nyoung and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, \'I am the sister of the\ndistressed!\'"asked Dagobert, singularly\ninterested."\'I go wheresoever there is suffering,\' she replied," answered\nthe missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of\nAmerica--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,\nwhere the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also\nto have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means\ndid this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was\nheard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the\nfears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted\nbrother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to\nspeak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch\'s voice, and opened the door.But\nthe young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark\npassage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour\nsince broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have\nbeen watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing\nalarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure\nyou, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But\nI could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been\nstated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father\nand me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your\nmother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young\nladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother\nhas requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not\ndelay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came\nto arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should\ndepart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were\nforgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,\nperhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to\nyourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I\'ll come down."I\'ll come up\nagain to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,\nto resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his\ngarret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received\nthis letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:\n\n"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon\nwith an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your\nhusband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres\nwithout a moment\'s delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to\nno other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General\nSimon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can\nhave told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you\ntransmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address\nwas Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,\n"if he has some important documents, why didn\'t he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as\npossible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would\nwithdraw his father for about two days, during which time his\n(Agricola\'s) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it\nis not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is\nrequired on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall\nbe back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for\nChartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and\nGabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them\ncompany.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This\nvisit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not\npossible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing\na sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again\ninto this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something\nin thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the\nshipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you\nenrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of\nthe name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in\nCardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return\nthanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the\nperson to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady\nshould be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made\nto Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is\nalready late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o\'clock."This party is adjourned till my\nreturn from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the\nlatter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him\nto shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him\nsolemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished\nboth the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I\nhave come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall\nhave need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"\nadded Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of\nhonor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I\nnot?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will\nyou come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the\naccents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If\nhe should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,\nwhat could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon\nus," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father\nand a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I\'ll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest\'s\nrobe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,\nthat you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and\nfearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A\nFATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually\nincreasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de\nCardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,\nin Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing\nthan the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with\nsmall squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre\neffect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which\nthe fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected\nin the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was\nsurmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which\nwas reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which\nan arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front\noverlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,\non this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,\nformed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great\nhabitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the\ngarden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a\nrotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its\nerection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the\nstones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of\nflowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de\nCardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a\nperistyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,\nlighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of\nsmaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or\ntransformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,\nthe black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the\nentire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built\nglistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect\ncontrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity\nof an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic\nclumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following\nthat of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in\nthe Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a\nneighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue\nsky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of\nverdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the\nrays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon\ntwo charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place\nin the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its\nown, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them\na young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that\nbreed of spaniels called King Charles\'s, made their appearance under the\nperistyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the\nbeautiful little spaniel\'s was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth\nyear.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady\'s maid of Marivaux, a\nmore mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth\nmore white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or\nform smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,\nGeorgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,\nwith flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with\nrose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful\nfair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray\nlevantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large\ntuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a\nhollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,\nsurmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and\nflexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,\nallowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,\nreaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When\nGeorgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more\nquickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky\'s indifferent eyes a beautiful\nankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in\nwhite silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish\nsatin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when\nvivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a\njoyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless\nfor the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady\'s-maid, who on the previous evening had\nintroduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the\nHonorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint\nDizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak\nbut joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was\nnot much bigger than one\'s fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,\nshone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her\nneck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery\ntan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her\nlarge eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that\nthey trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and\npetulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after\nthe happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon\nthe greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,\nwho advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly\nstopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in\nadvance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held\nherself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up\nof the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,\nthough of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy\nconsisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the\ncolor of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was\npot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;\nhe walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air\nof a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs\nsallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and\naltogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a\n"church-goer\'s pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a\nwoman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was\ndressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay\nand showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat\nof the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in\nher youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,\nwhich were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and\naustere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and\ndiscreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess\nSaint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two\nwomen present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even\nto the animals which attended them.There were similar differences\nbetween Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When\nthe latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a\nmovement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the\nyoung lady\'s maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the\napparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,\nand even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the\ncur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of\ndistress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly\nsaid to Georgette:\n\n"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog\nthus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly\nanimal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky\nyesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,\nand brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to\nwhat, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal\na smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It\nregards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to\nherself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight\nstart of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied\nwith watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl\nat with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome\nher temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very\nlate last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid\nday.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order\nof the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken\nyour mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one\'s orders in her own house; and I will\nnot disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied\nGeorgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the\nsaloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne\nbe entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the\nPrincess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my\nmistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her\nniece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer\nrespects her aunt\'s orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained\npersons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if\nfor ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest\ncoquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess\'s women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having\nbeen handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even\nunto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a\nhundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the\nutmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess\'s house, who has\ntoo many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought\nnot to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"\n\n"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o\'clock--"\n\n"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the\nhouse.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,\nand directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter\'s\nlodge window; and at one o\'clock in the morning, the cab was still\nstationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the\ncloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing\nthe name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the\nPrincess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the\nmiddle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris\nof General Simon\'s daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it\nnecessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her\nshoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not\ncome here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will\nyou, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me\nto enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a\nspot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,\nterminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,\nextending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her\ngait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o\'clock in the\nmorning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into\nfits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my\nstory of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"\n\n"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that\nopen\'s on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is\nby that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments\nhave not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her\nniece\'s caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,\nthough I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe\nit!""Since you\'ve gone so far, ma\'am, I now insist upon conducting you into\nthe apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by\nyour own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by\nthis time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"\n\n"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor\nHebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end\nto this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has\npassed.Re-enter at eight o\'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own\neyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be\nexpected.All those to whom I am\ngoing to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all\nastonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her\nfat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in\norder to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or\nfancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to\nhave seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of\nSaint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,\nthe following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the\nlight some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss\nde Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined\nto a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an\ninsatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and\nbeautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the\nsculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne\ndid the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites\nin the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to\ngratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,\nthe cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh\nvoice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or\none nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from\nthe sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of\ntheir sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally\nwith the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,\nalas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She\nvalued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the\ndelicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous\ncluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She\nsought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She\nwould have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by\nexcesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which\nto exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the\nexcessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and\nEVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to\nthe adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad\npassion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are\nin themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the\nexpression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification\nof SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken\nsensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the\nnecessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite\nsensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady\'s character was extreme.Certain\nhumiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,\nabove all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to\nresolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish\nthat it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her\naudacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well\nas in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and\nblindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose\npiquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who\nentertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either\nplaced very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met\nin the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she\nresided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into\nthe presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the\nbath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to\nrepresent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred\nin the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in\nParis, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne\'s dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one\nerected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker\nwho has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,\nor to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the\ncontact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,\nwith fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she\nmay enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the\nsplendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own\nperfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this\nsemicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived\nfor the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls\nof the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth\nof the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of\nAdrienne\'s dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a\nsingle large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of\nground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between\nthese two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with\nfurze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round\nthe ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet\ndamask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest\nstyle, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended\nover the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,\nmarvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and\ndecorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne\'s dressing\ncase, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large\ntablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids\nprecisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other\nimplements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of\nmother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in\nextraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique\npurity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place\nof a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed\nevery day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in\ndiameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,\nfilled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed\na sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the\nfarther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,\nsurrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the\nenchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful\nmodesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported\nthose two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with\nsmall figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet\nof gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two\nfrosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent\ndrawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting\nof portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles\nof oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver\ngilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich\ndivan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture\nof this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the\nsweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated\nbefore her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or\nrather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was\nwith the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished\nthe young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with\nattention and with a charming originality.We have already seen\nGeorgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an\nintriguing lady\'s maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite\nequal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,\nwith the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a\nlong golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to\nfacilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her\ncharming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the\nVenetian painters.Her slender waist curved\nin from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five\nminute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne\'s\nwomen had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so\npleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of\nHebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her\ncharming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The\nphysiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On\ntheir features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing\nand hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded\ndeference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the\nzealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon\nAdrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of\ndeference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from\nthe services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have\nthought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her\nperson all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a\nwork of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they\nwere stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the\nwindow.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more\nthan usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,\nembroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her\nwaist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve\nyears, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and\nflexible as a bird\'s, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,\nand all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the\ncomparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling\nwhiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,\nthat some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots\nof her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,\nlike pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to\nauburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the\nroseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her\nnails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every\nspot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,\ncould make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it\nproclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her\nglorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now\nthey glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and\nwit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and\nswimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep\na black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a\ndelightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to\ncontrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those\nof ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect\noval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of\nher teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth\nvoluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles\nand delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to\nbehold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more\nelegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck\nand the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness\nof many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da\nVinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more\ndelightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating\nmass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when\nlet loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,\nlike another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,\nAdrienne\'s tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,\nstood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her\nsmall white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent\nbrightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady\'s-maid\npulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves\nof that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a\nthousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all\ndirections.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays\nfrom numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne\'s\nforehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed\nthe risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they\nadapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the\nbeautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and\nhaving upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied\nherself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and\ncrossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh\ncolor, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled\nbox, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling\nhands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their\nextremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her\nmistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe\nthe different operations of Adrienne\'s toilette with grave and reflective\nattention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign\nfrom her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon\na small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on\nher shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took\nthe letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,\nand read aloud as follows:\n\n"HONORED MADAME,\n\n"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you\nwith respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count\nand Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,\nwith probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in\nour old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute\nof all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my\nfather, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and\ntheir probity."She continued:\n\n"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;\nbut it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the\nconsequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase\nour bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in\npoverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because\nit has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted\nfrom us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin\ncame here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself\nanew; "the secretary of Abbe d\'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him\nbeing engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and\nthat he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if\nwe would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the\nnew proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain\nthis end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and\nexcellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and\nto relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to\nacknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much\nas possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious\npretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill\nit was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and\nsubstantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said\nAdrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without\ninvoluntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,\nand vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I\nlove to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:\n\n"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has\nbeen our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like\nhonest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,\nhonored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who\nare so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your\nrecommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from\na position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To\nwrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but\na pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and\ndearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on\nreading:\n\n"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us\nto implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked\nto think only of one\'s self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place\nupon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were\nconducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still\nremains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,\nand, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He\nis a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he\nappears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a\nlittle to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his\ncountrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of\nan ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened\nall my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of\nthe Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne\'s three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they\nwere accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her\npretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,\nas if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and\nrecollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully\ninterested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had\ncalled him, continued to read Dupont\'s letter:\n\n"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to\nattend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has\nlost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to\nParis, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very\ngreatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have\nobtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud\nto proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,\nconfidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young\ncompatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his\nfather, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by\nthe English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These\ncircumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one\nof our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that\nGeneral Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his\nservice."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,\n"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things\nhappen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon\ncreature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in\ntruth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy\nDupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we\nshould have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our\nown griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave\nand estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust\nto me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only\nnecessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of\ncountenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy\nof the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the\npurchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian\nvestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent\nhither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have\nworn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful\nhats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is\nnot a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what\ncan either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome\nyoung prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and\ncashmere.Most assuredly I\'ll not miss this rare and unique opportunity\nof exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the\nname--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is\nthis!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he\nmerits!"And then she read on:\n\n"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give\nhim, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer\na very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so\nunfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would\nperhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without\nbeing known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be\npleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the\ncontrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it\nhas been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja\nsing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her\nrecollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names\nthat my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing\nmore chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by\nmarriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that\ncharacter.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are\nnot so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or\nconfound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid\nEuropean dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty\nfairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our\ndismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him\nof his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of\nher women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The\nyoung girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials\nfor writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I\nawait orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the\ngayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to\na meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of\ndrawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in\nall others:\n\n"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,\nwith that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever\ndistinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who\ndesigned my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present\naffair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,\nsir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy\nthat you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,\nfrom the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and\ncorrectness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will\nchoose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all\nthings, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you\nwill add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere\nshawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits\nbrown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you\nwill depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you\nknow so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,\nwill there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you\nwill tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another\nquarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown\nfriend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is\nnecessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will\nadd, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures\nhim to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you\nwill tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will\ncause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he\nfinds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the\nunknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,\nmodestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at\nthe opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though\nthis must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey\nas rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de\nBabylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of\nBABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an\nOriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so\nhappy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to\nbe at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in\nextravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you\nin this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is\nbecause it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,\nthere is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and\ndignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly\nresumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient\ndays, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me\ndraw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of\nbattle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to\nmy dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed\nme, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere\nprincess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to\nunderstand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of\nthis running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is\nproper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that\nhe is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine\nexpression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves\n(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble\ngenerosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,\nthat I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that\nGeorgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an\norder upon her banker, which was expressed thus:\n\n"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may\nrequire for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had\ncontinued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress\'s\ntoilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in\norder to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and\nimmovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne\'s\ndictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been\nseen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her\nmemory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the\ndoor of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to\nexecute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine\nprecipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her\nleaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:\n\n"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go\nto the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,\nseal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the\nletter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky\nyesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and\nhe appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the\nlittle reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected\nher, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep\nblue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with\ninterlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her\nnymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,\nfastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a\nnecklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair\ncountenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral\ntresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him\nbelieve that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been\nobliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse\nthough, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell\nover upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his\nwell polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a\ncap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,\nembroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young\nblacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful\nfolds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and\nbecame him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have\ndone.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a\nmagnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same\nmetal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased\nby JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only\nseparated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not\nperceived the young lady\'s entrance.He started, and turned quickly\nround, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a\nbeautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de\nCardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an\nartist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the\ntitle-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have\nhis name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order\nof a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at\nmy eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after\nhaving made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I\nordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the\ngoldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of\nthe rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation\nmore graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a\nlittle more at ease, answered:\n\n"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such\na proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but\nfelicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple\nsilk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of\nthe same materials.Seeing Agricola\'s hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with\nembarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to\nhim gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,\nwill always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,\nsir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what\ngood presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure\nof being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in\nthe employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you\noffered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of\nyou perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the\ngreatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at\nease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if\nyou knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to\nme, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite\nof my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is\nthat is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,\nwho in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to\nbring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had\npicked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the\nhappiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am\ndragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself\nfor her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don\'t know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment\'s silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised\nair; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very\nindustrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is\ndeformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,\non the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the\nother, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain\nthat your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own\nthought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had\npresented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this\ncomparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could\nsay to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel\nmisfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,\nwhen we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we\nare rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will\nquickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was\nalways observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises\nfrom independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness\nof sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his\nprotectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate\nand kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and\nstriking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who\ninspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I\nshould not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory\nsuspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one\nanother; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our\nexcellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves\nare far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by\nassisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my\nmother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is\nnot only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,\nwhom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from\nSiberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to\nhis former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much\nsurprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his\ndaughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more\nastonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so\nsweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one\nanother.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having\nbeen confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths\nof Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget\nso many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of\na lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;\nthat which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my\nlabor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;\nbut that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent\nby some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been\nreceived by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with\nsurprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,\nwhen I return to my mother after a day\'s toil, and often, even while\nforging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse\nmyself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,\nis, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune\nto be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of\nhis workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the\nreverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass\nof the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest\nclaim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of\nconspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned\non very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will\nbecome of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to\nregard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal\nSimon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk\nof being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety\nfor me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for\nthe prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor\nwill suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself\nquite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in\nthe midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of\nall, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately\nconnected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"\nsaid she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor\nexercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has\nalways had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his\nhealth; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day\non which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly\nat ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some\nother means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for\nthe repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever\nbe grateful."It is proper that those\nwho have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who\nhave too little.Marshal Simon\'s daughters are members of my family, and\nthey will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will\napprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to\nthank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,\nI shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room\nfrom an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,\nexclaiming:\n\n"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said\nGeorgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the\nwalls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,\nas if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:\nand now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and\nare on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been\nacquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for\nMarshal Simon\'s daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything\nthe least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to\nbe voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But\nin any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and\nescape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my\nmeasures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep\npossession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man\nknocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse\nhas not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named\nAgricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great\nimportance.""That\'s my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a\ntrick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for\ntrick.added she, addressing herself to\nHebe."I answered, that I didn\'t know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is\nnecessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am\nunfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my\naunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is\nrendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the\ndaughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,\nyou will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to\naccept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the\npower of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come\nin; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I\nam no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her\nfears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves\nyou as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget\nthem also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your\nfamily.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by\ngiving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these\nannoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will\ncome and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a\nnobleman\'s left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,\n"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of\nconcealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all\nsearches.You will be very well\naccommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the\nplace inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your\nposition do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not\nowe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he\nhas bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you\nforget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you\nhave restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this\nsingular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are\nentirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother\'s, in\nthis pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if\nyou do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe\nbrought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for\nAdrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the\nPrincess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the\napartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,\nputting a paper into the duenna\'s hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o\'clock.""But before nine o\'clock she came home, after having passed the night out\nof her house.Eight o\'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do\nnot understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o\'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in\norder to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I\nknow nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your\ncompanions.They don\'t distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested\npermission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing\ndown all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn\'t you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew\nthe contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending\noff this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I\nhave been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very\ngreat mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:\n\n"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are\nfree."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and\nwith tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who\nplaced me here.""In spite of one\'s self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so\nconfiding."But you are not here to sing her\npraises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early\nthis morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview\nwhich she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of\nwhat she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,\nwithout Florine being able to hear her: "\'They laugh most who laugh\nlast.\'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would\ntremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I\nadvise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do\nyou a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer\nhouse, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.There has appeared, however, a new claimant for the\nplace--one that possesses all the qualities that go to make a social\nfavorite, and has the additional advantages of greater ease of\nexecution, and wider possibilities of adaptation.This is the BOSTON--not, as many persons suppose, a new creation nor\nindeed is it a novelty even to the American public, for it was\nintroduced here more than a generation ago; but the great popularity of\nthe Two-Step, which had just then come into vogue, and was fast gaining\nfavor under the influence of such brilliant compositions as the\nquick-step marches by Sousa, operated against its immediate acceptance.One of the reasons why the Boston should prove today a more attractive\ndance than any other, is the fact that now there are more captivating\nairs written for this particular form of dance than for any other, and\nas the Two-Step, in its time, found its most powerful ally in the music\nto which it was adapted, the Boston has today the persuasive\nintercession of such languorous and haunting melodies as "Love\'s\nAwakening" and "On the Wings of Dream," by Danglas; Sinibaldi\'s\n"Thrill," and others.General taste has gradually found out the superior charm of the Boston;\nthe pendulum of public favor has again swung in the direction of skilful\ndancing.The recent revival of the Waltz in its proper form, has brought with it\na larger appreciation of the more worthy and graceful social dances,\nand the entire world now recognizes the wonderful beauty of the Boston,\nand has welcomed it as a real competitor.The Boston is not a Waltz, yet it is the perfection of it.It is one of\nthose paradoxical things which, while it is impossible to be classified,\ncontains all that is to be found in almost any other dance.Even the\npersons who have so long and so loyally clung to other forms of dancing,\nand have abated none in their zeal for their favorites, have been\nunconsciously, and perhaps unwillingly, charmed by the seductiveness of\nthe Boston, until they now freely declare the new dance to be the\nsuperior of the Waltz.Therefore it is safe to say that the Boston will,\neventually, supersede the Waltz altogether.We demand a dance which combines ease of execution with attractive\nmovement.That is just what the Boston does, and perhaps more.It is so\nsimple in construction that, when acquired, it becomes natural, and its\nperfect adaptability assures it lasting popularity.Owing to the urgent request of many of his pupils and colleagues, the\nauthor has undertaken this little book in the hope that it will meet the\nrequirements of both teachers and students, and help to assure the\nproper appreciation of what is in reality the most delightful and\nartistic social dance since the Minuet.THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL POSITIONS\n\nIn order that the reader may the more readily understand the\ndescriptions given in this book, we will explain the five fundamental\npositions upon which the art of dancing rests.In the 1st position, the feet are together, heel against heel.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 2nd position, the heels are separated sidewise, and on the same\nline.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 3rd position, the heel of one foot touches the middle of the\nother.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 4th position, the feet are separated as in walking, either\ndirectly forward or directly backward.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 5th position, the heel of one foot touches the point of the\nother.[Illustration]\n\nIn all these positions the feet must be turned outward to form not less\nthan a right angle.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTNERS\n\nMuch, if not all, of the adverse criticism of the Boston which has been\noffered by educators, parents and other responsible objectors, has been\ndirected at the relative positions of the partners.This is, in fact, no\nmore than the general rule as regards the Social Round Dance, with the\npossible exception that the positions have been sometimes distorted by\nattempts to copy the freer forms of dancing that have been presented\nupon the stage.The Round Dance demands that a certain fixed grouping of the partners be\nmaintained in order that the rotation around a common moving centre may\nbe accomplished, and it is here that the most serious problem is to be\nfound.The dancing profession long ago undertook to settle upon arbitrary\ngroupings satisfactory to the needs of the dancers, and conforming to\nall the requirements of propriety and hygienic exercise.[Illustration]\n\nActing upon this basis, the reputable teachers of dancing throughout the\nworld have adopted and promulgated three fundamental groupings for the\nRound Dance which are so constructed as to provide the greatest ease of\nexecution and freedom of action.They are known as the Waltz Position,\nthe Open Position, and the Side Position of the Waltz.All round dances\nare executed in one or another of these groupings, which are not only\naccepted by all good teachers, but, with the exception of certain minor\nand unimportant variations, rigidly adhered to in all their work.In the Waltz Position the partners stand facing one another, with\nshoulders parallel, and looking over one another\'s right shoulder.Special attention must be paid to the parallel position of the\nshoulders, in order to fit the individual movements of the partners\nalong the line of direction.The gentleman places his right hand lightly upon the lady\'s back, at a\npoint about half-way across, between the waist-line and the\nshoulder-blades.The fingers are so rounded as to permit the free\ncirculation of air between the palm of the hand and the lady\'s back, and\nshould not be spread.The lady places her left hand lightly upon the gentleman\'s arm, allowing\nher fore-arm to rest gently upon his arm.The partners stand at an easy\ndistance from one another, inclining toward the common centre very\nslightly.The free hands are lightly joined at the side.This is merely\nto provide occupation for the disengaged arms, and the gentleman holds\nthe tip of the lady\'s hand lightly in the bended fingers of his own.Guiding is accomplished by the gentleman through a slight lifting of his\nright elbow.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE OPEN POSITION\n\nThe Open Position needs no explanation, and can be readily understood\nfrom the illustration facing page 8.THE SIDE POSITION OF THE WALTZ\n\nThe side position of the Waltz differs from the Waltz Position only in\nthe fact that the partners stand side by side and with the engaged arms\nmore widely extended.The free arms are held as in the frontispiece.In\nthe actual rotation this position naturally resolves itself into the\nregular Waltz Position.THE STEP OF THE BOSTON\n\nThe preparatory step of the Boston differs materially from that of any\nother Social Dance.There is _only one position_ of the feet in the\nBoston--the 4th.That is to say, the feet are separated one from the\nother as in walking.On the first count of the measure the whole leg swings freely, and as a\nunit, from the hip, and the foot is put down practically flat upon the\nfloor, where it immediately receives the entire weight of the body\n_perpendicularly_.The weight is held entirely upon this foot during the\nremainder of the measure, whether it be in 3/4 or 2/4 time.The following preparatory exercises must be practiced forward and\nbackward until the movements become natural, before proceeding.In going backward, the foot must be carried to the rear as far as\npossible, and the weight must always be perpendicular to the supporting\nfoot.These movements are identical with walking, and except the particular\ncare which must be bestowed upon the placing of the foot on the first\ncount of the measure, they require no special degree of attention.On the second count the free leg swings forward until the knee has\nbecome entirely straightened, and is held, suspended, during the third\ncount of the measure.This should be practiced, first with the weight\nresting upon the entire sole of the supporting foot, and then, when this\nhas been perfectly accomplished, the same exercise may be supplemented\nby raising the heel (of the supporting foot) on the second count and\nlowering it on the third count._Great care must be taken not to divide\nthe weight._\n\nFor the purpose of instruction, it is well to practice these steps to\nMazurka music, because of the clearness of the count.[Illustration]\n\nWhen the foregoing exercises have been so fully mastered as to become,\nin a sense, muscular habits, we may, with safety, add the next feature.This consists in touching the floor with the point of the free foot, at\na point as far forward or backward as can be done without dividing the\nweight, on the second count of the measure.Thus, we have accomplished,\nas it were, an interrupted, or, at least, an arrested step, and this is\nthe true essence of the Boston.Too great care cannot be expended upon this phase of the step, and it\nmust be practiced over and over again, both forward and backward, until\nthe movement has become second nature.All this must precede any attempt\nto turn.The turning of the Boston is simplicity itself, but it is, nevertheless,\nthe one point in the instruction which is most bothersome to\nlearners.The turn is executed upon the ball of _the supporting foot_,\nand consists in twisting half round without lifting either foot from the\nground.In this, the weight is held altogether upon the supporting foot,\nand there is no crossing.In carrying the foot forward for the second movement, the knees must\npass close to one another, and care must be taken that _the entire half\nturn comes upon the last count of the measure_.To sum up:--\n\nStarting with the weight upon the left foot, step forward, placing the\nentire weight upon the right foot, as in the illustration facing page 14\n(count 1); swing left leg quickly forward, straightening the left knee\nand raising the right heel, and touch the floor with the extended left\nfoot as in the illustration facing page 16, but without placing any\nweight upon that foot (count 2); execute a half-turn to the left,\nbackward, upon the ball of the supporting (right) foot, at the same time\nlowering the right heel, and finish as in the illustration opposite page\n18 (count 3).[Illustration]\n\nStarting again, this time with the weight wholly upon the right foot,\nand with the left leg extended backward, and the point of the left foot\nlightly touching the floor, step backward, throwing the weight entirely\nupon the left foot which sinks to a position flat upon the floor, as\nshown in the illustration facing page 21, (count 4); carry the right\nfoot quickly backward, and touch with the point as far back as possible\nupon the line of direction without dividing the weight, at the same time\nraising the left heel as in the illustration facing page 22, (count 5);\nand complete the rotation by executing a half-turn to the right,\nforward, upon the ball of the left foot, simultaneously lowering the\nleft heel, and finishing as in the illustration facing page 24, (count\n6).THE REVERSE\n\nThe reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the\nrotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to\nalternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the\nturning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of\nalternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see\npreparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the\ngentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole\nturn.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the\nturn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,\nand in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,\nthan that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure\nto reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised\nuntil one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The\nwriter has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only\nhelpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in\nobviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent\nunpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]\n\nAfter acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to\nMazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of\nSpanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more\nliquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of\nDanglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is\nalways opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,\nthe weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the\nweight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the\ndancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be\nheld back, instead of inclining slightly forward as in the other round\ndances.This seeming contradiction of forces lends to the Boston a\nunique charm which is to be found in no other dance.As the dancer becomes more familiar with the Boston, the movement\nbecomes so natural that little or no thought need be paid to technique,\nin order to develop the peculiar grace of it.The fact of its being a dance altogether in one position calls for\ngreater skill in the execution of the Boston, than would be the case if\nthere were other changes and contrasts possible, just as it is more\ndifficult to play a melody upon a violin of only one string.The Boston, in its completed form, resolves itself into a sort of\nwalking movement, so natural and easy that it may be enjoyed for a\nwhole evening without more fatigue than would be the result of a single\nhour of the Waltz and Two-Step.Aside from the attractiveness of the Boston as a social dance, its\nphysical benefits are more positive than those of any other Round Dance\nthat we have ever had.The action is so adjusted as to provide the\nmaximum of muscular exercise and the minimum of physical effort.This\ntends towards the conservation of energy, and produces and maintains, at\nthe same time an evenness of blood pressure and circulation.The\nmovements also necessitate a constant exercise of the ankles and insteps\nwhich is very strengthening to those parts, and cannot fail to raise and\nsupport the arch of the foot.Taken from any standpoint, the Boston is one of the most worthy forms of\nthe social dance ever devised, and the distortions of position which\nare now occasionally practiced must soon give way to the genuinely\nrefining influence of the action.[Illustration]\n\nOf the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond\nthe description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated\nin the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete\nunderstanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further\nthe proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady\'s\npart.The gentleman\'s is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._\n\n\nTHE LONG BOSTON\n\nThe ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is\ncommonly known as the "Long" Boston to distinguish it from other forms\nand variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and\nat any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it\nshould be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE SHORT BOSTON\n\nThe "Short" Boston differs from the "Long" Boston only in measure.It is\ndanced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)\noccupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements\neach occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between\nthe "Long" and the "Short" Boston the same difference as between the\nWaltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the "Short" Boston, the\nrising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take\nthe form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less\nfatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON\n\nThe "Open" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first\npart is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages\n8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the "Long"\nBoston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,\nwithout turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to\nface directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the\nposition shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one\nBoston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz\nPosition for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE BOSTON DIP\n\nThe "Dip" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4\nmeasures of the "Long" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:\n\nStanding upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the\nweight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in\nfront of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);\nlower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original\nplace where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across\nin front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the\nleft heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side\nof the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across\nin front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down\nthe left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it\n(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and\nfinish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives\nthe weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the\nmovement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly\ncoincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TURKEY TROT\n\n_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._\n\n\nDuring the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning\n(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,\nstretch the free foot backward, (lady\'s left, gentleman\'s right) as\nshown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady\'s right, gentleman\'s left)\nswaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and\npointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *\n\n  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in "The Gobbler" by\n  J. Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE\n\n\nThe "Aeroplane Glide" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed\nto represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its\nname from that fact.The sole difference between the "Dip" and "Aeroplane" consists in the\nsix running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running\nsteps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before\nand behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure\nrequires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is\nnoticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the "Dip".[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TANGO\n\n\nThe Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the\npeculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends\nlargely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the\nmusic as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,\nand the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend\nthemselves most readily to verbal description.1\n\nThe partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes\nthe lady\'s right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full\nextent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand\nupon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration\nopposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and\nsteps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows\nforward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing\none foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same\ndirection.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the\nwhole is repeated at will.[Illustration]\n\n\nTANGO No.2\n\nThis variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman\ntakes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two\nsteps to the side (the lady\'s right and the gentleman\'s left) and two\nsteps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as\nthe feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the\nwhole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE

BOSTON MUSIC COMPANY 26 & 28 WEST ST., BOSTON, MASS.TRANSCRIBER\'S NOTES:\n\n\n  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.It may be here mentioned that one of the greatest lovers and breeders\nof heavy horses during the nineteenth century was schooled on the Duke\nof Hamilton’s estate, and he was eminently successful in blending the\nShire and Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and sires which\nhave done much towards building up the modern Clydesdale.Lawrence Drew, of Merryton, who, like Mr.Robert Bakewell,\nhad the distinction of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince of Wales)\nbefore Royalty.Drew) bought many Shires in the Midland\nCounties of England.So keen was his judgment that he would “spot a\nwinner” from a railway carriage, and has been known to alight at the\nnext station and make the journey back to the farm where he saw the\nlikely animal.On at least one occasion the farmer would not sell the best by itself,\nso the enthusiast bought the whole team, which he had seen at plough\nfrom the carriage window on the railway.Quite the most celebrated Shire stallion purchased by Mr.Drew in\nEngland was Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession in 1878.This horse won several prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and he\nalso begot Lincolnshire Lad II.1365, the sire of Harold 3703, Champion\nof the London Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby Harold (Champion\nin London as a yearling, a three-year-old and a four-year-old),\nMarkeaton Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of Queen of the\nShires, the Champion mare of the same year, 1897, and numerous other\ncelebrities.Drew in Derbyshire, was Flora,\nby Lincolnshire Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a great winner, and\nthe dam of Prince of Clay, Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all\nof which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters of the first rank.There is evidence to show that heavy horses from other countries than\nFlanders were imported, but this much is perfectly clear, that the\nFlemish breed was selected to impart size, therefore, if we give honour\nwhere it is due, these “big and handsome” black stallions that we read\nof deserve credit for helping to build up the breed of draught horses\nin Britain, which is universally known as the Shire, its distinguishing\nfeature being that it is the heaviest breed in existence.CHAPTER X\n\nFACTS AND FIGURES\n\n\nThe London Show of 1890 was a remarkable one in more than one sense.The entries totalled 646 against 447 the previous year.This led to the\nadoption of measures to prevent exhibitors from making more than two\nentries in one class.The year 1889 holds the record, so far, for the\nnumber of export certificates granted by the Shire Horse Society, the\ntotal being 1264 against 346 in 1913, yet Shires were much dearer in\nthe latter year than in the former.Twenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old stallions shown in\nLondon was 161, while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the rule of\ncharging double fees for more than two entries from one exhibitor.Another innovation was the passing of a rule that every animal entered\nfor show should be passed by a veterinary surgeon, this being the form\nof certificate drawn up:--\n\n    “I hereby certify that ________ entered by Mr.________ for\n    exhibition at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show, 1891,\n    has been examined by me and, in my opinion, is free from the\n    following hereditary diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling),\n    Ringbone, Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin, Cataract,\n    Sidebone, Shivering.”\n\nThese alterations led to a smaller show in 1891 (which was the first at\nwhich the writer had the honour of leading round a candidate, exhibited\nby a gentleman who subsequently bred several London winners, and who\nserved on the Council of the Shire Horse Society).But to hark back to\nthe 1890 Show.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s\n(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the\nSort the Second, made £1000 at the show after winning third prize; the\nsecond-prize colt in the same class being sold for £700.The Champion mare was Starlight, then owned by Mr.R. N.\nSutton-Nelthorpe, but sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,\nfor 925 guineas to Mr.Fred Crisp--who held a prominent place in the\nShire Horse world for several years.Starlight rewarded him by winning\nChampion prize both in 1891 and 1892, her three successive victories\nbeing a record in championships for females at the London Show.Others\nhave won highest honours thrice, but, so far, not in successive years.In 1890 the number of members of the Shire Horse Society was 1615, the\namount given in prizes being just over £700.A curious thing about that\n1890 meeting, with its great entry, was that it resulted in a loss of\n£1300 to the Society, but in those days farmers did not attend in their\nthousands as they do now.The sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the number of members being 4200, and\nthe entries totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at the time\nthis is being written, for distribution at the Shire Horse Show of\n1915, which will be held when this country has, with the help of her\nAllies, waged a great war for seven months, yet before it had been\ncarried on for seven days show committees in various parts of the\ncountry cancelled their shows, being evidently under the impression\nthat “all was in the dust.” With horses of all grades at a premium, any\nmethod of directing the attention of farmers and breeders generally\nto the scarcity that is certain to exist is justifiable, particularly\nthat which provides for over two thousand pounds being spent among\nmembers of what is admitted to be the most flourishing breed society in\nexistence.At the London Show of 1895 two classes for geldings were added to\nthe prize schedule, making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two\ngeldings the total was only 489, so that it was a small show, its most\nnotable feature being that Mr.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha won\nthe Challenge Cup for mares and died later.Up till the Show of 1898 both stallions and mares commenced with the\neldest, so that Class I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,\nthe yearlings coming last, the mare classes following in like order.But for the 1898 Show a desirable change was made by putting the\nyearlings first, and following on with classes in the order of age.At\nthis show, 1898, Sir Alexander Henderson performed the unique feat of\nwinning not only the male and female Challenge Cups, but also the other\ntwo, so that he had four cup winners, three of them being sire, dam,\nand son, viz.Markeaton Royal Harold, Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this\nmade the victory particularly noteworthy.The last named also succeeded\nin winning champion honours in 1899 and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight.The cup-winning gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had won similar honours\nthe previous year for Mr.W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.He possessed both weight and quality, and it is doubtful\nif a better gelding has been exhibited since.He was also cup winner\nagain in 1899, consequently he holds the record for geldings at the\nLondon Show.It should have been mentioned that the system of giving breeders prizes\nwas introduced at the Show of 1896, the first prizes being reduced\nfrom £25 to £20 in the case of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those\nfor mares, to allow the breeder of the first prize animal £10 in each\nbreeding class, and the breeder of each second-prize stallion or mare\n£5, the latter sum being awarded to breeders of first-prize geldings.This was a move in the right direction, and certainly gave the Shire\nHorse Society and its London Show a lift up in the eyes of farmers\nwho had bred Shires but had not exhibited.Since then they have never\nlost their claim on any good animal they have bred, that is why they\nflock to the Show in February from all parts of England, and follow the\njudging with such keen interest; there is money in it.This Show of 1896 was, therefore, one of the most important ever held.It marked the beginning of a more democratic era in the history of the\nGreat Horse.The sum of £1142 was well spent.By the year 1900 the prize money had reached a total of £1322, the\nclasses remaining as from 1895 with seven for stallions, six for\nmares, and two for geldings.The next year, 1901, another class, for\nmares 16 hands 2 inches and over, was added, and also another class\nfor geldings, resulting in a further rise to £1537 in prize money.The sensation of this Show was the winning of the Championship by new\ntenant-farmer exhibitors, Messrs.J. and M. Walwyn, with an unknown\ntwo-year-old colt, Bearwardcote Blaze.This was a bigger surprise than\nthe success of Rokeby Harold as a yearling in 1893, as he had won\nprizes for his breeder, Mr.A. C. Rogers, and for Mr.John Parnell\n(at Ashbourne) before getting into Lord Belper’s possession, therefore\ngreat things were expected of him, whereas the colt Bearwardcote Blaze\nwas a veritable “dark horse.” Captain Heaton, of Worsley, was one of\nthe judges, and subsequently purchased him for Lord Ellesmere.The winning of the Championship by a yearling colt was much commented\non at the time (1893), but he was altogether an extraordinary colt.The\ncritics of that day regarded him as the best yearling Shire ever seen.Said one, “We breed Shire horses every day, but a colt like this comes\nonly once in a lifetime.” Fortunately I saw him both in London and at\nthe Chester Royal, where he was also Champion, my interest being all\nthe greater because he was bred in Bucks, close to where I “sung my\nfirst song.”\n\nOf two-year-old champions there have been at least four, viz.Prince\nWilliam, in 1885; Buscot Harold, 1898; Bearwardcote Blaze, 1901; and\nChampion’s Goalkeeper, 1913.Three-year-olds have also won supreme honours fairly often.Those\nwithin the writer’s recollection being Bury Victor Chief, in 1892,\nafter being first in his class for the two previous years, and reserve\nchampion in 1891; Rokeby Harold in 1895, who was Champion in 1893,\nand cup winner in 1894; Buscot Harold, in 1899, thus repeating his\ntwo-year-old performance; Halstead Royal Duke in 1909, the Royal\nChampion as a two-year-old.The 1909 Show was remarkable for the successes of Lord Rothschild, who\nafter winning one of the championships for the previous six years, now\ntook both of the Challenge Cups, the reserve championship, and the Cup\nfor the best old stallion.The next and last three-year-old to win was, or is, the renowned\nChampion’s Goalkeeper, who took the Challenge Cup in 1914 for the\nsecond time.When comparing the ages of the male and female champions of the London\nShow, it is seen that while the former often reach the pinnacle of\nfame in their youth, the latter rarely do till they have had time to\ndevelop.CHAPTER XI\n\nHIGH PRICES\n\n\nIt is not possible to give particulars of sums paid for many animals\nsold privately, as the amount is often kept secret, but a few may be\nmentioned.The first purchase to attract great attention was that of\nPrince William, by the late Lord Wantage from Mr.John Rowell in 1885\nfor £1500, or guineas, although Sir Walter Gilbey had before that given\na real good price to Mr.W. R. Rowland for the Bucks-bred Spark.The\nnext sensational private sale was that of Bury Victor Chief, the Royal\nChampion of 1891, to Mr.Joseph Wainwright, the seller again being\nMr.John Rowell and the price 2500 guineas.In that same year, 1891,\nChancellor, one of Premier’s noted sons, made 1100 guineas at Mr.A.\nC. Duncombe’s sale at Calwich, when eighteen of Premier’s sons and\ndaughters were paraded with their sire, and made an average, including\nfoals, of £273 each.In 1892 a record in letting was set up by the Welshpool Shire Horse\nSociety, who gave Lord Ellesmere £1000 for the use of Vulcan (the\nchampion of the 1891 London Show) to serve 100 mares.This society\nwas said to be composed of “shrewd tenant farmers who expected a good\nreturn for their money.” Since then a thousand pounds for a first-class\nsire has been paid many times, and it is in districts where they have\nbeen used that those in search of the best go for their foals.Two\nnotable instances can be mentioned, viz.Champion’s Goalkeeper and\nLorna Doone, the male and female champions of the London Show of 1914,\nwhich were both bred in the Welshpool district.Other high-priced\nstallions to be sold by auction in the nineties were Marmion to Mr.Arkwright in 1892 for 1400 guineas, Waresley\nPremier Duke to Mr.Victor Cavendish (now the Duke of Devonshire) for\n1100 guineas at Mr.W. H. O. Duncombe’s sale in 1897, and a similar sum\nby the same buyer for Lord Llangattock’s Hendre Crown Prince in the\nsame year.For the next really high-priced stallion we must come to the dispersion\nof the late Lord Egerton’s stud in April, 1909, when Messrs.W. and H.\nWhitley purchased the five-year-old Tatton Dray King (London Champion\nin 1908) for 3700 guineas, to join their celebrated Devonshire stud.At this sale Tatton Herald, a two-year-old colt, made 1200 guineas to\nMessrs.Ainscough, who won the championship with him at the Liverpool\nRoyal in 1910, but at the Royal Show of 1914 he figured, and won, as a\ngelding.As a general rule, however, these costly sires have proved well worth\ntheir money.As mentioned previously, the year 1913 will be remembered by the\nfact that 4100 guineas was given at Lord Rothschild’s sale for the\ntwo-year-old Shire colt Champion’s Goalkeeper, by Childwick Champion,\nwho, like Tatton Dray King and others, is likely to prove a good\ninvestment at his cost.Twice since then he has championed the London\nShow, and by the time these lines are read he may have accomplished\nthat great feat for the third time, his age being four years old in\n1915.Of mares, Starlight, previously mentioned, was the first to approach a\nthousand pounds in an auction sale.At the Shire Horse Show of 1893 the late Mr.Philo Mills exhibited\nMoonlight, a mare which he had purchased privately for £1000, but she\nonly succeeded in getting a commended card, so good was the company in\nwhich she found herself.The first Shire mare to make over a thousand\nguineas at a stud sale was Dunsmore Gloaming, by Harold.This was at\nthe second Dunsmore Sale early in 1894, the price being 1010 guineas,\nand the purchaser Mr.W. J. Buckley, Penyfai, Carmarthen, from whom\nshe was repurchased by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz, and was again\nincluded in the Dunsmore catalogue of January 27, 1898, when she\nrealized 780 guineas, Sir J. Blundell Maple being the lucky purchaser,\nthe word being used because she won the challenge cup in London, both\nin 1899 and 1900.Foaled in 1890 at Sandringham, by Harold (London\nChampion), dam by Staunton Hero (London Champion), she was sold at\nKing Edward’s first sale in 1892 for 200 guineas.As a three- and\na four-year-old she was second in London, and she also won second\nprize as a seven-year-old for Sir P. A. Muntz, finally winning supreme\nhonours at nine and ten years of age, a very successful finish to a\ndistinguished career.On February 11th, 1898, another record was set by\nHis Majesty King Edward VII., whose three-year-old filly Sea Breeze, by\nthe same sire as Bearwardcote Blaze, made 1150 guineas, Sir J. Blundell\nMaple again being the buyer.The next mare to make four figures at a\nstud sale was Hendre Crown Princess at the Lockinge sale of February\n14, 1900, the successful bidder being Mr.H. H. Smith-Carington,\nAshby Folville, Melton Mowbray, who has bought and bred many good\nShires.This date, February 14, seems to\nbe a particularly lucky one for Shire sales, for besides the one just\nmentioned Lord Rothschild has held at least two sales on February 14.In 1908 the yearling colt King Cole VII.was bought by the late Lord\nWinterstoke for 900 guineas, the highest price realized by the stud\nsales of that year.Then there is the record sale at Tring Park on\nFebruary 14, 1913, when one stallion, Champions Goalkeeper, made 4100\nguineas, and another, Blacklands Kingmaker, 1750.The honour for being the highest priced Shire mare sold at a stud sale\nbelongs to the great show mare, Pailton Sorais, for which Sir Arthur\nNicholson gave 1200 guineas at the dispersion sale of Mr.Max Michaelis\nat Tandridge, Surrey, on October 26, 1911.It will be remembered by\nShire breeders that she made a successful appearance in London each\nyear from one to eight years old, her list being: First, as a yearling;\nsixth, as a two-year-old; second, as a three-year-old; first and\nreserve champion at four years old, five and seven; first in her class\nat six.She was not to be denied the absolute championship, however,\nand it fell to her in 1911.No Shire in history has achieved greater\ndistinction than this, not even Honest Tom 1105, who won first prize\nat the Royal Show six years in succession, as the competition in those\nfar-off days was much less keen than that which Pailton Sorais had to\nface, and it should be mentioned that she was also a good breeder,\nthe foal by her side when she was sold made 310 guineas and another\ndaughter 400 guineas.Such are the kind of Shire mares that farmers want.Those that will\nwork, win, and breed.As we have seen in this incomplete review, Aurea\nwon the championship of the London show, together with her son.Belle\nCole, the champion mare of 1908, bred a colt which realized 900 guineas\nas a yearling a few days before she herself gained her victory, a clear\nproof that showing and breeding are not incompatible.CHAPTER XII\n\nA FEW RECORDS\n\n\nThe highest priced Shires sold by auction have already been given.So a\nfew of the most notable sales may be mentioned, together with the dates\nthey were held--\n\n                                                     £   _s._ _d._\n    Tring Park (draft), February 14,

28, 1911:\n                               84 Shires averaged   188  17    6\n\nThese ten are worthy of special mention, although there are several\nwhich come close up to the £200 average.That given first is the most\nnoteworthy for the reason that Lord Rothschild only sold a portion of\nhis stud, whereas the executors of the late Lord Egerton of Tatton\nsold their whole lot of twenty-one head, hence the higher average.Two clear records were, however, set up at the historical Tring Park\nsale in 1913, viz.the highest individual price for a stallion and the\nhighest average price for animals by one sire, seven sons and daughters\nof Childwick Champion, making no less than £927 each, including two\nyearling colts.The best average of the nineteenth century was that made at its close\nby the late Lord Llangattock, who had given a very high price privately\nfor Prince Harold, by Harold, which, like his sire, was a very\nsuccessful stock horse, his progeny making a splendid average at this\ncelebrated sale.A spirited bidder at all of the important sales and a\nvery successful exhibitor, Lord Llangattock did not succeed in winning\neither of the London Championships.One private sale during 1900 is worth mentioning, which was that of Mr.James Eadie’s two cup-winning geldings, Bardon Extraordinary and Barrow\nFarmer for 225 guineas each, a price which has only been equalled once\nto the writer’s knowledge.This was in the autumn of 1910, when Messrs.Truman gave 225 guineas for a gelding, at Messrs.Manley’s Repository,\nCrewe, this specimen of the English lorry horse being bought for export\nto the United States.In 1894 the late Lord Wantage held a sale which possessed unique\nfeatures in that fifty animals catalogued were all sired by the dual\nLondon Champion and Windsor Royal (Jubilee Show) Gold Medal Winner,\nPrince William, to whom reference has already been made.As a great supporter of the old English breed, Lord\nWantage, K.C.B., a Crimean veteran, deserves to be bracketed with the\nrecently deceased Sir Walter Gilbey, inasmuch as that in 1890 he gave\nthe Lockinge Cup for the best Shire mare exhibited at the London show,\nwhich Starlight succeeded in winning outright for Mr.Sir Walter Gilbey gave the Elsenham Cup for the best stallion, value\n100 guineas, in 1884, which, however, was not won permanently till the\nlate Earl of Ellesmere gained his second championship with Vulcan in\n1891.Since these dates the Shire Horse Society has continued to give\nthe Challenge Cups both for the best stallion and mare.The sales hitherto mentioned have been those of landowners, but it must\nnot be supposed that tenant farmers have been unable to get Shires\nenough to call a home sale.A. H. Clark sold\nfifty-one Shires at Moulton Eaugate, the average being £127 5_s._, the\nstriking feature of this sale being the number of grey (Thumper) mares.F. W. Griffin, another very\nsuccessful farmer breeder in the Fens, held a joint sale at Postland,\nthe former’s average being £100 6_s._ 9_d._, and the latter’s £123\n9_s._ 8_d._, each selling twenty-five animals.The last home sale held by a farmer was that of Mr.Matthew Hubbard\nat Eaton, Grantham, on November 1, 1912, when an average of £73 was\nobtained for fifty-seven lots.Reference has already been made to Harold, Premier, and Prince William,\nas sires, but there have been others equally famous since the Shire\nHorse Society has been in existence.Among them may be mentioned Bar\nNone, who won at the 1882 London Show for the late Mr.James Forshaw,\nstood for service at his celebrated Carlton Stud Farm for a dozen\nseasons, and is credited with having sired over a thousand foals.They\nwere conspicuous for flat bone and silky feather, when round cannon\nbones and curly hair were much more common than they are to-day,\ntherefore both males and females by Bar None were highly prized; £2000\nwas refused for at least one of his sons, while a two-year-old daughter\nmade 800 guineas in 1891.For several years the two sires of Mr.A. C.\nDuncombe, at Calwich, Harold and Premier, sired many winners, and in\nthose days the Ashbourne Foal Show was worth a journey to see.In 1899 Sir P. Albert Muntz took first prize in London with a\nbig-limbed yearling, Dunsmore Jameson, who turned out to be the sire\nof strapping yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which carried all\nbefore them in the show ring for several years, and a three-year-old\nson made the highest price ever realized at any of the Dunsmore Sales,\nwhen the stud was dispersed in 1909.This was 1025 guineas given by\nLord Middleton for Dunsmore Jameson II.For four years in succession,\n1903 to 1906, Dunsmore Jameson sired the highest number of winners, not\nonly in London, but at all the principal shows.His service fee was\nfifteen guineas to “approved mares only,” a high figure for a horse\nwhich had only won at the Shire Horse Show as a yearling.Among others\nhe sired Dunsmore Raider, who in turn begot Dunsmore Chessie, Champion\nmare at the London Shows of 1912 and 1913.Jameson contained the blood\nof Lincolnshire Lad on both sides of his pedigree.By the 1907 show\nanother sire had come to the front, and his success was phenomenal;\nthis was Lockinge Forest King, bred by the late Lord Wantage in 1889,\npurchased by the late Mr.J. P. Cross, of Catthorpe Towers, Rugby, who\nwon first prize, and reserve for the junior cup with him in London as\na three-year-old, also first and champion at the (Carlisle) Royal\nShow the same year, 1902.It is worth while to study the breeding of\nLockinge Forest King._Sire_--Lockinge Manners._Great grand sire_--Harold._Great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad II._Great great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad 1196 (Drew’s).The dam of Lockinge Forest King was The Forest Queen (by Royal Albert,\n1885, a great sire in his day); she was first prize winner at the Royal\nShow, Nottingham, 1888, first and champion, Peterborough, 1888, first\nBath and West, 1887 and 1888, and numerous other prizes.Her dam traced\nback to (Dack’s) Matchless (1509), a horse which no less an authority\nthan the late Mr.James Forshaw described as “the sire of all time.”\n\nThis accounts for the marvellous success of Lockinge Forest King as a\nstud horse, although his success, unlike Jameson’s, came rather late in\nhis life of ten years.We have already seen that he\nhas sired the highest priced Shire mare publicly sold.At the Newcastle\nRoyal of 1908, both of the gold medal winners were by him, so were\nthe two champions at the 1909 Shire Horse Show.His most illustrious\nfamily was bred by a tenant farmer, Mr.John Bradley, Halstead, Tilton,\nLeicester.The eldest member is Halstead Royal Duke, the London\nChampion of 1909, Halstead Blue Blood, 3rd in London, 1910, both owned\nby Lord Rothschild, and Halstead Royal Duchess, who won the junior cup\nin London for her breeder in 1912.The dam of the trio is Halstead\nDuchess III by Menestrel, by Hitchin Conqueror (London Champion, 1890).Two other matrons deserve to be mentioned, as they will always shine in\nthe history of the Shire breed.One is Lockington Beauty by Champion\n457, who died at a good old age at Batsford Park, having produced\nPrince William, the champion referred to more than once in these pages,\nhis sire being William the Conqueror.Then Marmion II (by Harold),\nwho was first in London in 1891, and realized 1400 guineas at Mr.Also a daughter, Blue Ruin, which won at London Show\nof 1889 for Mr.R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe, but, unfortunately, died from\nfoaling in that year.Another famous son was Mars Victor, a horse of\ngreat size, and also a London winner, on more than one occasion.Freeman-Mitford (Lord\nRedesdale) in the year of his sire’s--Hitchin Conqueror’s--championship\nin 1890, for the sum of £1500.Blue Ruin was own sister to Prince William, but the other three were by\ndifferent sires.To look at--I saw her in 1890--Lockington Beauty was quite a common\nmare with obviously small knees, and none too much weight and width,\nher distinguishing feature being a mane of extraordinary length.The remaining dam to be mentioned as a great breeder is Nellie\nBlacklegs by Bestwick’s Prince, famous for having bred five sons--which\nwere all serving mares in the year 1891--and a daughter, all by\nPremier.The first was Northwood, a horse used long and successfully by\nLord Middleton and the sire of Birdsall Darling, the dam of Birdsall\nMenestrel, London champion of 1904.The second, Hydrometer, first\nin London in 1889, then sold to the late Duke of Marlborough, and\npurchased when his stud was dispersed in 1893 by the Warwick Shire\nHorse Society for 600 guineas.A.\nC. Duncombe’s sale in 1891 for 1100 guineas, a record in those days,\nto Mr.F. Crisp, who let him to the Peterborough Society in 1892 for\n£500.Calwich Topsman, another son, realized 500 guineas when sold, and\nSenator made 350.The daughter, rightly named “Sensible,” bred Mr.John\nSmith of Ellastone, Ashbourne, a colt foal by Harold in 1893, which\nturned out to be Markeaton Royal Harold, the champion stallion of 1897.This chapter was headed “A few records,” and surely this set up by\nPremier and Nellie Blacklegs is one.The record show of the Shire Horse Society, as regards the number of\nentries, was that of 1904, with a total of 862; the next for size was\nthe 1902 meeting when 860 were catalogued.Of course the smallest\nshow was the initial one of 1880, when 76 stallions and 34 mares made\na total of 110 entries.The highest figure yet made in the public\nauction sales held at the London Show is 1175 guineas given by Mr.R. Heath, Biddulph Grange, Staffs., in 1911 for Rickford Coming\nKing, a three-year-old bred by the late Lord Winterstoke, and sold by\nhis executors, after having won fourth in his class, although first\nand reserve for the junior cup as a two-year-old.He was sired by\nRavenspur, with which King Edward won first prize in London, 1906,\nhis price of 825 guineas to Lord Winterstoke at the Wolferton Sale\nof February 8, 1907, being the highest at any sale of that year.The\nlesson to be learned is that if you want to create a record with Shires\nyou must begin and continue with well-bred ones, or you will never\nreach the desired end.CHAPTER XIII\n\nJUDGES AT THE LONDON SHOWS, 1890-1915\n\n\nThe following are the Judges of a quarter of a century’s Shires in\nLondon:--\n\n    1890.Clark, A.

Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in\nhis introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have\nfirst-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour\nto secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of\nenhancing prices all round.Breeders of Shire horses both in England\nand America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by\nexercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to\npedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only\nreap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to\nthis country.”\n\nFrom the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June\n3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer\nfor Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of\nCanada.Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the\nmerits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many\ngood Shires have gone.In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was\n118.So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United\nStates and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled\nto each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire\nClasses.Another great country with which a good and growing trade has been done\nis Russia.In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to\nfifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be\nextended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about\nthe stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.Our other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore\nthey have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their\nbreeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to\nextinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for\nbuilding up their breeds in days to come.German buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred\nre-mounts have been more in their line.In 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one.By 1910\nthe number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if\nthe export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,\nEnglish breeders will scarcely feel it.Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British\nEmpire to which Shires have been shipped for several years.Substantial\nprizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire\nHorse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign\nand Colonial Shows.ENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES\n\nThe following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”\nfor 1906, and was written by S. H. L.(J. A. Frost):--\n\n    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is\n    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal\n    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,\n    Mr.Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,\n    speaking at Mr.John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,\n    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in\n    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire\n    horses became known, and the more they came into competition\n    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught\n    purposes were appreciated.’\n\n    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have\n    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more\n    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of\n    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,\n    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire\n    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries\n    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade\n    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further\n    development.The number of export certificates granted by the\n    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal\n    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire\n    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,\n    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,\n    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and\n    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a\n    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,\n    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,\n    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more\n    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present\n    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings\n    continue to be scarce and dear.”\n\n\nTHE NUMBER EXPORTED\n\n“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year\nor two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those\nthat go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is\nworked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the\nadmiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,\nexcept in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers\nis to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than\non the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put\nare also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very\nhigh prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same\nspirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal\ncould be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire\nit is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is\nunquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives\nprizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most\nimportant horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the\nbreed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial\nfarmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a\nsimilar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large\nrailway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a\nbinder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West\nTerritory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in\nthe stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are\nkeeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are\ncoming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough\nfor their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only\nkind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which\nis certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the\nnative draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING\n\n“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,\nwhich is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire\nhorse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows\nlike Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at\nthe best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least\nsome of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an\nincrease in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of\na thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;\nbut the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be\nover, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have\ndeclined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the\nrecord average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general\naverage for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the\nhighest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being\n1550 guineas, given by Mr.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre\nChampion, at the late Mr.Crisp’s sale at Girton.Other high-priced\nstallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and\nChancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,\n1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases\nof Mr.These figures show that the\nworth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and\nit is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is\nby no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males\noffered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there\nis ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in\nview and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions\nit behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no\nfalling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American\nword, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that\nvisitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they\ncome to ‘the stud farm of the world.’\n\n“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock\nwhich has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly\nemphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British\nmarket being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of\nmales, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which\nbreeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood\nfamous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,\nNorthwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as\nshowing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after\nyear if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of\nmerit.“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply\nof mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring\nsocieties, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade\nsires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,\nand the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other\ncountries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS\n\n“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for\nShires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,\nbut from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either\nforming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not\nbeen responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable\nthat with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western\nCanada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to\nhelp the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be\nuseful for both tillage and haulage purposes.“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well\nknown, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an\naverage of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British\nbreeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest\nfairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus\nfurther the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the\nexport trade.”\n\nIt may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and\nLord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of\nAmerica for exhibition.CHAPTER XV\n\nPROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS\n\n\nSeeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge\ncups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name\nis mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show\nof 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased\nthe second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by\nLincolnshire Lad II.)He is\nremembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short\nlegs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been\nfound at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and\nthird with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan\nand Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).The former won the\nFilly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud\nof Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a\nvery high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,\nwhich won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him\n750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord\nRothschild’s stud.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in\n1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as\nmodels of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in\n1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win\nhighest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through\nLord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as\na two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.\nWhitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,\nso we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central\nfigure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,\nWoldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the\nTring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire\nHorse Society.At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased\nWindley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old\nfilly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.At the\nTandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the\nLockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir\nWalpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King\nblood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at\nthe Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a\nbrilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.\nEwart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at\nPeterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt\ndeserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD\n\nAt the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased\nDunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,\nfor 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won\nsecond and third for him in London the same month, this being the first\nshow at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by\nMessrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas\ncreated quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so\nfor nearly four years.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is\nMollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is\nLorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased\nprivately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines\nis Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,\nwon first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards\nselling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With\nsuch animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,\nalthough they do not come from the district known to the law makers of\nold as the breeding ground of “the Great Horse.”\n\n\nTHE PENDLEY FEMALES\n\nOne of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at\nthe shows of the past few seasons has been Mr.J. G. Williams, Pendley\nManor, Tring.Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under\nnotice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.In 1908 Lord\nEgerton’s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having\nbeen first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest\nPrincess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup\nwinner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named.At the\nTring Park sale of 1913 Mr.Williams gave the highest price made by\na female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest\nKing.She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him.One of the\nlater acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and\nreserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the\nRoyal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough.Williams joined the\nShire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London\nChampionship with his mares and fillies.A NEW STUD\n\nAfter Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr.Beck announced that\nthe disappointed bidder was Mr.C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the\nEdgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission\nto the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,\n1913.Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and\nhalf brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown\nin London just after, where he won fourth prize.From this single entry\nin 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries\nwere made at the 1914 London Show.Fine Feathers was the first prize\nyearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,\nthe own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.After the show Lord Rothschild’s first prize two-year colt, Orfold\nBlue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize\nyearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill\nForest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,\nLtd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914.In future Edgcote\npromises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its\nShorthorns.DUCAL STUDS\n\nA very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace\nthe Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton\nNunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.Shires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the\nstud contains many promising animals now.Mention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke\nof Devonshire who, as the Hon.Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class\nstud at Holker, Lancs.At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker\nMars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the\nNorwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912\nfor his popular owner.OTHER STUDS\n\nAmong those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old\nEnglish type of cart-horse, the name of Mr.Clement Keevil deserves\na foremost place.At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of\nstud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for\nmassive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree\nwhich traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the\nyear 1769, to Wiseman’s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire\nweighing 1 ton 8 cwt.Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where\nseveral sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.Everard gave\n860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon.Shortly before that he\nsold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.The prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in show catalogues for a number of\nyears, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by\nLord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen\nto found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the\nShire Horse Society.As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two\nentries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s own sire, Northwood, to which\nreference is made elsewhere.Another notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in\nLondon, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall\nMenestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild\nas a yearling.As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve\nChampion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner.A good bidder at\nShire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of\nthe Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion\nhonours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.Another stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr.A. Grandage, has\nnow been removed to Cheshire.Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,\nhis first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in\n1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of\nLincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr.Edward Green for 825\nguineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr.Grandage,\nseeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two\nfollowing years, 1910 and 1911.Candidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are\nlikely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.Among those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,\nHighfield, Leek, Staffs.His first London success was third prize with\nRokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he\nhas taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and\nhas the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced\nmare yet sold by auction.At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second\nhighest price of that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old\nstallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won first prize for him in London\nten days after, but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for the\nWinslow Shire Horse Society, and died.Another bad loss to Sir Arthur\nand to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,\nseeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest\nKing, for begetting show animals.Among the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be\nmentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,\nfirst as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by\nRedlynch Forest King.With such as these coming on there is a future\nbefore the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame\nachieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz.F. E. Muntz,\nof Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore\nBaronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.Quite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for\nthe best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914.The winner,\nDanesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on\nboth occasions, and this typical “Old English Black” had a host of\nadmirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his\nparade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.It used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but\nMr.Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove\notherwise.Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered\nquite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of\nhigh-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,\nand a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge\n(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr.Salomons at the Tandridge\ndispersion sale for 1600 guineas.At the sale during the London Show of\n1914 Mr.Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury\nCoronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his\nclass, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,\nby the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both\nbeing three years old.This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,\nno matter where its situation.Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who\nhas been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.He purchased\nDanesfield Stonewall from Mr.R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes\nbefore re-selling him to Mr.His stud horses now includes\nMarathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910.Mares and\nfillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and\nother meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.A fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,\nGarstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,\nKing’s Choice, was bred by Messrs.J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won\nfirst with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.John Ferneyhough\ntook first prize as a three-year-old.With stallions of his type and\nmares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s Choice (by Childwick\nChampion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these\nLancashire breeders.The Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late\nMr.James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908.His business abilities\nand keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged\nin London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.This being a\nrecord in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great\nShow of the breed.Carlton has always been famous for its stallions.It has furnished\nLondon winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom\n(1902 and 1903), Present King II.(1906), and Stolen Duchess, the\nChallenge Cup winning mare of 1907.Forshaw and his sons are too numerous\nto mention in detail.Another very\nimpressive stallion was What’s Wanted, the sire of Mr.A. C. Duncombe’s\nPremier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of\ncelebrated sons.His great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509, a\ngreat sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate\nfor thirteen consecutive seasons.Forshaw’s opinion\nof him is given on another page.One of the most successful Carlton\nsires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray\nKing, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when\nsold.Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud\nthrough several decades of last century, and that a large number have\nbeen travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has\nbeen done by Messrs.Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the\ninfluence of this stud has been world-wide.It is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book\nlike this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that\nthey are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,\ntherefore they have “kept the ball rolling,” viz.Thomas\nEwart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud\nof the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was\ndispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of\nwhich is Dunsmore Chessie.R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires\nof Mr.R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at\nDanesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking\nover the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire\nbreeding quite successfully on his own account.The other of this class to be named is Mr.C. E. McKenna, who took over\nthe Bardon stud from Mr.B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let\nthe Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last\nand worthiest years.Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate\nmeans faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither\nlandowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be\nmentioned Mr.James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon\nMenestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at\nthe 1914 London Show; Messrs.E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,\nwho won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards\nselling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree\nwith him two years later.Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the\nexhibitors’ list at the London Show of 1899.Perhaps his most notable\nhorse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth\nprize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs.Potter’s King’s Choice\nabove mentioned.Many other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and\nspace permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his\nbest colts “Sign of Riches,” which must be regarded as an advertisement\nfor the breed from a farmer’s point of view.Of past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter\nGilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915.The first\nShire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the\nlate Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by\nSpark, the average of £172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby\nsale of 1891 (which was £198 17_s._ 3_d._).Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse\nSociety; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by\npresenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering\n1250.The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)\nat the London Show of 1891.CHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\n\nThis book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the\nabsorbing topic.In fact, no other will be listened to.What is\nthe good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of\nagriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence?To a\ncertain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more\nparticularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three\nseasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses\ncoming along for future use.The cry of the army authorities is for “more and more men,” together\nwith a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including\nthe weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no\nprovision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the\nguns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and\nmost others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.The motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals\nwho have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered\nmountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable\nfor mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or\ndrawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.When the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,\nhorse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before.But horses,\nparticularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use.So far, coal\nmerchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry\nusers have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.For taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy\nhorses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they\nhave ever been.The railways will continue to exist, and, while they\ndo, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the\nnecessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.During the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got\nplenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,\n“grow more wheat.”\n\nIf this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at\nleast to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,\nthat more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat.The land\nhas to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home\nand delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.It may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam\nwaggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.Moreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or\nstanding idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare\ndoes not do.If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value\nfrom the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years\nold, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make\nroom for younger animals.Horse power is therefore the cheapest and\nmost satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field\nimplements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of\nthe Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.When awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--\n\n“General Management with a view to profit,” so that any breed of live\nstock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.Only a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord\nthat Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the\nrent audit, “with a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.”\n\nMost landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,\ntherefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have\ndone during the past twenty-five years.Wars come to an end--the “Thirty Years’ War” did--so let us remember\nthe Divine promise to Noah after the flood, “While the earth remaineth\nseedtime and harvest … shall not cease,” Gen.As long as there is\nsowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.“Far back in the ages\n      The plough with wreaths was crowned;\n    The hands of kings and sages\n      Entwined the chaplet round;\n    Till men of spoil disdained the toil\n      By which the world was nourished,\n    And dews of blood enriched the soil\n      Where green their laurels flourished:\n    Now the world her fault repairs--\n      The guilt that stains her story;\n    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares\n      That formed her earliest glory.The glory, earned in deadly fray,\n      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o’er all the Earth\n      Through endless generations,\n    The art that calls her harvests forth\n      And feeds the expectant nations.”\n\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\n\n    A\n\n    Alston Rose, champion mare 1901 … 104\n\n    Armour-clad warriors, 1, 7\n\n    Army horses, 6\n\n    Ashbourne Foal Show, 80\n\n    Attention to feet, 42\n\n    Aurea, champion mare, 18, 65\n\n    Author’s Preface, v\n\n    Average prices, 76\n\n\n    B\n\n    Back breeding, value of, 11, 13, 39\n\n    Bakewell, Robert, 2, 22, 54\n\n    Bardon Extraordinary, champion gelding, 65, 78\n\n    Bardon Stud, 118\n\n    Bar None, 80\n\n    Bearwardcote Blaze, 60\n\n    Bedding, 35\n\n    Birdsall Menestrel, 84, 111\n\n    ---- stud, 110\n\n    Black horses, Bakewell’s, 55\n\n    Black horses from Flanders, 58\n\n    Blagdon Stud, 110\n\n    Blending Shire and Clydesdale breeds, 59\n\n    Boiled barley, 36\n\n    Bradley, Mr.John, 83\n\n    Bramhope stud, 111\n\n    Breeders, farmer, 27\n\n    Breeders, prizes for, 65\n\n    Breeding from fillies, 17\n\n    Breeding, time for, 31\n\n    Bury Victor Chief, champion in 1892 … 68, 69\n\n    Buscot Harold, champion stallion, 17, 65\n\n\n    C\n\n    Calwich Stud, 61, 80\n\n    Canada, 101\n\n    Carbonite, 103\n\n    Care of the feet, 42\n\n    Carlton Stud, 116\n\n    Cart-colts, 23\n\n    Cart-horses, 54\n\n    Castrating colts, 39\n\n    Certificate of Soundness, 62\n\n    Champion’s Goalkeeper, champion in 1913 and 1914 … 67, 104\n\n    Champions bred at Sandringham, 3\n\n    Cheap sires, 12\n\n    Clark, Mr.A.

for know that, were you to do so in the most\nremote corner of Scotland, I have ears to hear it even there, and a\nhand and poniard to reach a traitor\'s bosom.I am--but the word will not\nout!""Do not speak it then," said the prudent glover: "a secret is no longer\nsafe when it crosses the lips of him who owns it, and I desire not a\nconfidence so dangerous as you menace me with.""Ay, but I must speak, and you must hear," said the youth."In this age\nof battle, father, you have yourself been a combatant?""Once only," replied Simon, "when the Southron assaulted the Fair City.I was summoned to take my part in the defence, as my tenure required,\nlike that of other craftsmen, who are bound to keep watch and ward.""What can that import to the present business?""Much, else I had not asked the question," answered.Eachin, in the tone\nof haughtiness which from time to time he assumed."An old man is easily brought to speak of olden times," said Simon, not\nunwilling, on an instant\'s reflection, to lead the conversation away\nfrom the subject of his daughter, "and I must needs confess my feelings\nwere much short of the high, cheerful confidence, nay, the pleasure,\nwith which I have seen other men go to battle.My life and profession\nwere peaceful, and though I have not wanted the spirit of a man, when\nthe time demanded it, yet I have seldom slept worse than the night\nbefore that onslaught.My ideas were harrowed by the tales we were\ntold--nothing short of the truth--about the Saxon archers: how they drew\nshafts of a cloth yard length, and used bows a third longer than ours.When I fell into a broken slumber, if but a straw in the mattress\npricked my side I started and waked, thinking an English arrow was\nquivering in my body.In the morning, as I began for very weariness to\nsink into some repose, I was waked by the tolling of the common bell,\nwhich called us burghers to the walls; I never heard its sound peal so\nlike a passing knell before or since.""I did on my harness," said Simon, "such as it was; took my mother\'s\nblessing, a high spirited woman, who spoke of my father\'s actions for\nthe honour of the Fair Town.This heartened me, and I felt still bolder\nwhen I found myself ranked among the other crafts, all bowmen, for thou\nknowest the Perth citizens have good skill in archery.We were dispersed\non the walls, several knights and squires in armour of proof being\nmingled amongst us, who kept a bold countenance, confident perhaps in\ntheir harness, and informed us, for our encouragement, that they would\ncut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to\nquit their post.I was kindly assured of this myself by the old Kempe\nof Kinfauns, as he was called, this good Sir Patrick\'s father, then our\nprovost.He was a grandson of the Red Rover, Tom of Longueville, and\na likely man to keep his word, which he addressed to me in especial,\nbecause a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than\nusual; and, besides, I was but a lad.""And did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution?"said\nEachin, who seemed very attentive."To my resolution," answered Simon; "for I think nothing can make a\nman so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the\nknowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward.Well, I\nmounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the\nSpey Tower, being accounted a good bowman.But a very cold fit seized me\nas I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,\nand their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong\ncolumns, three in number.They came on steadily, and some of us would\nfain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were\nobliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement\nas we best might.As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,\neach man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover\nthemselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before\nthem, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home\nfor a glass of distilled waters.But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy\nKempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he\nshould waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English\nwere in presence; so I e\'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable\nangle, formed by two battlements.The English then strode forward, and\ndrew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but\nto the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could\ncall on St.I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I\nbelieve I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town\ncrier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took\nheart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim.A\nlittle man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,\ndropt with a shaft through his shoulder.The provost cried, \'Well\nstitched, Simon Glover!\'John, for his own town, my fellow\ncraftsmen!\'shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice.And if you\nwill believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the\nfoes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if\nI had been shooting at butts instead of men\'s breasts.I gained\nsome credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of\nnecessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not\nhave lost it again.And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in\nbattle.Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like\na wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a\ntrue one.Upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in\nScotland.""I understand your tale," said Eachin; "but I shall find it difficult\nto make you credit mine, knowing the race of which I am descended, and\nespecially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the\ntomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to\nhear!Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a\nfew minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale\nwill be told.Father, I am--a COWARD!It is said at last, and the secret\nof my disgrace is in keeping of another!"The young man sunk back in a species of syncope, produced by the agony\nof his mind as he made the fatal communication.The glover, moved as\nwell by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,\nand succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure.He hid\nhis face with his hands, and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly."For Our Lady\'s sake, be composed," said the old man, "and recall the\nvile word!I know you better than yourself: you are no coward, but only\ntoo young and inexperienced, ay, and somewhat too quick of fancy, to\nhave the steady valour of a bearded man.I would hear no other man say\nthat of you, Conachar, without giving him the lie.You are no coward:\nI have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough\nprovocation."said the unfortunate youth; "but\nwhen saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed\nthem?The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece\nof ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged\nme to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly.""Want of habit," said Simon; "it is by clambering over walls that youths\nlearn to scale precipices.Begin with slight feuds; exercise daily the\narms of your country in tourney with your followers."exclaimed the young chief,\nstarting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination."How\nmany days are there betwixt this hour and Palm Sunday, and what is to\nchance then?A list inclosed, from which no man can stir, more than the\npoor bear who is chained to his stake.Sixty living men, the best\nand fiercest--one alone excepted!--which Albyn can send down from her\nmountains, all athirst for each other\'s blood, while a king and his\nnobles, and shouting thousands besides, attend, as at a theatre, to\nencourage their demoniac fury!Blows clang and blood flows, thicker,\nfaster, redder; they rush on each other like madmen, they tear each\nother like wild beasts; the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet\nof their companions!Blood ebbs, arms become weak; but there must be\nno parley, no truce, no interruption, while any of the maimed wretches\nremain alive!Here is no crouching behind battlements, no fighting with\nmissile weapons: all is hand to hand, till hands can no longer be raised\nto maintain the ghastly conflict!If such a field is so horrible in\nidea, what think you it will be in reality?""I can only pity you, Conachar," said Simon."It is hard to be the\ndescendant of a lofty line--the son of a noble father--the leader by\nbirth of a gallant array, and yet to want, or think you want, for\nstill I trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy, that over estimates\ndanger--to want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game\ncock that is worth a handful of corn, every hound that is worth a\nmess of offal.But how chanced it that, with such a consciousness of\ninability to fight in this battle, you proffered even now to share your\nchiefdom with my daughter?Your power must depend on your fighting this\ncombat, and in that Catharine cannot help you.""You mistake, old man," replied Eachin: "were Catharine to look kindly\non the earnest love I bear her, it would carry me against the front of\nthe enemies with the mettle of a war horse.Overwhelming as my sense\nof weakness is, the feeling that Catharine looked on would give me\nstrength.Say yet--oh, say yet--she shall be mine if we gain the combat,\nand not the Gow Chrom himself, whose heart is of a piece with his\nanvil, ever went to battle so light as I shall do!One strong passion is\nconquered by another."Cannot the recollection of your interest, your\nhonour, your kindred, do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of\na brent browed lass?"You tell me but what I have told myself, but it is in vain," replied\nEachin, with a sigh."It is only whilst the timid stag is paired with\nthe doe that he is desperate and dangerous.Be it from constitution; be\nit, as our Highland cailliachs will say, from the milk of the white\ndoe; be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict\nrestraint; be it, as you think, from an overheated fancy, which paints\ndanger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality, I cannot\ntell.But I know my failing, and--yes, it must be said!--so sorely dread\nthat I cannot conquer it, that, could I have your consent to my wishes\non such terms, I would even here make a pause, renounce the rank I have\nassumed, and retire into humble life.""What, turn glover at last, Conachar?""This beats the\nlegend of St.Nay--nay, your hand was not framed for that: you\nshall spoil me no more doe skins.""Jest not," said Eachin, "I am serious.If I cannot labour, I will bring\nwealth enough to live without it.They will proclaim me recreant with\nhorn and war pipe.Catharine will love me the better\nthat I have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed, and\nFather Clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world, which will\nload us with reproaches that wound not.I shall be the happiest of men;\nCatharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her,\nand will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror\nwhich your ill assorted match would have prepared for her; and you,\nfather Glover, shall occupy your chimney corner, the happiest and most\nhonoured man that ever--"\n\n"Hold, Eachin--I prithee, hold," said the glover; "the fir light, with\nwhich this discourse must terminate, burns very low, and I would speak\na word in my turn, and plain dealing is best.Though it may vex,\nor perhaps enrage, you, let me end these visions by saying at once:\nCatharine can never be yours.A glove is the emblem of faith, and a\nman of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own.Catharine\'s hand is promised--promised to a man whom you may hate, but\nwhom you must honour--to Henry the armourer.The match is fitting by\ndegree, agreeable to their mutual wishes, and I have given my promise.It is best to be plain at once; resent my refusal as you will--I am\nwholly in your power.The glover spoke thus decidedly, because he was aware from experience\nthat the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in\nmost cases to stern and decided resolution.Yet, recollecting where he\nwas, it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap\nup and spread a flash of light on the visage of Eachin, which seemed\npale as the grave, while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his\nfever fit.The light instantly sunk down and died, and Simon felt a\nmomentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with\nthe youth, whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly\nexcited, however short a period his nature could support the measures\nwhich his passion commenced.He was relieved by the voice of Eachin, who\nmuttered in a hoarse and altered tone:\n\n"Let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever.If thou\nbring\'st it to light, thou wert better dig thine own grave."Thus speaking, the door of the hut opened, admitting a gleam of\nmoonshine.The form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant, the\nhurdle was then closed, and the shieling left in darkness.Simon Glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and\ndanger was thus peaceably terminated.But he remained deeply affected by\nthe condition of Hector MacIan, whom he had himself bred up."The poor child," said he, "to be called up to a place of eminence,\nonly to be hurled from it with contempt!What he told me I partly knew,\nhaving often remarked that Conachar was more prone to quarrel than to\nfight.But this overpowering faint heartedness, which neither shame\nnor necessity can overcome, I, though no Sir William Wallace, cannot\nconceive.And to propose himself for a husband to my daughter, as if\na bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom!No--no,\nCatharine must wed a man to whom she may say, \'Husband, spare your\nenemy\'--not one in whose behalf she must cry, \'Generous enemy, spare my\nhusband!"Tired out with these reflections, the old man at length fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by his friend the Booshalloch, who, with\nsomething of a blank visage, proposed to him to return to his abode on\nthe meadow at the Ballough.He apologised that the chief could not see\nSimon Glover that morning, being busied with things about the expected\ncombat; and that Eachin MacIan thought the residence at the Ballough\nwould be safest for Simon Glover\'s health, and had given charge that\nevery care should be taken for his protection and accommodation.Niel Booshalloch dilated on these circumstances, to gloss over the\nneglect implied in the chief\'s dismissing his visitor without a\nparticular audience."His father knew better," said the herdsman."But where should he have\nlearned manners, poor thing, and bred up among your Perth burghers, who,\nexcepting yourself, neighbour Glover, who speak Gaelic as well as I do,\nare a race incapable of civility?"Simon Glover, it may be well believed, felt none of the want of respect\nwhich his friend resented on his account.On the contrary, he greatly\npreferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous\nhospitality of the daily festival of the chief, even if there had not\njust passed an interview with Eachin upon a subject which it would be\nmost painful to revive.To the Ballough, therefore, he quietly retreated, where, could he have\nbeen secure of Catharine\'s safety, his leisure was spent pleasantly\nenough.His amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff, which a\nHighland boy managed, while the old man angled.He frequently landed\non the little island, where he mused over the tomb of his old friend\nGilchrist MacIan, and made friends with the monks, presenting the prior\nwith gloves of martens\' fur, and the superior officers with each of them\na pair made from the skin of the wildcat.The cutting and stitching of\nthese little presents served to beguile the time after sunset, while\nthe family of the herdsman crowded around, admiring his address, and\nlistening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to\npass away a heavy evening.It must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation\nof Father Clement, whom he erroneously considered as rather the author\nof his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them."I will not," he\nthought, "to please his fancies, lose the goodwill of these kind\nmonks, which may be one day useful to me.I have suffered enough by his\npreachments already, I trow.Little the wiser and much the poorer they\nhave made me.No--no, Catharine and Clement may think as they will; but\nI will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at\nthe call of his master, submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and\nwhipcord, disburse a lusty mulct, and become whole with the church\nagain."More than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at\nBallough, and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of Catharine\nor of Henry Wynd, to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the\nplan and place of his retreat.He knew the stout smith dared not come\nup into the Clan Quhele country, on account of various feuds with\nthe inhabitants, and with Eachin himself, while bearing the name of\nConachar; but yet the glover thought Henry might have found means to\nsend him a message, or a token, by some one of the various couriers who\npassed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the Clan\nQuhele, in order to concert the terms of the impending combat, the\nmarch of the parties to Perth, and other particulars requiring previous\nadjustment.It was now the middle of March, and the fatal Palm Sunday\nwas fast approaching.Whilst time was thus creeping on, the exiled glover had not even once\nset eyes upon his former apprentice.The care that was taken to attend\nto his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not\nforgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain\'s horn ringing through\nthe woods, he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different\ndirection.One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in\nEachin\'s close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus\nit happened.As Simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade, surrounded\non either side with tall forest trees, mixed with underwood, a white doe\nbroke from the thicket, closely pursued by two deer greyhounds, one\nof which griped her haunch, the other her throat, and pulled her down\nwithin half a furlong of the glover, who was something startled at the\nsuddenness of the incident.The ear and piercing blast of a horn, and\nthe baying of a slow hound, made Simon aware that the hunters were close\nbehind, and on the trace of the deer.Hallooing and the sound of\nmen running through the copse were heard close at hand.A moment\'s\nrecollection would have satisfied Simon that his best way was to stand\nfast, or retire slowly, and leave it to Eachin to acknowledge his\npresence or not, as he should see cause.But his desire of shunning the\nyoung man had grown into a kind of instinct, and in the alarm of finding\nhim so near, Simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly,\nwhich altogether concealed him.He had hardly done so ere Eachin, rosy\nwith exercise, dashed from the thicket into the open glade, accompanied\nby his foster father, Torquil of the Oak.The latter, with equal\nstrength and address, turned the struggling hind on her back, and\nholding her forefeet in his right hand, while he knelt on her body,\noffered his skene with the left to the young chief, that he might cut\nthe animal\'s throat."It may not be, Torquil; do thine office, and take the assay thyself.I\nmust not kill the likeness of my foster--"\n\nThis was spoken with a melancholy smile, while a tear at the same time\nstood in the speaker\'s eye.Torquil stared at his young chief for an\ninstant, then drew his sharp wood knife across the creature\'s throat\nwith a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone.Then rising on his feet, and again fixing a long piercing look on his\nchief, he said: "As much as I have done to that hind would I do to any\nliving man whose ears could have heard my dault (foster son) so much as\nname a white doe, and couple the word with Hector\'s name!"If Simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed, this speech of\nTorquil furnished him with a pressing one."It cannot be concealed, father Torquil," said Eachin: "it will all out\nto the broad day.""It is the fatal secret," thought Simon; "and now, if this huge privy\ncouncillor cannot keep silence, I shall be made answerable, I suppose,\nfor Eachin\'s disgrace having been blown abroad."Thinking thus anxiously, he availed himself at the same time of his\nposition to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted\nchieftain and his confidant, impelled by that spirit of curiosity which\nprompts us in the most momentous, as well as the most trivial, occasions\nof life, and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great\npersonal fear.As Torquil listened to what Eachin communicated, the young man sank\ninto his arms, and, supporting himself on his shoulder, concluded his\nconfession by a whisper into his ear.Torquil seemed to listen with such\namazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears.As if to be\ncertain that it was Eachin who spoke, he gradually roused the youth from\nhis reclining posture, and, holding him up in some measure by a grasp on\nhis shoulder, fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged, and at the same\ntime turned to stone, by the marvels he listened to.And so wild waxed\nthe old man\'s visage after he had heard the murmured communication,\nthat Simon Glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a\ndishonoured thing, in which case he might have lighted among the very\ncopse in which he lay concealed, and occasioned his discovery in a\nmanner equally painful and dangerous.But the passions of Torquil,\nwho entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that\npassionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the Highlands\ntook a different turn."I believe it not," he exclaimed; "it is false of thy father\'s child,\nfalse of thy mother\'s son, falsest of my dault!I offer my gage to\nheaven and hell, and will maintain the combat with him that shall call\nit true.Thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye, my darling, and the\nfainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic.I remember the\nbat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert born--that hour\nof grief and of joy.Thou shalt with me to Iona,\nand the good St.Columbus, with the whole choir of blessed saints and\nangels, who ever favoured thy race, shall take from thee the heart of\nthe white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee."Eachin listened, with a look as if he would fain have believed the words\nof the comforter."But, Torquil," he said, "supposing this might avail us, the fatal day\napproaches, and if I go to the lists, I dread me we shall be shamed.""Hell shall not prevail so\nfar: we will steep thy sword in holy water, place vervain, St.John\'s\nWort, and rowan tree in thy crest.We will surround thee, I and thy\neight brethren: thou shalt be safe as in a castle."Again the youth helplessly uttered something, which, from the dejected\ntone in which it was spoken, Simon could not understand, while Torquil\'s\ndeep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear."Yes, there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict.Thou\nart the youngest who is to draw blade.Now, hear me, and thou shalt know\nwhat it is to have a foster father\'s love, and how far it exceeds the\nlove even of kinsmen.The youngest on the indenture of the Clan Chattan\nis Ferquhard Day.His father slew mine, and the red blood is seething\nhot between us; I looked to Palm Sunday as the term that should cool it.Thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this\nFerquhard Day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into\nthe same vessel, yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only\ndaughter Eva, the fairest of our maidens.Think with what feelings I\nheard the news.It was as if a wolf from the skirts of Farragon had\nsaid, \'Give me thy child in wedlock, Torquil.\'My child thought not\nthus: she loves Ferquhard, and weeps away her colour and strength in\ndread of the approaching battle.Let her give him but a sign of favour,\nand well I know he will forget kith and kin, forsake the field, and fly\nwith her to the desert.""He, the youngest of the champions of Clan Chattan, being absent, I, the\nyoungest of the Clan Quhele, may be excused from combat" said Eachin,\nblushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him."See now, my chief;" said Torquil, "and judge my thoughts towards\nthee: others might give thee their own lives and that of their sons--I\nsacrifice to thee the honour of my house.""My friend--my father," repeated the chief, folding Torquil to his\nbosom, "what a base wretch am I that have a spirit dastardly enough to\navail myself of your sacrifice!"Let us back to the camp, and\nsend our gillies for the venison.The slowhound, or lyme dog, luckily for Simon, had drenched his nose in\nthe blood of the deer, else he might have found the glover\'s lair in the\nthicket; but its more acute properties of scent being lost, it followed\ntranquilly with the gazehounds.When the hunters were out of sight and hearing, the glover arose,\ngreatly relieved by their departure, and began to move off in the\nopposite direction as fast as his age permitted.His first reflection\nwas on the fidelity of the foster father."The wild mountain heart is faithful and true.Yonder man is more like\nthe giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet\nChristians might take an example from him for his lealty.A simple\ncontrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies\'\nchequer, as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply\nhis place."Thus thought the glover, not aware that the strictest proclamations\nwere issued, prohibiting any of the two contending clans, their friends,\nallies, and dependants, from coming within fifty miles of Perth, during\na week before and a week after the combat, which regulation was to be\nenforced by armed men.So soon as our friend Simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman,\nhe found other news awaiting him.They were brought by Father Clement,\nwho came in a pilgrim\'s cloak, or dalmatic, ready to commence his return\nto the southward, and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile,\nor to accept him as a travelling companion."But what," said the citizen, "has so suddenly induced you to return\nwithin the reach of danger?""Have you not heard," said Father Clement, "that, March and his English\nallies having retired into England before the Earl of Douglas, the good\nearl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth, and\nhath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the High\nCourt of Commission against heresy be withdrawn, as a trouble to men\'s\nconsciences, that the nomination of Henry of Wardlaw to be prelate of\nSt.Andrews be referred to the Parliament, with sundry other things\npleasing to the Commons?Now, most of the nobles that are with the King\nat Perth, and with them Sir Patrick Charteris, your worthy provost, have\ndeclared for the proposals of the Douglas.The Duke of Albany had agreed\nto them--whether from goodwill or policy I know not.The good King is\neasily persuaded to mild and gentle courses.And thus are the jaw\nteeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets, and the prey\nsnatched from their ravening talons.Will you with me to the Lowlands,\nor do you abide here a little space?"Neil Booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply."He had the chief\'s authority," he said, "for saying that Simon Glover\nshould abide until the champions went down to the battle."In this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his\nown perfect freedom of volition; but he cared little for it at the\ntime, as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the\nclergyman."An exemplary man," he said to his friend Niel Booshalloch, as soon as\nFather Clement had taken leave--"a great scholar and a great saint.It\nis a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon\nat the stake would convert thousands.O Niel Booshalloch, Father\nClement\'s pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to\nall decent Christians!But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant\nburgess like me serve?Men offer not up old glove leather for incense,\nnor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow.Sooth to speak, I have\ntoo little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and,\ntherefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the\nscorn.""True for you," answered the herdsman.We must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we\n     left at Perth, when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter\n     to Kinfauns, and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of\n     Simon to Loch Tay; and the Prince, as the highest personage, claims\n     our immediate attention.This rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his\nsequestered residence with the Lord High Constable, with whose company,\notherwise in every respect satisfactory, he became dissatisfied, from\nno other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his\nwarder.Incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father, he\nlonged, not unnaturally, for the society of Sir John Ramorny, on whom he\nhad been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement, and, though\nhe would have resented the imputation as an insult, for guidance and\ndirection.He therefore sent him a summons to attend him, providing his\nhealth permitted; and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion\nin the High Constable\'s garden, which, like that of Sir John\'s own\nlodgings, ran down to the Tay.In renewing an intimacy so dangerous,\nRothsay only remembered that he had been Sir Join Ramorny\'s munificent\nfriend; while Sir John, on receiving the invitation, only recollected,\non his part, the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron,\nthe loss of his hand, and the lightness with which he had treated the\nsubject, and the readiness with which Rothsay had abandoned his cause in\nthe matter of the bonnet maker\'s slaughter.He laughed bitterly when he\nread the Prince\'s billet."Eviot," he said, "man a stout boat with six trusty men--trusty men,\nmark me--lose not a moment, and bid Dwining instantly come hither."Heaven smiles on us, my trusty friend," he said to the mediciner."I\nwas but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy, and here\nhe sends to invite me."I see the matter very clearly," said Dwining."Heaven smiles on\nsome untoward consequences--he!"No matter, the trap is ready; and it is baited, too, my friend, with\nwhat would lure the boy from a sanctuary, though a troop with drawn\nweapons waited him in the churchyard.His own weariness of himself would have done the job.Get thy matters\nready--thou goest with us.Write to him, as I cannot, that we come\ninstantly to attend his commands, and do it clerkly.He reads well, and\nthat he owes to me.""He will be your valiancie\'s debtor for more knowledge before he\ndies--he!But is your bargain sure with the Duke of Albany?""Enough to gratify my ambition, thy avarice, and the revenge of both.Aboard--aboard, and speedily; let Eviot throw in a few flasks of the\nchoicest wine, and some cold baked meats.""But your arm, my lord, Sir John?"The throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound.It beats as it\nwould burst my bosom."said Dwining; adding, in a low voice--"It would be a\nstrange sight if it should.I should like to dissect it, save that its\nstony case would spoil my best instruments."In a few minutes they were in the boat, while a speedy messenger carried\nthe note to the Prince.Rothsay was seated with the Constable, after their noontide repast.He\nwas sullen and silent; and the earl had just asked whether it was his\npleasure that the table should be cleared, when a note, delivered to the\nPrince, changed at once his aspect."I go to the pavilion in the garden--always\nwith permission of my Lord Constable--to receive my late master of the\nhorse.""Ay, my lord; must I ask permission twice?""No, surely, my lord," answered the Constable; "but has your Royal\nHighness recollected that Sir John Ramorny--"\n\n"Has not the plague, I hope?""Come, Errol,\nyou would play the surly turnkey, but it is not in your nature; farewell\nfor half an hour."said Errol, as the Prince, flinging open a lattice of\nthe ground parlour in which they sat, stept out into the garden--"a new\nfolly, to call back that villain to his counsels.The Prince, in the mean time, looked back, and said hastily:\n\n"Your lordship\'s good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of\nwine and a slight collation in the pavilion?I love the al fresco of the\nriver."The Constable bowed, and gave the necessary orders; so that Sir John\nfound the materials of good cheer ready displayed, when, landing from\nhis barge, he entered the pavilion."It grieves my heart to see your Highness under restraint," said\nRamorny, with a well executed appearance of sympathy."That grief of thine will grieve mine," said the Prince."I am sure here\nhas Errol, and a right true hearted lord he is, so tired me with grave\nlooks, and something like grave lessons, that he has driven me back to\nthee, thou reprobate, from whom, as I expect nothing good, I may perhaps\nobtain something entertaining.Yet, ere we say more, it was foul work,\nthat upon the Fastern\'s Even, Ramorny.I well hope thou gavest not aim\nto it.""On my honour, my lord, a simple mistake of the brute Bonthron.I did\nhint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom I had\nlost a hand; and lo you, my knave makes a double mistake.He takes one\nman for another, and instead of the baton he uses the axe.""It is well that it went no farther.Small matter for the bonnet maker;\nbut I had never forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his\nmatch in Britain.But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?""If thirty feet might serve," replied Ramorny.no more of him," said Rothsay; "his wretched name makes the good\nwine taste of blood.And what are the news in Perth, Ramorny?How stands\nit with the bona robas and the galliards?""Little galliardise stirring, my lord," answered the knight."All eyes\nare turned to the motions of the Black Douglas, who comes with five\nthousand chosen men to put us all to rights, as if he were bound for\nanother Otterburn.It is said he is to be lieutenant again.It is\ncertain many have declared for his faction.""It is time, then, my feet were free," said Rothsay, "otherwise I may\nfind a worse warder than Errol."were you once away from this place, you might make as bold\na head as Douglas.""Ramorny," said the Prince, gravely, "I have but a confused remembrance\nof your once having proposed something horrible to me.I would be free--I would have my person at my own disposal; but\nI will never levy arms against my father, nor those it pleases him to\ntrust.""It was only for your Royal Highness\'s personal freedom that I was\npresuming to speak," answered Ramorny."Were I in your Grace\'s place,\nI would get me into that good boat which hovers on the Tay, and drop\nquietly down to Fife, where you have many friends, and make free to take\npossession of Falkland.It is a royal castle; and though the King has\nbestowed it in gift on your uncle, yet surely, even if the grant were\nnot subject to challenge, your Grace might make free with the residence\nof so near a relative.""He hath made free with mine," said the Duke, "as the stewartry of\nRenfrew can tell.But stay, Ramorny--hold; did I not hear Errol say\nthat the Lady Marjory Douglas, whom they call Duchess of Rothsay, is\nat Falkland?I would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by\ndislodging her.""The lady was there, my lord," replied Ramorny; "I have sure advice that\nshe is gone to meet her father."or perhaps to beg him to spare\nme, providing I come on my knees to her bed, as pilgrims say the emirs\nand amirals upon whom a Saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage\nare bound to do?Ramorny, I will act by the Douglas\'s own saying, \'It\nis better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.\'I will keep both\nfoot and hand from fetters.""No place fitter than Falkland," replied Ramorny."I have enough of good\nyeomen to keep the place; and should your Highness wish to leave it, a\nbrief ride reaches the sea in three directions."Neither mirth, music,\nnor maidens--ha!""Pardon me, noble Duke; but, though the Lady Marjory Douglas be\ndeparted, like an errant dame in romance, to implore succour of her\ndoughty sire, there is, I may say, a lovelier, I am sure a younger,\nmaiden, either presently at Falkland or who will soon be on the road\nthither.Your Highness has not forgotten the Fair Maid of Perth?""Forget the prettiest wench in Scotland!No--any more than thou hast\nforgotten the hand that thou hadst in the Curfew Street onslaught on St.Your Highness would say, the hand that I lost.As\ncertain as I shall never regain it, Catharine Glover is, or will soon\nbe, at Falkland.I will not flatter your Highness by saying she\nexpects to meet you; in truth, she proposes to place herself under the\nprotection of the Lady Marjory.""The little traitress," said the Prince--"she too to turn against me?"I trust your Grace will make her penance a gentle one," replied the\nknight."Faith, I would have been her father confessor long ago, but I have ever\nfound her coy.""Opportunity was lacking, my lord," replied Ramorny; "and time presses\neven now.""Nay, I am but too apt for a frolic; but my father--"\n\n"He is personally safe," said Ramorny, "and as much at freedom as ever\nhe can be; while your Highness--"\n\n"Must brook fetters, conjugal or literal--I know it.Yonder comes\nDouglas, with his daughter in his hand, as haughty and as harsh featured\nas himself, bating touches of age.""And at Falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in Scotland," said\nRamorny."Here is penance and restraint, yonder is joy and freedom.""Thou hast prevailed, most sage counsellor," replied Rothsay; "but mark\nyou, it shall be the last of my frolics.""I trust so," replied Ramorny; "for, when at liberty, you may make a\ngood accommodation with your royal father.""I will write to him, Ramorny.No, I cannot\nput my thoughts in words--do thou write.""Your Royal Highness forgets," said Ramorny, pointing to his mutilated\narm."So please your Highness," answered his counsellor, "if you would use\nthe hand of the mediciner, Dwining--he writes like a clerk.""Hath he a hint of the circumstances?"Fully," said Ramorny; and, stepping to the window, he called Dwining\nfrom the boat.He entered the presence of the Prince of Scotland, creeping as if he\ntrode upon eggs, with downcast eyes, and a frame that seemed shrunk up\nby a sense of awe produced by the occasion.I will make trial of you; thou\nknow\'st the case--place my conduct to my father in a fair light."Dwining sat down, and in a few minutes wrote a letter, which he handed\nto Sir John Ramorny."Why, the devil has aided thee, Dwining," said the knight.\'Respected father and liege sovereign--Know that important\nconsiderations induce me to take my departure from this your court,\npurposing to make my abode at Falkland, both as the seat of my dearest\nuncle Albany, with whom I know your Majesty would desire me to use all\nfamiliarity, and as the residence of one from whom I have been too\nlong estranged, and with whom I haste to exchange vows of the closest\naffection from henceforward.\'"The Duke of Rothsay and Ramorny laughed aloud; and the physician,\nwho had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death,\nencouraged by their applause, raised his eyes, uttered faintly his\nchuckling note of "He!and was again grave and silent, as if afraid\nhe had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect.The old man will apply\nall this to the Duchess, as they call her, of Rothsay.Dwining, thou\nshouldst be a secretis to his Holiness the Pope, who sometimes, it is\nsaid, wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings.I will\nsubscribe it, and have the praise of the device.""And now, my lord," said Ramorny, sealing the letter and leaving it\nbehind, "will you not to boat?""Not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries, and\nyou may call my sewer also.""My lord," said Ramorny, "time presses, and preparation will but excite\nsuspicion.Your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow.For\ntonight, I trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and\nchamber.""Nay, this time it is thou who forgets," said the Prince, touching the\nwounded arm with his walking rod."Recollect, man, thou canst neither\ncarve a capon nor tie a point--a goodly sewer or valet of the mouth!"Ramorny grinned with rage and pain; for his wound, though in a way of\nhealing, was still highly sensitive, and even the pointing a finger\ntowards it made him tremble."Will your Highness now be pleased to take boat?""Not till I take leave of the Lord Constable.Rothsay must not slip\naway, like a thief from a prison, from the house of Errol."My Lord Duke," said Ramorny, "it may be dangerous to our plan.""To the devil with danger, thy plan, and thyself!I must and will act to\nErrol as becomes us both."The earl entered, agreeable to the Prince\'s summons."I gave you this trouble, my lord," said Rothsay, with the dignified\ncourtesy which he knew so well how to assume, "to thank you for your\nhospitality and your good company.I can enjoy them no longer, as\npressing affairs call me to Falkland.""My lord," said the Lord High Constable, "I trust your Grace remembers\nthat you are--under ward."If I am a prisoner, speak plainly; if not, I will\ntake my freedom to depart.""I would, my lord, your Highness would request his Majesty\'s permission\nfor this journey."Mean you displeasure against yourself, my lord, or against me?""I have already said your Highness lies in ward here; but if you\ndetermine to break it, I have no warrant--God forbid--to put force on\nyour inclinations.I can but entreat your Highness, for your own sake--"\n\n"Of my own interest I am the best judge.The wilful Prince stepped into the boat with Dwining and Ramorny, and,\nwaiting for no other attendance, Eviot pushed off the vessel, which\ndescended the Tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the\nebb tide.For some space the Duke of Rothsay appeared silent and moody, nor did\nhis companions interrupt his reflections.He raised his head at length\nand said: "My father loves a jest, and when all is over he will take\nthis frolic at no more serious rate than it deserves--a fit of youth,\nwith which he will deal as he has with others.Yonder, my masters, shows\nthe old hold of Kinfauns, frowning above the Tay.Now, tell me, John\nRamorny, how thou hast dealt to get the Fair Maid of Perth out of the\nhands of yonder bull headed provost; for Errol told me it was rumoured\nthat she was under his protection.""Truly she was, my lord, with the purpose of being transferred to the\npatronage of the Duchess--I mean of the Lady Marjory of Douglas.Now,\nthis beetle headed provost, who is after all but a piece of blundering\nvaliancy, has, like most such, a retainer of some slyness and cunning,\nwhom he uses in all his dealings, and whose suggestions he generally\nconsiders as his own ideas.Whenever I would possess myself of a\nlandward baron, I address myself to such a confidant, who, in the\npresent case, is called Kitt Henshaw, an old skipper upon the Tay,\nand who, having in his time sailed as far as Campvere, holds with Sir\nPatrick Charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries.This his agent I have made my own, and by his means have insinuated\nvarious apologies in order to postpone the departure of Catharine for\nFalkland.""I know not if it is wise to tell your Highness, lest you should\ndisapprove of my views.I meant the officers of the Commission for\ninquiry into heretical opinions should have found the Fair Maid at\nKinfauns, for our beauty is a peevish, self willed swerver from the\nchurch; and certes, I designed that the knight should have come in\nfor his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be\ninflicted.The monks were eager enough to be at him, seeing he hath had\nfrequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe.""But wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knight\'s fortunes, and\nbrought the beautiful young woman to the stake, perchance?"An old woman\nmight have been in some danger; and as for my Lord Provost, as they call\nhim, if they had clipped off some of his fat acres, it would have\nbeen some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in St."Methinks, John, it was but a base revenge," said Rothsay.He that cannot right himself by the hand\nmust use his head.Well, that chance was over by the tender hearted\nDouglas\'s declaring in favour of tender conscience; and then, my lord,\nold Henshaw found no further objections to carrying the Fair Maid\nof Perth to Falkland, not to share the dulness of the Lady Marjory\'s\nsociety, as Sir Patrick Charteris and she herself doth opine, but to\nkeep your Highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park."There was again a long pause, in which the Prince seemed to muse deeply."Ramorny, I have a scruple in this matter; but if I\nname it to thee, the devil of sophistry, with which thou art possessed,\nwill argue it out of me, as it has done many others.This girl is the\nmost beautiful, one excepted, whom I ever saw or knew; and I like her\nthe more that she bears some features of--Elizabeth of Dunbar.But she,\nI mean Catharine Glover, is contracted, and presently to be wedded, to\nHenry the armourer, a craftsman unequalled for skill, and a man at arms\nyet unmatched in the barrace.To follow out this intrigue would do a\ngood fellow too much wrong.""Your Highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of Henry Smith\'s\ninterest," said Ramorny, looking at his wounded arm.Andrew with his shored cross, this disaster of thine is too much\nharped upon, John Ramorny!Others are content with putting a finger\ninto every man\'s pie, but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand.It is\ndone, and cannot be undone; let it be forgotten.""Nay, my lord, you allude to it more frequently than I," answered the\nknight--"in derision, it is true; while I--but I can be silent on the\nsubject if I cannot forget it.""Well, then, I tell thee that I have scruple about this intrigue.Dost\nthou remember, when we went in a frolic to hear Father Clement preach,\nor rather to see this fair heretic, that he spoke as touchingly as a\nminstrel about the rich man taking away the poor man\'s only ewe lamb?""A great matter, indeed," answered Sir John, "that this churl\'s wife\'s\neldest son should be fathered by the Prince of Scotland!How many earls\nwould covet the like fate for their fair countesses?and how many that\nhave had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it?""And if I might presume to speak," said the mediciner, "the ancient\nlaws of Scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his\nfemale vassals, though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many\nexchange it for gold.""I require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman; but this\nCatharine has been ever cold to me," said the Prince."Nay, my lord," said Ramorny, "if, young, handsome, and a prince, you\nknow not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman, it is not for\nme to say more.""And if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again, I would\nsay," quoth the leech, "that all Perth knows that the Gow Chrom never\nwas the maiden\'s choice, but fairly forced upon her by her father.I\nknow for certain that she refused him repeatedly.""Nay, if thou canst assure us of that, the case is much altered," said\nRothsay."Vulcan was a smith as well as Harry Wynd; he would needs wed\nVenus, and our chronicles tell us what came of it.""Then long may Lady Venus live and be worshipped," said Sir John\nRamorny, "and success to the gallant knight Mars who goes a-wooing to\nher goddess-ship!"The discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes; but the Duke\nof Rothsay soon dropped it."I have left," he said, "yonder air of the\nprison house behind me, and yet my spirits scarce revive.I feel that\ndrowsy, not unpleasing, yet melancholy mood that comes over us when\nexhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure.Some music now,\nstealing on the ear, yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye, were a\ntreat for the gods.""Your Grace has but to speak your wishes, and the nymphs of the Tay are\nas favourable as the fair ones upon the shore.said the Duke of Rothsay, listening; "it is, and rarely\ntouched.Steer towards the boat from\nwhence the music comes.""It is old Henshaw," said Ramorny, "working up the stream.The boatman answered the hail, and drew up alongside of the Prince\'s\nbarge.said the Prince, recognising the figure as well\nas the appointments of the French glee woman, Louise."I think I owe\nthee something for being the means of thy having a fright, at least,\nupon St.Into this boat with thee, lute, puppy dog,\nscrip and all; I will prefer thee to a lady\'s service who shall feed thy\nvery cur on capons and canary.""I trust your Highness will consider--" said Ramorny."I will consider nothing but my pleasure, John.Pray, do thou be so\ncomplying as to consider it also.""Is it indeed to a lady\'s service you would promote me?""Oh, I have heard of that great lady!"said Louise; "and will you indeed\nprefer me to your right royal consort\'s service?""I will, by my honour--whenever I receive her as such.Mark that\nreservation, John," said he aside to Ramorny.The persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings, and, concluding\na reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple,\nexhorted Louise to profit by her good fortune, and add herself to the\nDuchess of Rothsay\'s train.Several offered her some acknowledgment for\nthe exercise of her talents.During this moment of delay, Ramorny whispered to Dwining: "Make in,\nknave, with some objection.Rouse thy\nwits, while I speak a word with Henshaw.""If I might presume to speak," said Dwining, "as one who have made\nmy studies both in Spain and Arabia, I would say, my lord, that the\nsickness has appeared in Edinburgh, and that there may be risk in\nadmitting this young wanderer into your Highness\'s vicinity."and what is it to thee," said Rothsay, "whether I choose to be\npoisoned by the pestilence or the \'pothecary?Must thou, too, needs\nthwart my humour?"While the Prince thus silenced the remonstrances of Dwining, Sir John\nRamorny had snatched a moment to learn from Henshaw that the removal of\nthe Duchess of Rothsay from Falkland was still kept profoundly secret,\nand that Catharine Glover would arrive there that evening or the\nnext morning, in expectation of being taken under the noble lady\'s\nprotection.The Duke of Rothsay, deeply plunged in thought, received this intimation\nso coldly, that Ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating."This, my\nlord," he said, "is playing the spoiled child of fortune.You wish for\nliberty; it comes.You wish for beauty; it awaits you, with just so much\ndelay as to render the boon more precious.Even your slightest desires\nseem a law to the Fates; for you desire music when it seems most\ndistant, and the lute and song are at your hand.These things, so sent,\nshould be enjoyed, else we are but like petted children, who break and\nthrow from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for.""To enjoy pleasure, Ramorny," said the Prince, "a man should have\nsuffered pain, as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite.We, who\ncan have all for a wish, little enjoy that all when we have possessed\nit.Seest thou yonder thick cloud, which is about to burst to rain?It\nseems to stifle me--the waters look dark and lurid--the shores have lost\ntheir beautiful form--"\n\n"My lord, forgive your servant," said Ramorny."You indulge a powerful\nimagination, as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear\nuntil he falls back on his master and crushes him.I pray you shake off\nthis lethargy.Shall the glee maiden make some music?""Let her; but it must be melancholy: all mirth would at this moment jar\non my ear."The maiden sung a melancholy dirge in Norman French; the words, of which\nthe following is an imitation, were united to a tune as doleful as they\nare themselves:\n\n     Yes, thou mayst sigh,\n     And look once more at all around,\n     At stream and bank, and sky and ground.Thy life its final course has found,\n     And thou must die.Yes, lay thee down,\n     And while thy struggling pulses flutter,\n     Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,\n     And the deep bell its death tone utter--\n     Thy life is gone.\'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,\n     A fever fit, and then a chill,\n     And then an end of human ill,\n     For thou art dead.The Prince made no observation on the music; and the maiden, at\nRamorny\'s beck, went on from time to time with her minstrel craft, until\nthe evening sunk down into rain, first soft and gentle, at length in\ngreat quantities, and accompanied by a cold wind.There was neither\ncloak nor covering for the Prince, and he sullenly rejected that which\nRamorny offered."It is not for Rothsay to wear your cast garments, Sir John; this melted\nsnow, which I feel pierce me to the very marrow, I am now encountering\nby your fault.Why did you presume to put off the boat without my\nservants and apparel?"Ramorny did not attempt an exculpation; for he knew the Prince was in\none of those humours, when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing\nto him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology.In\nsullen silence, or amid unsuppressed chiding, the boat arrived at the\nfishing village of Newburgh.The party landed, and found horses in\nreadiness, which, indeed, Ramorny had long since provided for the\noccasion.Their quality underwent the Prince\'s bitter sarcasm, expressed\nto Ramorny sometimes by direct words, oftener by bitter gibes.At length\nthey were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling\nrain, the Prince leading the way with reckless haste.The glee maiden,\nmounted by his express order, attended them and well for her that,\naccustomed to severe weather, and exercise both on foot and horseback,\nshe supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride.Ramorny was compelled to keep at the Prince\'s rein, being under no small\nanxiety lest, in his wayward fit, he might ride off from him entirely,\nand, taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron, escape the snare\nwhich was spread for him.He therefore suffered inexpressibly during the\nride, both in mind and in body.At length the forest of Falkland received them, and a glimpse of the\nmoon showed the dark and huge tower, an appendage of royalty itself,\nthough granted for a season to the Duke of Albany.On a signal given the\ndrawbridge fell.Torches glared in the courtyard, menials attended,\nand the Prince, assisted from horseback, was ushered into an apartment,\nwhere Ramorny waited on him, together with Dwining, and entreated him\nto take the leech\'s advice.The Duke of Rothsay repulsed the proposal,\nhaughtily ordered his bed to be prepared, and having stood for some time\nshivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire, he retired\nto his apartment without taking leave of anyone."You see the peevish humour of this childish boy, now," said Ramorny to\nDwining; "can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as\nI have should be tired of such a master?""No, truly," said Dwining, "that and the promised earldom of Lindores\nwould shake any man\'s fidelity.But shall we commence with him this\nevening?He has, if eye and cheek speak true, the foundation of a fever\nwithin him, which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect\nof nature.""It is an opportunity lost," said Ramorny; "but we must delay our blow\ntill he has seen this beauty, Catharine Glover.She may be hereafter a\nwitness that she saw him in good health, and master of his own motions,\na brief space before--you understand me?"Dwining nodded assent, and added:\n\n"There is no time lost; for there is little difficulty in blighting a\nflower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon."in sooth he was a shameless wight,\n     Sore given to revel and ungodly glee:\n     Few earthly things found favour in his sight,\n     Save concubines and carnal companie,\n     And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.With the next morning the humour of the Duke of Rothsay was changed.He complained, indeed, of pain and fever, but they rather seemed to\nstimulate than to overwhelm him.He was familiar with Ramorny, and\nthough he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night, it was\nplain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his\nfollowers--the ill humour he had then displayed.He was civil to every\none, and jested with Ramorny on the subject of Catharine\'s arrival."How surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family\nof men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners\nof Dame Marjory\'s waiting women!Thou hast not many of the tender sex in\nthy household, I take it, Ramorny?""Faith, none except the minstrel wench, but a household drudge or two\nwhom we may not dispense with.By the way, she is anxiously inquiring\nafter the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.Shall I\ndismiss her, to hunt for her new mistress at leisure?""By no means, she will serve to amuse Catharine.And, hark you, were it\nnot well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming?"We will not disappoint her, since she expects\nto find the Duchess of Rothsay: I will be Duke and Duchess in my own\nperson.""No one so dull as a wit," said the Prince, "when he does not hit off\nthe scent at once.My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a\nhurry to run away from Falkland as I to come hither.There is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe\nadjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival.Look you,\nI will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a mourning\nveil and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John,\nwilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour,\nthe Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her\nnurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his\nwhole face, and skull to boot.He should have the commodity of a beard\nto set her forth conformably.Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable\npages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom.Ramorny hasted into the anteroom, and told Dwining the Prince\'s device."Do thou look to humour the fool," he said; "I care not how little I see\nhim, knowing what is to be done.""Trust all to me," said the physician, shrugging his shoulders."What\nsort of a butcher is he that can cut the lamb\'s throat, yet is afraid to\nhear it bleat?""Tush, fear not my constancy: I cannot forget that he would have cast\nme into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the\ntruncheon of a broken lance.Begone--yet stay; ere you go to arrange\nthis silly pageant, something must be settled to impose on the thick\nwitted Charteris.He is like enough, should he be left in the belief\nthat the Duchess of Rothsay is still here, and Catharine Glover in\nattendance on her, to come down with offers of service, and the like,\nwhen, as I need scarce tell thee, his presence would be inconvenient.Indeed, this is the more likely, that some folks have given a warmer\nname to the iron headed knight\'s great and tender patronage of this\ndamsel.""With that hint, let me alone to deal with him.I will send him such a\nletter, that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey\nto hell as to Falkland.Can you tell me the name of the Duchess\'s\nconfessor?""Waltheof, a grey friar."In a few minutes, for he was a clerk of rare celerity, Dwining finished\na letter, which he placed in Ramorny\'s hand."This is admirable, and would have made thy fortune with Rothsay.I\nthink I should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household,\nsave that his day is closed.""Read it aloud," said Dwining, "that we may judge if it goes trippingly\noff."And Ramorny read as follows: "By command of our high and mighty Princess\nMarjory, Duchess of Rothsay, and so forth, we Waltheof, unworthy brother\nof the order of St.Francis, do thee, Sir Patrick Charteris, knight of\nKinfauns, to know, that her Highness marvels much at the temerity with\nwhich you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge\nbut lightly, seeing she hath made her abode, without any necessity,\nfor more than a week in thine own castle, without company of any other\nfemale, saving menials; of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone\nup through Fife, Angus, and Perthshire.Nevertheless, her Highness,\nconsidering the ease as one of human frailty, hath not caused this\nwanton one to be scourged with nettles, or otherwise to dree penance;\nbut, as two good brethren of the convent of Lindores, the Fathers\nThickskull and Dundermore, have been summoned up to the Highlands upon\nan especial call, her Highness hath committed to their care this maiden\nCatharine, with charge to convey her to her father, whom she states\nto be residing beside Loch Tay, under whose protection she will find\na situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the Castle of\nFalkland, while her Highness the Duchess of Rothsay abides there.She\nhath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman\nas may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence, and she commendeth\nthee to confession and penitence.--Signed, Waltheof, by command of an\nhigh and mighty Princess"; and so forth.When he had finished, "Excellent--excellent!""This\nunexpected rebuff will drive Charteris mad!He hath been long making\na sort of homage to this lady, and to find himself suspected of\nincontinence, when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable\naction, will altogether confound him; and, as thou say\'st, it will be\nlong enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour\nto the dame.But away to thy pageant, while I prepare that which shall\nclose the pageant for ever."It was an hour before noon, when Catharine, escorted by old Henshaw and\na groom of the Knight of Kinfauns, arrived before the lordly tower of\nFalkland.The broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms\nof Rothsay, the servants who appeared wore the colours of the Prince\'s\nhousehold, all confirming the general belief that the Duchess still\nresided there.Catharine\'s heart throbbed, for she had heard that\nthe Duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house\nof Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to\nexperience.On entering the castle, she observed that the train was\nsmaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close\nretirement, she was little surprised at this.In a species of anteroom\nshe was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and\nsupported herself upon an ebony staff."Truly thou art welcome, fair daughter," said she, saluting Catharine,\n"and, as I may say, to an afflicted house; and I trust (once more\nsaluting her) thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal\ndaughter the Duchess.Sit thee down, my child, till I see whether my\nlady be at leisure to receive thee.Ah, my child, thou art very lovely\nindeed, if Our Lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a\nbody."With that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment,\nwhere she found Rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared, and\nRamorny, who had evaded taking part in the pageant, in his ordinary\nattire."Thou art a precious rascal, sir doctor," said the Prince; "by my\nhonour, I think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole\nplay thyself, lover\'s part and all.""If it were to save your Highness trouble," said the leech, with his\nusual subdued laugh."No--no," said Rothsay, "I never need thy help, man; and tell me now,\nhow look I, thus disposed on the couch--languishing and ladylike, ha?""Something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the Lady Marjory\nof Douglas, if I may presume to say so," said the leech."Away, villain, and marshal in this fair frost piece--fear not she will\ncomplain of my effeminacy; and thou, Ramorny, away also."As the knight left the apartment by one door, the fictitious old woman\nushered in Catharine Glover by another.The room had been carefully\ndarkened to twilight, so that Catharine saw the apparently female figure\nstretched on the couch without the least suspicion.asked Rothsay, in a voice naturally sweet, and now\ncarefully modulated to a whispering tone."Let her approach, Griselda,\nand kiss our hand."The supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the\ncouch, and signed to her to kneel.Catharine did so, and kissed with\nmuch devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit\nduchess extended to her."Be not afraid," said the same musical voice; "in me you only see a\nmelancholy example of the vanity of human greatness; happy those, my\nchild, whose rank places them beneath the storms of state."While he spoke, he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards\nhim, as if to salute her in token of welcome.But the kiss was bestowed\nwith an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair\npatroness, that Catharine, concluding the Duchess had lost her senses,\nscreamed aloud.Catharine looked around her; the nurse was gone, and the Duke tearing\noff his veil, she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine.she said; "and Thou wilt, if I forsake\nnot myself."As this resolution darted through her mind, she repressed her\ndisposition to scream, and, as far as she might, strove to conceal her\nfear."The jest hath been played," she said, with as much firmness as she\ncould assume; "may I entreat that your Highness will now unhand me?"for\nhe still kept hold of her arm."Nay, my pretty captive, struggle not--why should you fear?"As you are pleased to detain me, I will\nnot, by striving, provoke you to use me ill, and give pain to yourself,\nwhen you have time to think.""Why, thou traitress, thou hast held me captive for months," said the\nPrince, "and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment?""This were gallantry, my lord, were it in the streets of Perth, where I\nmight listen or escape as I listed; it is tyranny here.""And if I did let thee go, whither wouldst thou fly?""The bridges are up, the portcullis down, and the men who follow me are\nstrangely deaf to a peevish maiden\'s squalls.Be kind, therefore, and\nyou shall know what it is to oblige a prince.""Unloose me, then, my lord, and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself,\nfrom Rothsay to the Prince of Scotland.I am the daughter of an humble\nbut honest citizen.I am, I may well nigh say, the spouse of a brave and\nhonest man.If I have given your Highness any encouragement for what you\nhave done, it has been unintentional.Thus forewarned, I entreat you to\nforego your power over me, and suffer me to depart.Your Highness can\nobtain nothing from me, save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or\nmanhood.""You are bold, Catharine," said the Prince, "but neither as a knight\nnor a man can I avoid accepting a defiance.I must teach you the risk of\nsuch challenges."While he spoke, he attempted to throw his arms again around her; but she\neluded his grasp, and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision."My strength, my lord, is as great to defend myself in an honourable\nstrife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose.Do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat.You may stun\nme with blows, or you may call aid to overpower me; but otherwise you\nwill fail of your purpose.""The force I would\nuse is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness.""Then keep it," said Catharine, "for those women who desire such an\nexcuse.My resistance is that of the most determined mind which love\nof honour and fear of shame ever inspired.my lord, could you\nsucceed, you would but break every bond between me and life, between\nyourself and honour.I have been trained fraudulently here, by what\ndecoys I know not; but were I to go dishonoured hence, it would be to\ndenounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of Europe.I would take the palmer\'s staff in my hand, and wherever chivalry is\nhonoured, or the word Scotland has been heard, I would proclaim the heir\nof a hundred kings, the son of the godly Robert Stuart, the heir of\nthe heroic Bruce, a truthless, faithless man, unworthy of the crown he\nexpects and of the spurs he wears.Every lady in wide Europe would hold\nyour name too foul for her lips; every worthy knight would hold you\na baffled, forsworn caitiff, false to the first vow of arms, the\nprotection of woman and the defence of the feeble."Rothsay resumed his seat, and looked at her with a countenance in which\nresentment was mingled with admiration."You forget to whom you speak,\nmaiden.Know, the distinction I have offered you is one for which\nhundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude.""Once more, my lord," resumed Catharine, "keep these favours for those\nby whom they are prized; or rather reserve your time and your health\nfor other and nobler pursuits--for the defence of your country and\nthe happiness of your subjects.Alas, my lord, how willingly would an\nexulting people receive you for their chief!How gladly would they close\naround you, did you show desire to head them against the oppression of\nthe mighty, the violence of the lawless, the seduction of the vicious,\nand the tyranny of the hypocrite!"The Duke of Rothsay, whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited\nas they were evanescent, was affected by the enthusiasm with which she\nspoke."Forgive me if I have alarmed you, maiden," he said "thou art\ntoo noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure, for which my mistake\ndestined thee; and I, even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and\ntranscendent beauty, have no heart to give thee; for by the homage of\nthe heart only should such as thou be wooed.But my hopes have been\nblighted, Catharine: the only woman I ever loved has been torn from me\nin the very wantonness of policy, and a wife imposed on me whom I must\never detest, even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can\nrender a woman amiable in my eyes.My health is fading even in early\nyouth; and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the\nshort passage from life to the grave will now present.Look at my hectic\ncheek; feel, if you will, my intermitting pulse; and pity me and excuse\nme if I, whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon\nand usurped, feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others,\nand indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment."exclaimed Catharine, with the enthusiasm which belonged\nto her character--"I will call you my dear lord, for dear must the heir\nof Bruce be to every child of Scotland--let me not, I pray, hear you\nspeak thus!Your glorious ancestor endured exile, persecution, the night\nof famine, and the day of unequal combat, to free his country; do you\npractise the like self denial to free yourself.Tear yourself from those\nwho find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies.You know it not, I am sure--you could not\nknow; but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by\nthreatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile,\nall that is treacherous!""He did indeed, my lord, and he dares not deny it.""It shall be looked to," answered the Duke of Rothsay."I have ceased\nto love him; but he has suffered much for my sake, and I must see his\nservices honourably requited."Oh, my lord, if chronicles speak true, such services\nbrought Troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of Spain.""Hush, maiden--speak within compass, I pray you," said the Prince,\nrising up; "our conference ends here.""Yet one word, my Lord Duke of Rothsay," said Catharine, with animation,\nwhile her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel."I cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly; but the fire burns\nwithin me, and will break out.Leave this castle without an hour\'s\ndelay; the air is unwholesome for you.Dismiss this Ramorny before the\nday is ten minutes older; his company is most dangerous.""None in especial," answered Catharine, abashed at her own\neagerness--"none, perhaps, excepting my fears for your safety.""To vague fears the heir of Bruce must not listen.Ramorny entered, and bowed low to the Duke and to the maiden, whom,\nperhaps, he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of\nfavourite sultana, and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance."Ramorny," said the Prince, "is there in the household any female of\nreputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her\nwhere she may desire to go?""I fear," replied Ramorny, "if it displease not your Highness to hear\nthe truth, your household is indifferently provided in that way; and\nthat, to speak the very verity, the glee maiden is the most decorous\namongst us.""Let her wait upon this young person, then, since better may not be.And\ntake patience, maiden, for a few hours.""So, my lord, part you so soon from the Fair Maid of Perth?This is,\nindeed, the very wantonness of victory.""There is neither victory nor defeat in the case," returned the Prince,\ndrily."The girl loves me not; nor do I love her well enough to torment\nmyself concerning her scruples.""The chaste Malcolm the Maiden revived in one of his descendants!""Favour me, sir, by a truce to your wit, or by choosing a different\nsubject for its career.It is noon, I believe, and you will oblige me by\ncommanding them to serve up dinner."Ramorny left the room; but Rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon\nhis countenance, and to be the subject of this man\'s satire gave him no\nordinary degree of pain.He summoned, however, the knight to his table,\nand even admitted Dwining to the same honour.The conversation was of\na lively and dissolute cast, a tone encouraged by the Prince, as if\ndesigning to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning,\nwhich Ramorny, who was read in old chronicles, had the boldness to liken\nto the continence of Scipio.The banquet, nothwithstanding the Duke\'s indifferent health, was\nprotracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance; and,\nwhether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank, or the\nweakness of his constitution, or, as it is probable, because the last\nwine which he quaffed had been adulterated by Dwining, it so happened\nthat the Prince, towards the end of the repast, fell into a lethargic\nsleep, from which it seemed impossible to rouse him.Sir John Ramorny\nand Dwining carried him to his chamber, accepting no other assistance\nthan that of another person, whom we will afterwards give name to.Next morning, it was announced that the Prince was taken ill of\nan infectious disorder; and, to prevent its spreading through the\nhousehold, no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of\nhorse, the physician Dwining, and the domestic already mentioned; one of\nwhom seemed always to remain in the apartment, while the others observed\na degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the\nfamily, so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill\nof an infectious disorder.In winter\'s tedious nights, sit by the fire,\n     With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales\n     Of woeful ages, long ago betid:\n     And, ere thou bid goodnight, to quit their grief,\n     Tell thou the lamentable fall of me.King Richard II Act V. Scene I.\n\n\nFar different had been the fate of the misguided heir of Scotland from\nthat which was publicly given out in the town of Falkland.His ambitious\nuncle had determined on his death, as the means of removing the first\nand most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne.James, the younger son of the King, was a mere boy, who might at more\nleisure be easily set aside.Ramorny\'s views of aggrandisement, and the\nresentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made\nhim a willing agent in young Rothsay\'s destruction.Dwining\'s love of\ngold, and his native malignity of disposition, rendered him equally\nforward.It had been resolved, with the most calculating cruelty,\nthat all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be\ncarefully avoided, and the extinction of life suffered to take place\nof itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired\nconstitution.The Prince of Scotland was not to be murdered, as Ramorny\nhad expressed himself on another occasion, he was only to cease to\nexist.Rothsay\'s bedchamber in the Tower of Falkland was well adapted\nfor the execution of such a horrible project.A small, narrow staircase,\nscarce known to exist, opened from thence by a trapdoor to the\nsubterranean dungeons of the castle, through a passage by which\nthe feudal lord was wont to visit, in private and in disguise, the\ninhabitants of those miserable regions.By this staircase the villains\nconveyed the insensible Prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle,\nso deep in the bowels of the earth, that no cries or groans, it was\nsupposed, could possibly be heard, while the strength of its door and\nfastenings must for a long time have defied force, even if the entrance\ncould have been discovered.Bonthron, who had been saved from the\ngallows for the purpose, was the willing agent of Ramorny\'s unparalleled\ncruelty to his misled and betrayed patron.This wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the Prince\'s lethargy\nbegan to wear off, and when, awaking to sensation, he felt himself\ndeadly cold, unable to move, and oppressed with fetters, which scarce\npermitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid.His\nfirst idea was that he was in a fearful dream, his next brought a\nconfused augury of the truth.He called, shouted, yelled at length in\nfrenzy but no assistance came, and he was only answered by the vaulted\nroof of the dungeon.The agent of hell heard these agonizing screams,\nand deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with\nwhich Rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him.When,\nexhausted and hopeless, the unhappy youth remained silent, the savage\nresolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner.The locks\nwere drawn, the chain fell; the Prince raised himself as high as his\nfetters permitted; a red glare, against which he was fain to shut his\neyes, streamed through the vault; and when he opened them again, it was\non the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead."I am judged and condemned," he exclaimed, "and the most abhorred fiend\nin the infernal regions is sent to torment me!""I live, my lord," said Bonthron; "and that you may live and enjoy life,\nbe pleased to sit up and eat your victuals.""Free me from these irons," said the Prince, "release me from this\ndungeon, and, dog as thou art, thou shalt be the richest man in\nScotland.""If you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold," said\nBonthron, "I would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure\nmyself!But look up; you were wont to love delicate fare--behold how I\nhave catered for you."The wretch, with fiendish glee, unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the\nbundle which he bore under\' his arm, and, passing the light to and fro\nbefore it, showed the unhappy Prince a bull\'s head recently hewn from\nthe trunk, and known in Scotland as the certain signal of death.He\nplaced it at the foot of the bed, or rather lair, on which the Prince\nlay."Be moderate in your food," he said; "it is like to be long ere thou\ngetst another meal.""Tell me but one thing, wretch," said the Prince."Does Ramorny know of\nthis practice?""How else hadst thou been decoyed hither?Poor woodcock, thou art\nsnared!"With these words, the door shut, the bolts resounded, and the unhappy\nPrince was left to darkness, solitude, and misery."Oh, my father!--my\nprophetic father!The staff I leaned on has indeed proved a spear!"We will not dwell on the subsequent hours, nay, days, of bodily agony\nand mental despair.But it was not the pleasure of Heaven that so great a crime should be\nperpetrated with impunity.Catharine Glover and the glee woman, neglected by the other inmates,\nwho seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the Prince\'s illness, were,\nhowever, refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen\nhow this alarming disease was to terminate, and whether it was actually\nan infectious sickness.Forced on each other\'s society, the two desolate\nwomen became companions, if not friends; and the union drew somewhat\ncloser when Catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel\non whose account Henry Wynd had fallen under her displeasure.She now\nheard his complete vindication, and listened with ardour to the praises\nwhich Louise heaped on her gallant protector.On the other hand, the\nminstrel, who felt the superiority of Catharine\'s station and character,\nwillingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her, and recorded\nher gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of "Bold and True,"\nwhich was long a favourite in Scotland.Oh, bold and true,\n     In bonnet blue,\n     That fear or falsehood never knew,\n     Whose heart was loyal to his word,\n     Whose hand was faithful to his sword--\n     Seek Europe wide from sea to sea,\n     But bonny blue cap still for me!I\'ve seen Almain\'s proud champions prance,\n     Have seen the gallant knights of France,\n     Unrivall\'d with the sword and lance,\n     Have seen the sons of England true,\n     Wield the brown bill and bend the yew.Search France the fair, and England free,\n     But bonny blue cap still for me!In short, though Louise\'s disreputable occupation would have been in\nother circumstances an objection to Catharine\'s voluntarily frequenting\nher company, yet, forced together as they now were, she found her a\nhumble and accommodating companion.They lived in this manner for four or five days, and, in order to avoid\nas much as possible the gaze, and perhaps the incivility, of the menials\nin the offices, they prepared their food in their own apartment.In the\nabsolutely necessary intercourse with domestics, Louise, more accustomed\nto expedients, bolder by habit, and desirous to please Catharine,\nwillingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the\nmaterials of their slender meal, and of arranging it with the dexterity\nof her country.The glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day, a\nlittle before noon; and the desire of fresh air, or the hope to find\nsome sallad or pot herbs, or at least an early flower or two, with which\nto deck their board, had carried her into the small garden appertaining\nto the castle.She re-entered her apartment in the tower with a\ncountenance pale as ashes, and a frame which trembled like an aspen\nleaf.Her terror instantly extended itself to Catharine, who could\nhardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred.said Louise, speaking under her breath, and huddling\nher words so thick upon each other that Catharine could hardly catch\nthe sense."I was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage, because\nyou said you loved them yesterday; my poor little dog, thrusting himself\ninto a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins\nclose to the castle wall, came back whining and howling.I crept forward\nto see what might be the cause--and, oh!I heard a groaning as of one\nin extreme pain, but so faint, that it seemed to arise out of the very\ndepth of the earth.At length, I found it proceeded from a small rent in\nthe wall, covered with ivy; and when I laid my ear close to the opening,\nI could hear the Prince\'s voice distinctly say, \'It cannot now last\nlong\'--and then it sunk away in something like a prayer.""I said, \'Is it you, my lord?\'and the answer was, \'Who mocks me with\nthat title?\'I asked him if I could help him, and he answered with a\nvoice I shall never forget, \'Food--food!So I came\nhither to tell you.that were more likely to destroy than to aid," said Catharine."I know not yet," said Catharine, prompt and bold on occasions of\nmoment, though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on\nordinary occasions: "I know not yet, but something we will do: the blood\nof Bruce shall not die unaided."So saying, she seized the small cruise which contained their soup, and\nthe meat of which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had\nbaked into the fold of her plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow\nwith a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened\ntowards the garden."So, our fair vestal is stirring abroad?"said the only man she met, who\nwas one of the menials; but Catharine passed on without notice or reply,\nand gained the little garden without farther interruption.Louise indicated to her a heap of ruins, which, covered with underwood,\nwas close to the castle wall.It had probably been originally a\nprojection from the building; and the small fissure, which communicated\nwith the dungeon, contrived for air, had terminated within it.But the\naperture had been a little enlarged by decay, and admitted a dim ray of\nlight to its recesses, although it could not be observed by those who\nvisited the place with torchlight aids."Here is dead silence," said Catharine, after she had listened\nattentively for a moment."Heaven and earth, he is gone!""We must risk something," said her companion, and ran her fingers over\nthe strings of her guitar.A sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon."I am here, my lord--I am here, with food and drink."The jest comes too late; I am dying," was the answer."His brain is turned, and no wonder," thought Catharine; "but whilst\nthere is life, there may be hope.""It is I, my lord, Catharine Glover.I have food, if I could pass it\nsafely to you."I thought the pain was over, but it glows\nagain within me at the name of food.""The food is here, but how--ah, how can I pass it to you?the chink\nis so narrow, the wall is so thick!Yet there is a remedy--I have it.Quick, Louise; cut me a willow bough, the tallest you can find."The glee maiden obeyed, and, by means of a cleft in the top of the\nwand, Catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes, soaked in\nbroth, which served at once for food and for drink.The unfortunate young man ate little, and with difficulty, but prayed\nfor a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter."I had destined\nthee to be the slave of my vices," he said, "and yet thou triest to\nbecome the preserver of my life!"I will return with food as I shall see opportunity," said Catharine,\njust as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent\nand stand close.Both crouched among the ruins, and they heard the voices of Ramorny and\nthe mediciner in close conversation."He is stronger than I thought," said the former, in a low, croaking\ntone."How long held out Dalwolsy, when the knight of Liddesdale\nprisoned him in his castle of Hermitage?""For a fortnight," answered Dwining; "but he was a strong man, and had\nsome assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison\nhouse.""Were it not better end the matter more speedily?He will demand to see the\nPrince, and all must be over ere he comes."They passed on in their dark and fatal conversation."Now gain we the tower," said Catharine to her companion, when she saw\nthey had left the garden."I had a plan of escape for myself; I will\nturn it into one of rescue for the Prince.The dey woman enters the\ncastle about vesper time, and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as\nshe goes into the pantlers\' office with the milk.Take thou the cloak,\nmuffle thyself close, and pass the warder boldly; he is usually drunken\nat that hour, and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through\ngate and along bridge, if thou bear thyself with confidence.Then away\nto meet the Black Douglas; he is our nearest and only aid.""But," said Louise, "is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with\nshame and punishment?""Believe it," said Catharine, "such as thou or I never dwelt an hour in\nthe Douglas\'s memory, either for good or evil.Tell him that his son in\nlaw, the Prince of Scotland dies--treacherously famished--in Falkland\nCastle, and thou wilt merit not pardon only, but reward.""I care not for reward," said Louise; "the deed will reward itself.But\nmethinks to stay is more dangerous than to go.Let me stay, then, and\nnourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help.If they\nkill me before you return, I leave you my poor lute, and pray you to be\nkind to my poor Charlot.""No, Louise," replied Catharine, "you are a more privileged and\nexperienced wanderer than I--do you go; and if you find me dead on your\nreturn, as may well chance, give my poor father this ring and a lock of\nmy hair, and say, Catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of\nBruce.And give this other lock to Henry; say, Catharine thought of him\nto the last, and that, if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the\nblood of others, he will then know it was not because she valued her\nown."They sobbed in each other\'s arms, and the intervening hours till evening\nwere spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the\ncaptive with nourishment, and in the construction of a tube, composed\nof hollow reeds, slipping into each other, by which liquids might be\nconveyed to him.The bell of the village church of Falkland tolled to\nvespers.The dey, or farm woman, entered with her pitchers to deliver\nthe milk for the family, and to hear and tell the news stirring.She had\nscarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel, again throwing\nherself in Catharine\'s arms, and assuring her of her unalterable\nfidelity, crept in silence downstairs, the little dog under her arm.A\nmoment after, she was seen by the breathless Catharine, wrapt in the dey\nwoman\'s cloak, and walking composedly across the drawbridge."So," said the warder, "you return early tonight, May Bridget?Small\nmirth towards in the hall--ha, wench!"I have forgotten my tallies," said the ready witted French woman, "and\nwill return in the skimming of a bowie."She went onward, avoiding the village of Falkland, and took a footpath\nwhich led through the park.Catharine breathed freely, and blessed God\nwhen she saw her lost in the distance.It was another anxious hour\nfor Catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was\ndiscovered.This happened so soon as the dey girl, having taken an hour\nto perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished, was about\nto return, and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze\ncloak.A strict search was set on foot; at length the women of the\nhouse remembered the glee maiden, and ventured to suggest her as one not\nunlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one.The warder, strictly\nquestioned, averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after\nvespers; and on this being contradicted by the party herself, he could\nsuggest, as the only alternative, that it must needs have been the\ndevil.As, however, the glee woman could not be found, the real circumstances\nof the case were easily guessed at; and the steward went to inform Sir\nJohn Ramorny and Dwining, who were now scarcely ever separate, of\nthe escape of one of their female captives.Everything awakens the\nsuspicions of the guilty.They looked on each other with faces of\ndismay, and then went together to the humble apartment of Catharine,\nthat they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they\ninquired into the facts attending Louise\'s disappearance.said Ramorny, in a tone of\naustere gravity."I have no companion here," answered Catharine."Trifle not," replied the knight; "I mean the glee maiden, who lately\ndwelt in this chamber with you.""She is gone, they tell me," said Catharine--"gone about an hour since.""How," answered Catharine, "should I know which way a professed wanderer\nmay choose to travel?She was tired no doubt of a solitary life, so\ndifferent from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads\nher to frequent.She is gone, and the only wonder is that she should\nhave stayed so long.""This, then," said Ramorny, "is all you have to tell us?""All that I have to tell you, Sir John," answered Catharine, firmly;\n"and if the Prince himself inquire, I can tell him no more.""There is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to\nyou in person," said Ramorny, "even if Scotland should escape being\nrendered miserable by the sad event of his decease.""Is the Duke of Rothsay so very ill?""No help, save in Heaven," answered Ramorny, looking upward."Then may there yet be help there," said Catharine, "if human aid prove\nunavailing!"said Ramorny, with the most determined gravity; while Dwining\nadopted a face fit to echo the feeling, though it seemed to cost him\na painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph,\nwhich was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency."And it is men--earthly men, and not incarnate devils, who thus appeal\nto Heaven, while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their\nhapless master!"muttered Catharine, as her two baffled inquisitors left\nthe apartment.But it will roll ere long, and\noh!may it be to preserve as well as to punish!"The hour of dinner alone afforded a space when, all in the castle being\noccupied with that meal, Catharine thought she had the best opportunity\nof venturing to the breach in the wall, with the least chance of being\nobserved.In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle,\nwhich had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke\nof Rothsay.The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of\nthe machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms\nwent out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam.She\nobserved, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window\nwere in arms.All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the\napproach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more\nlonely than ever.At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care\nto provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed\ndisposed to indulge, such articles of food as could be the most easily\nconveyed to the unhappy captive.She whispered to intimate her presence;\nthere was no answer; she spoke louder, still there was silence."He sleeps," she muttered these words half aloud, and with a shuddering\nwhich was succeeded by a start and a scream, when a voice replied behind\nher:\n\n"Yes, he sleeps; but it is for ever."Sir John Ramorny stood behind her in complete armour,\nbut the visor of his helmet was up, and displayed a countenance more\nresembling one about to die than to fight.He spoke with a grave tone,\nsomething between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of\none who is an agent and partaker in it."Catharine," he said, "all is true which I tell you.You\nhave done your best for him; you can do no more.""I will not--I cannot believe it," said Catharine."Heaven be merciful\nto me!it would make one doubt of Providence, to think so great a crime\nhas been accomplished.""Doubt not of Providence, Catharine, though it has suffered the\nprofligate to fall by his own devices.Follow me; I have that to say\nwhich concerns you.I say follow (for she hesitated), unless you prefer\nbeing left to the mercies of the brute Bonthron and the mediciner\nHenbane Dwining.""I will follow you," said Catharine."You cannot do more to me than you\nare permitted."He led the way into the tower, and mounted staircase after staircase and\nladder after ladder."I will follow no farther," she said.If to my death, I can die here.""Only to the battlements of the castle, fool," said Ramorny, throwing\nwide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle,\nwhere men were bending mangonels, as they called them (military engines,\nthat is, for throwing arrows or stones), getting ready crossbows, and\npiling stones together.But the defenders did not exceed twenty in\nnumber, and Catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution\namongst them."Catharine," said Ramorny, "I must not quit this station, which is\nnecessary for my defence; but I can speak with you here as well as\nelsewhere.""Say on," answered Catharine, "I am prepared to hear you.""You have thrust yourself, Catharine, into a bloody secret.Have you the\nfirmness to keep it?""I do not understand you, Sir John," answered the maiden.I have slain--murdered, if you will--my late master, the Duke\nof Rothsay.The spark of life which your kindness would have fed\nwas easily smothered.You are\nfaint--bear up--you have more to hear.You know the crime, but you know\nnot the provocation.this gauntlet is empty; I lost my right hand\nin his cause, and when I was no longer fit to serve him, I was cast off\nlike a worn out hound, my loss ridiculed, and a cloister recommended,\ninstead of the halls and palaces in which I had my natural sphere!Think\non this--pity and assist me.""In what manner can you require my assistance?"said the trembling\nmaiden; "I can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime.""Thou canst be silent, Catharine, on what thou hast seen and heard in\nyonder thicket.It is but a brief oblivion I ask of you, whose word\nwill, I know, be listened to, whether you say such things were or were\nnot.That of your mountebank companion, the foreigner, none will hold\nto be of a pin point\'s value.If you grant me this, I will take your\npromise for my security, and throw the gate open to those who now\napproach it.If you will not promise silence, I defend this castle till\nevery one perishes, and I fling you headlong from these battlements.Ay, look at them--it is not a leap to be rashly braved.Seven courses of\nstairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath; but you\nshall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe\na sigh!Speak the word, fair maid; for you speak to one unwilling to\nharm you, but determined in his purpose."Catharine stood terrified, and without power of answering a man who\nseemed so desperate; but she was saved the necessity of reply by the\napproach of Dwining.He spoke with the same humble conges which at all\ntimes distinguished his manner, and with his usual suppressed ironical\nsneer, which gave that manner the lie."I do you wrong, noble sir, to intrude on your valiancie when engaged\nwith a fair damsel.But I come to ask a trifling question."said Ramorny; "ill news are sport to thee even when\nthey affect thyself, so that they concern others also.""Hem!--he, he!--I only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the\nchivalrous task of defending the castle with your single hand--I crave\npardon, I meant your single arm?The question is worth asking, for I\nam good for little to aid the defence, unless you could prevail on the\nbesiegers to take physic--he, he, he!--and Bonthron is as drunk as ale\nand strong waters can make him; and you, he, and I make up the whole\ngarrison who are disposed for resistance.""Never saw men who showed less stomach to the work," answered\nDwining--"never.Eviot and his companion Buncle now approached, with sullen resolution\nin their faces, like men who had made their minds up to resist that\nauthority which they had so long obeyed.said Ramorny, stepping forward to meet them.Why have you left the barbican, Eviot?And you other fellow,\ndid I not charge you to look to the mangonels?""We have something to tell you, Sir John Ramorny," answered Eviot."We\nwill not fight in this quarrel.""How--my own squires control me?""We were your squires and pages, my lord, while you were master of the\nDuke of Rothsay\'s household.It is bruited about the Duke no longer\nlives; we desire to know the truth.""What traitor dares spread such falsehoods?""All who have gone out to skirt the forest, my lord, and I myself among\nothers, bring back the same news.The minstrel woman who left the castle\nyesterday has spread the report everywhere that the Duke of Rothsay\nis murdered, or at death\'s door.The Douglas comes on us with a strong\nforce--"\n\n"And you, cowards, take advantage of an idle report to forsake your\nmaster?""My lord," said Eviot, "let Buncle and myself see the Duke of Rothsay,\nand receive his personal orders for defence of this castle, and if we do\nnot fight to the death in that quarrel, I will consent to be hanged on\nits highest turret.But if he be gone by natural disease, we will yield\nup the castle to the Earl of Douglas, who is, they say, the King\'s\nlieutenant.Or if--which Heaven forefend!--the noble Prince has had\nfoul play, we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in\ndefence of the murderers, be they who they will.""Eviot," said Ramorny, raising his mutilated arm, "had not that glove\nbeen empty, thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence.""It is as it is," answered Evict, "and we do but our duty.I have\nfollowed you long, my lord, but here I draw bridle.""Farewell, then, and a curse light on all of you!""Our valiancie is about to run away," said the mediciner, who had crept\nclose to Catharine\'s side before she was aware."Catharine, thou art a\nsuperstitious fool, like most women; nevertheless thou hast some mind,\nand I speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes\nwhich are herding about us.These haughty barons who overstride the\nworld, what are they in the day of adversity?Let\ntheir sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury,\nand bah!Heart and courage is nothing to\nthem, lith and limb everything: give them animal strength, what are they\nbetter than furious bulls; take that away, and your hero of chivalry\nlies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung.Not so the sage;\nwhile a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame, his mind\nshall be strong as ever.Catharine, this morning I was practising your\ndeath; but methinks I now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the\npoor mediciner, the pill gilder, the mortar pounder, the poison vender,\nmet his fate, in company with the gallant Knight of Ramorny, Baron in\npossession and Earl of Lindores in expectation--God save his lordship!""Old man," said Catharine, "if thou be indeed so near the day of thy\ndeserved doom, other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious\nravings of a vain philosophy.Ask to see a holy man--"\n\n"Yes," said Dwining, scornfully, "refer myself to a greasy monk, who\ndoes not--he!he!--understand the barbarous Latin he repeats by\nrote.Such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both\nin Spain and Arabia!No, Catharine, I will choose a confessor that is\npleasant to look upon, and you shall be honoured with the office.Now,\nlook yonder at his valiancie, his eyebrow drops with moisture, his lip\ntrembles with agony; for his valiancie--he!he!--is pleading for his\nlife with his late domestics, and has not eloquence enough to persuade\nthem to let him slip.See how the fibres of his face work as he implores\nthe ungrateful brutes, whom he has heaped with obligations, to permit\nhim to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds\nwhen men course her fairly.Look also at the sullen, downcast, dogged\nfaces with which, fluctuating between fear and shame, the domestic\ntraitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life.These things\nthought themselves the superior of a man like me!and you, foolish\nwench, think so meanly of your Deity as to suppose wretches like them\nare the work of Omnipotence!"said Catharine, warmly; "the God I worship\ncreated these men with the attributes to know and adore Him, to guard\nand defend their fellow creatures, to practise holiness and virtue.Their own vices, and the temptations of the Evil One, have made them\nsuch as they now are.Oh, take the lesson home to thine own heart of\nadamant!Heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows, gave thee eyes to look\ninto the secrets of nature, a sagacious heart, and a skilful hand; but\nthy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts, and made an ungodly atheist\nof one who might have been a Christian sage!""Atheist, say\'st thou?""Perhaps I have doubts on that\nmatter--but they will be soon solved.Yonder comes one who will send\nme, as he has done thousands, to the place where all mysteries shall be\ncleared."Catharine followed the mediciner\'s eye up one of the forest glades, and\nbeheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop.In\nthe midst was a pennon displayed, which, though its bearings were not\nvisible to Catharine, was, by a murmur around, acknowledged as that of\nthe Black Douglas.They halted within arrow shot of the castle, and a\nherald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal, where, after a\nloud flourish, he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded Archibald\nEarl of Douglas, Lord Lieutenant of the King, and acting for the time\nwith the plenary authority of his Majesty; commanding, at the same time,\nthat the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms, all under\npenalty of high treason.said Eviot to Ramorny, who stood sullen and undecided."Will\nyou give orders to render the castle, or must I?"interrupted the knight, "to the last I will command you.Open the gates, drop the bridge, and render the castle to the Douglas.""Now, that\'s what may be called a gallant exertion of free will," said\nDwining."Just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute\nsince should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed\nthrough them by a frowsy trumpeter."said Catharine, "either be silent or turn thy thoughts\nto the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing.""Thou canst not, wench,\nhelp hearing what I say to thee, and thou wilt tell it again, for thy\nsex cannot help that either.Perth and all Scotland shall know what a\nman they have lost in Henbane Dwining!"The clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and\nentered the castle, and were in the act of disarming the small garrison.Earl Douglas himself appeared on the battlements, with a few of his\nfollowers, and signed to them to take Ramorny and Dwining into custody.Others dragged from some nook the stupefied Bonthron."It was to these three that the custody of the Prince was solely\ncommitted daring his alleged illness?"said the Douglas, prosecuting an\ninquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle."No other saw him, my lord," said Eviot, "though I offered my services.""Conduct us to the Duke\'s apartment, and bring the prisoners with\nus.Also should there be a female in the castle, if she hath not been\nmurdered or spirited away--the companion of the glee maiden who brought\nthe first alarm.""She is here, my lord," said Eviot, bringing Catharine forward.Her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the\nimpassible Earl."Fear nothing, maiden," he said; "thou hast deserved both praise and\nreward.Tell to me, as thou wouldst confess to Heaven, the things thou\nhast witnessed in this castle."Few words served Catharine to unfold the dreadful story."It agrees," said the Douglas, "with the tale of the glee maiden, from\npoint to point.They passed to the room which the unhappy Duke of Rothsay had been\nsupposed to inhabit; but the key was not to be found, and the Earl could\nonly obtain entrance by forcing the door.On entering, the wasted and\nsqualid remains of the unhappy Prince were discovered, flung on the bed\nas if in haste.The intention of the murderers had apparently been to\narrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse, but they\nhad been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of Louise.Douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth, whose wild passions\nand caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe."I had wrongs to be redressed," he said; "but to see such a sight as\nthis banishes all remembrance of injury!"It should have been arranged," said Dwining, "more to your\nomnipotence\'s pleasure; but you came suddenly on us, and hasty masters\nmake slovenly service."Douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said, so closely did he\nexamine the wan and wasted features, and stiffened limbs, of the dead\nbody before him.Catharine, overcome by sickness and fainting, at length\nobtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene, and, through\nconfusion of every description, found her way to her former apartment,\nwhere she was locked in the arms of Louise, who had returned in the\ninterval.The dying hand of the Prince\nwas found to be clenched upon a lock of hair, resembling, in colour and\ntexture, the coal black bristles of Bonthron.Thus, though famine had\nbegun the work, it would seem that Rothsay\'s death had been finally\naccomplished by violence.The private stair to the dungeon, the keys of\nwhich were found at the subaltern assassin\'s belt, the situation of the\nvault, its communication with the external air by the fissure in the\nwalls, and the wretched lair of straw, with the fetters which remained\nthere, fully confirmed the story of Catharine and of the glee woman."We will not hesitate an instant," said the Douglas to his near kinsman,\nthe Lord Balveny, as soon as they returned from the dungeon."But, my lord, some trial may be fitting," answered Balveny."I have taken them red hand; my\nauthority will stretch to instant execution.Yet stay--have we not some\nJedwood men in our troop?""Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth," said\nBalveny."Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,\nsaving a little shifting for their living.Do you see to the execution\nof these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we\'ll try\nwhether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first; we will\nhave Jedwood justice--hang in haste and try at leisure.""Yet stay, my lord," said Ramorny, "you may rue your haste--will you\ngrant me a word out of earshot?"said Douglas; "speak out what thou hast to say before\nall that are here present.""Know all; then," said Ramorny, aloud, "that this noble Earl had letters\nfrom the Duke of Albany and myself, sent him by the hand of yon cowardly\ndeserter, Buncle--let him deny it if he dare--counselling the removal\nof the Duke for a space from court, and his seclusion in this Castle of\nFalkland.""But not a word," replied Douglas, sternly smiling, "of his being flung\ninto a dungeon--famished--strangled.Away with the wretches, Balveny,\nthey pollute God\'s air too long!"The prisoners were dragged off to the battlements.But while the means\nof execution were in the act of being prepared, the apothecary expressed\nso ardent a desire to see Catharine once more, and, as he said, for\nthe good of his soul, that the maiden, in hopes his obduracy might have\nundergone some change even at the last hour, consented again to go\nto the battlements, and face a scene which her heart recoiled from.A single glance showed her Bonthron, sunk in total and drunken\ninsensibility; Ramorny, stripped of his armour, endeavouring in vain to\nconceal fear, while he spoke with a priest, whose good offices he had\nsolicited; and Dwining, the same humble, obsequious looking, crouching\nindividual she had always known him.He held in his hand a little silver\npen, with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment."Catharine," he said--"he, he, he!--I wish to speak to thee on the\nnature of my religious faith.""If such be thy intention, why lose time with me?"The good father," said Dwining, "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of\nthe deity whom I have served.I therefore prefer to give the altar of\nmine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine.This scrap of parchment\nwill tell thee how to make your way into my chapel, where I have\nworshipped so often in safety.I leave the images which it contains to\nthee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less\nthan any of the absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to\ncall fellow creatures.And now away--or remain and see if the end of the\nquacksalver belies his life.""Nay," said the mediciner, "I have but a single word to say, and yonder\nnobleman\'s valiancie may hear it if he will."Lord Balveny approached, with some curiosity; for the undaunted\nresolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in\nperson a poor dwindled dwarf, had to him an air of something resembling\nsorcery.""You see this trifling implement," said the criminal, showing the\nsilver pen."By means of this I can escape the power even of the Black\nDouglas.""Give him no ink nor paper," said Balveny, hastily, "he will draw a\nspell.""Not so, please your wisdom and valiancie--he, he, he!"said Dwining\nwith his usual chuckle, as he unscrewed the top of the pen, within which\nwas a piece of sponge or some such substance, no bigger than a pea."Now, mark this--" said the prisoner, and drew it between his lips.He lay a dead corpse before them, the\ncontemptuous sneer still on his countenance.Catharine shrieked and fled, seeking, by a hasty descent, an escape from\na sight so appalling.Lord Balveny was for a moment stupified, and then\nexclaimed, "This may be glamour!hang him over the battlements, quick\nor dead.If his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space, it shall\nreturn to a body with a dislocated neck."Ramorny and Bonthron were then ordered for\nexecution.The last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what\nwas designed to be done with him.Ramorny, pale as death, yet with\nthe same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin, pleaded his\nknighthood, and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the\nsword, and not by the noose."The Douglas never alters his doom," said Balveny."But thou shalt have\nall thy rights.The menial whom he called appeared at his summons."What shakest thou for, fellow?"said Balveny; "here, strike me this\nman\'s gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver.And now, John Ramorny,\nthou art no longer a knight, but a knave.To the halter with him,\nprovost marshal!hang him betwixt his companions, and higher than them\nif it may be."In a quarter of an hour afterwards, Balveny descended to tell the\nDouglas that the criminals were executed."Then there is no further use in the trial," said the Earl."How say\nyou, good men of inquest, were these men guilty of high treason--ay or\nno?""Guilty," exclaimed the obsequious inquest, with edifying unanimity, "we\nneed no farther evidence.""Sound trumpets, and to horse then, with our own train only; and let\neach man keep silence on what has chanced here, until the proceedings\nshall be laid before the King, which cannot conveniently be till the\nbattle of Palm Sunday shall be fought and ended.Select our attendants,\nand tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who\nprates dies."In a few minutes the Douglas was on horseback, with the followers\nselected to attend his person.Expresses were sent to his daughter, the\nwidowed Duchess of Rothsay, directing her to take her course to Perth,\nby the shores of Lochleven, without approaching Falkland, and committing\nto her charge Catharine Glover and the glee woman, as persons whose\nsafety he tendered.As they rode through the forest, they looked back, and beheld the three\nbodies hanging, like specks darkening the walls of the old castle."The hand is punished," said Douglas, "but who shall arraign the head by\nwhose direction the act was done?""I do, kinsman; and were I to listen to the dictates of my heart, I\nwould charge him with the deed, which I am certain he has authorised.But there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion, and Albany has\nattached to himself the numerous friends of the house of Stuart, to\nwhom, indeed, the imbecility of the King and the ill regulated habits\nof Rothsay left no other choice of a leader.Were I, therefore, to break\nthe bond which I have so lately formed with Albany, the consequence\nmust be civil war, an event ruinous to poor Scotland while threatened\nby invasion from the activity of the Percy, backed by the treachery\nof March.No, Balveny, the punishment of Albany must rest with Heaven,\nwhich, in its own good time, will execute judgment on him and on his\nhouse."The hour is nigh: now hearts beat high;\n     Each sword is sharpen\'d well;\n     And who dares die, who stoops to fly,\n     Tomorrow\'s light shall tell.We are now to recall to our reader\'s recollection, that Simon Glover and\nhis fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having\ntime to announce to Henry Smith either their departure or the alarming\ncause of it.When, therefore, the lover appeared in Curfew Street, on\nthe morning of their flight, instead of the hearty welcome of the honest\nburgher, and the April reception, half joy half censure, which he had\nbeen promised on the part of his lovely daughter, he received only the\nastounding intelligence, that her father and she had set off early, on\nthe summons of a stranger, who had kept himself carefully muffled from\nobservation.To this, Dorothy, whose talents for forestalling evil, and\ncommunicating her views of it, are known to the reader, chose to add,\nthat she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the\nHighlands, to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by\ntwo or three apparitors, who, in the name of a Commission appointed by\nthe King, had searched the house, put seals upon such places as were\nsupposed to contain papers, and left citations for father and daughter\nto appear before the Court of Commission, on a day certain, under pain\nof outlawry.All these alarming particulars Dorothy took care to state\nin the gloomiest colours, and the only consolation which she afforded\nthe alarmed lover was, that her master had charged her to tell him to\nreside quietly at Perth, and that he should soon hear news of them.This\nchecked the smith\'s first resolve, which was to follow them instantly to\nthe Highlands, and partake the fate which they might encounter.But when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the Clan\nQuhele, and particularly his personal quarrel with Conachar, who was now\nraised to be a high chief, he could not but think, on reflection, that\nhis intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb\nthe safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service\nto them.He was well acquainted with Simon\'s habitual intimacy with\nthe chief of the Clan Quhele, and justly augured that the glover would\nobtain protection, which his own arrival might be likely to disturb,\nwhile his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with\na whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers.At the same time his heart\nthrobbed with indignation, when he thought of Catharine being within the\nabsolute power of young Conachar, whose rivalry he could not doubt, and\nwho had now so many means of urging his suit.What if the young chief\nshould make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the\ndaughter?He distrusted not Catharine\'s affections, but then her mode\nof thinking was so disinterested, and her attachment to her father so\ntender, that, if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his\nsecurity, or perhaps his life, it was matter of deep and awful doubt\nwhether it might not be found light in the balance.Tormented by\nthoughts on which we need not dwell, he resolved nevertheless to\nremain at home, stifle his anxiety as he might, and await the promised\nintelligence from the old man.It came, but it did not relieve his\nconcern.Sir Patrick Charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to\nthe smith the plans of the fugitives.But, amid the bustle occasioned by\nthe movement of troops, he could not himself convey the intelligence.He therefore entrusted to his agent, Kitt Henshaw, the task of making it\nknown.But this worthy person, as the reader knows, was in the interest\nof Ramorny, whose business it was to conceal from every one, but\nespecially from a lover so active and daring as Henry, the real place of\nCatharine\'s residence.Henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith\nthat his friend the glover was secure in the Highlands; and though he\naffected to be more reserved on the subject of Catharine, he said little\nto contradict the belief that she as well as Simon shared the protection\nof the Clan Quhele.But he reiterated, in the name of Sir Patrick,\nassurances that father and daughter were both well, and that Henry would\nbest consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and\nwaiting the course of events.With an agonized heart, therefore, Henry Gow determined to remain quiet\ntill he had more certain intelligence, and employed himself in finishing\na shirt of mail, which he intended should be the best tempered and the\nmost finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed.This\nexercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which\nhe could have adopted, and served as an apology for secluding himself\nin his workshop, and shunning society, where the idle reports which were\ndaily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him.He resolved to\ntrust in the warm regard of Simon, the faith of his daughter, and the\nfriendship of the provost, who, having so highly commended his valour\nin the combat with Bonthron, would never, he thought, desert him at this\nextremity of his fortunes.Time, however, passed on day by day; and\nit was not till Palm Sunday was near approaching, that Sir Patrick\nCharteris, having entered the city to make some arrangements for the\nensuing combat, bethought himself of making a visit to the Smith of the\nWynd.He entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him, and\nwhich made Henry instantly augur that he brought bad news.The smith\ncaught the alarm, and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent\nupon the heated iron, while the agitated arm that wielded it, strong\nbefore as that of a giant, became so powerless, that it was with\ndifficulty Henry was able to place the weapon on the ground, instead of\ndropping it from his hand."My poor Henry," said Sir Patrick, "I bring you but cold news; they are\nuncertain, however, and, if true, they are such as a brave man like you\nshould not take too deeply to heart.""In God\'s name, my lord," said Henry, "I trust you bring no evil news of\nSimon Glover or his daughter?""Touching themselves," said Sir Patrick, "no: they are safe and well.But as to thee, Henry, my tidings are more cold.Kitt Henshaw has, I\nthink, apprised thee that I had endeavoured to provide Catharine Glover\nwith a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady, the Duchess\nof Rothsay.But she hath declined the charge, and Catharine hath been\nsent to her father in the Highlands.Thou\nmayest have heard that Gilchrist MacIan is dead, and that his son\nEachin, who was known in Perth as the apprentice of old Simon, by the\nname of Conachar, is now the chief of Clan Quhele; and I heard from one\nof my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the MacIans that the\nyoung chief seeks the hand of Catharine in marriage.My domestic learned\nthis--as a secret, however--while in the Breadalbane country, on some\narrangements touching the ensuing combat.The thing is uncertain but,\nHenry, it wears a face of likelihood.""Did your lordship\'s servant see Simon Glover and his daughter?"said\nHenry, struggling for breath, and coughing, to conceal from the provost\nthe excess of his agitation."He did not," said Sir Patrick; "the Highlanders seemed jealous, and\nrefused to permit him to speak to the old man, and he feared to alarm\nthem by asking to see Catharine.Besides, he talks no Gaelic, nor had\nhis informer much English, so there may be some mistake in the matter.Nevertheless, there is such a report, and I thought it best to tell it\nyou.But you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the\naffair of Palm Sunday be over; and I advise you to take no step till we\nlearn the circumstances of the matter, for certainty is most desirable,\neven when it is painful.Go you to the council house," he added, after a\npause, "to speak about the preparations for the lists in the North Inch?"Well, Smith, I judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with\nthis matter; but, after all, women are weathercocks, that is the truth\non\'t.Solomon and others have proved it before you."And so Sir Patrick Charteris retired, fully convinced he had discharged\nthe office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner.With very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the\ntidings and listen to the consoling commentary."The provost," he said bitterly to himself, "is an excellent man; marry,\nhe holds his knighthood so high, that, if he speaks nonsense, a poor man\nmust hold it sense, as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him\nin his lordship\'s silver flagon.How would all this sound in another\nsituation?Suppose I were rolling down the steep descent of the\nCorrichie Dhu, and before I came to the edge of the rock, comes my Lord\nProvost, and cries: \'Henry, there is a deep precipice, and I grieve to\nsay you are in the fair way of rolling over it.But be not downcast,\nfor Heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress.However, I\nthought it would be comfort to you to know the worst, which you will\nbe presently aware of.I do not know how many hundred feet deep the\nprecipice descends, but you may form a judgment when you are at the\nbottom, for certainty is certainty.when come you to take\na game at bowls?\'And this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly\nattempt to save the poor wight\'s neck!When I think of this, I could go\nmad, seize my hammer, and break and destroy all around me.But I will\nbe calm; and if this Highland kite, who calls himself a falcon, should\nstoop at my turtle dove, he shall know whether a burgess of Perth can\ndraw a bow or not."It was now the Thursday before the fated Palm Sunday, and the champions\non either side were expected to arrive the next day, that they might\nhave the interval of Saturday to rest, refresh themselves, and prepare\nfor the combat.Two or three of each of the contending parties were\ndetached to receive directions about the encampment of their little\nband, and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper\nordering of the field.Henry was not, therefore, surprised at seeing a\ntall and powerful Highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which\nhe lived, in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine\nthe curiosities of one that is more civilized.The smith\'s heart rose\nagainst the man on account of his country, to which our Perth burgher\nbore a natural prejudice, and more especially as he observed the\nindividual wear the plaid peculiar to the Clan Quhele.The sprig of oak\nleaves, worked in silk, intimated also that the individual was one\nof those personal guards of young Eachin, upon whose exertions in the\nfuture battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan.Having observed so much, Henry withdrew into his smithy, for the sight\nof the man raised his passion; and, knowing that the Highlander came\nplighted to a solemn combat, and could not be the subject of any\ninferior quarrel, he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse\nwith him.In a few minutes, however, the door of the smithy flew open,\nand flattering in his tartans, which greatly magnified his actual size,\nthe Gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal\ndignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with.He stood\nlooking around him, and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy\nand regarded with wonder.But Henry had no sort of inclination to\nindulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was\nlying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitor\'s presence.(the bandy legged smith), said the Highlander."Those that wish to be crook backed call me so," answered Henry."No offence meant," said the Highlander; "but her own self comes to buy\nan armour.""Her own self\'s bare shanks may trot hence with her," answered Henry; "I\nhave none to sell.""If it was not within two days of Palm Sunday, herself would make you\nsing another song," retorted the Gael."And being the day it is," said Henry, with the same contemptuous\nindifference, "I pray you to stand out of my light.""You are an uncivil person; but her own self is fir nan ord too; and she\nknows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot.""If her nainsell be hammer man herself, her nainsell may make her nain\nharness," replied Henry."And so her nainsell would, and never fash you for the matter; but it\nis said, Gow Chrom, that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and\nharnishes that you work, that have power to make the blades cut steel\nlinks as if they were paper, and the plate and mail turn back steel\nlances as if they were boddle prins?""They tell your ignorance any nonsense that Christian men refuse to\nbelieve," said Henry."I whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost,\nlike an honest craftsman, and commonly it is the Highlandman\'s \'Och hone\nfor Houghman stares!\'"Friend, it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled,"\nsaid the Highlander, haughtily."Her own self cannot fight even now, and\nthere is little gallantry in taunting her thus.""By nails and hammer, you are right there," said the smith, altering his\ntone."But speak out at once, friend, what is it thou wouldst have of\nme?I am in no humour for dallying.""A hauberk for her chief, Eachin MacIan," said the Highlander."You are a hammer man, you say?said our\nsmith, producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately\nemployed.The Gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of\nenvy in it.He looked curiously at every part of its texture, and at\nlength declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen."A hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be e\'en\nower cheap an offer," said the Highlandman, by way of tentative; "but\nher nainsell will never bid thee less, come by them how she can.""It is a fair proffer," replied Henry; "but gold nor gear will never buy\nthat harness.I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will\nnot give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of\nthree blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief\'s upon\nthese terms.""Hut, prut, man--take a drink and go to bed," said the Highlander, in\ngreat scorn.Think ye the captain of the Clan Quhele will\nbe brawling and battling with a bit Perth burgess body like you?Whisht,\nman, and hearken.Her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged\nto your kin.She will fight you for the fair harness hersell.""She must first show that she is my match," said Henry, with a grim\nsmile.I, one of Eachin MacIan\'s leichtach, and not your match!""You may try me, if you will.Do you know\nhow to cast a sledge hammer?""Ay, truly--ask the eagle if he can fly over Farragon.""But before you strive with me, you must first try a cast with one of my\nleichtach.Here, Dunter, stand forth for the honour of Perth!And now,\nHighlandman, there stands a row of hammers; choose which you will, and\nlet us to the garden."The Highlander whose name was Norman nan Ord, or Norman of the Hammer,\nshowed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the\nset, at which Henry smiled.Dunter, the stout journeyman of the smith,\nmade what was called a prodigious cast; but the Highlander, making a\ndesperate effort, threw beyond it by two or three feet, and looked with\nan air of triumph to Henry, who again smiled in reply.said the Gael, offering our smith the hammer."Not with that child\'s toy," said Henry, "which has scarce weight to\nfly against the wind.Jannekin, fetch me Sampson; or one of you help the\nboy, for Sampson is somewhat ponderous."The hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the\nHighlander had selected as one of unusual weight.Norman stood\nastonished; but he was still more so when Henry, taking his position,\nswung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint, and\ndismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine.The\nair groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it.Down at length it\ncame, and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth, a full yard beyond\nthe cast of Norman.The Highlander, defeated and mortified, went to the spot where the\nweapon lay, lifted it, poised it in his hand with great wonder, and\nexamined it closely, as if he expected to discover more in it than a\ncommon hammer.He at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy\nsmile, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked\nhim whether he would not mend his cast."Norman has lost too much at the sport already," he replied."She has\nlost her own name of the Hammerer.But does her own self, the Gow Chrom,\nwork at the anvil with that horse\'s load of iron?""You shall see, brother," said Henry, leading the way to the smithy."Dunter," he said, "rax me that bar from the furnace"; and uplifting\nSampson, as he called the monstrous hammer, he plied the metal with a\nhundred strokes from right to left--now with the right hand, now with\nthe left, now with both, with so much strength at once and dexterity,\nthat he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in\nhalf the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same\npurpose, using a more manageable implement.said the Highlander, "and what for would you be fighting\nwith our young chief, who is far above your standard, though you were\nthe best smith ever wrought with wind and fire?"said Henry; "you seem a good fellow, and I\'ll tell you the\ntruth.Your master has wronged me, and I give him this harness freely\nfor the chance of fighting him myself.""Nay, if he hath wronged you he must meet you," said the life guardsman."To do a man wrong takes the eagle\'s feather out of the chief\'s bonnet;\nand were he the first in the Highlands, and to be sure so is Eachin,\nhe must fight the man he has wronged, or else a rose falls from his\nchaplet.""Will you move him to this," said Henry, "after the fight on Sunday?""Oh, her nainsell will do her best, if the hawks have not got her\nnainsell\'s bones to pick; for you must know, brother, that Clan\nChattan\'s claws pierce rather deep.""The armour is your chief\'s on that condition," said Henry; "but I will\ndisgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price.""Deil a fear--deil a fear; I will bring him in to the barrace myself,"\nsaid Norman, "assuredly.""You will do me a pleasure," replied Henry; "and that you may remember\nyour promise, I will bestow on you this dirk.Look--if you hold it\ntruly, and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your\nenemy, the surgeon will be needless."The Highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude, and took his\nleave."I have given him the best mail harness I ever wrought," said the smith\nto himself, rather repenting his liberality, "for the poor chance\nthat he will bring his chief into a fair field with me; and then let\nCatharine be his who can win her fairly.But much I dread the youth will\nfind some evasion, unless he have such luck on Palm Sunday as may induce\nhim to try another combat.That is some hope, however; for I have often,\nere now, seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a\ndwarf into a giant queller."Thus, with little hope, but with the most determined resolution, Henry\nSmith awaited the time that should decide his fate.What made him augur\nthe worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter."They are ashamed," he said, "to confess the truth to me, and therefore\nthey are silent."Upon the Friday at noon, the two bands of thirty men each, representing\nthe contending clans, arrived at the several points where they were to\nhalt for refreshments.The Clan Quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of Scone,\nwhile the provost regaled their rivals at his Castle of Kinfauns, the\nutmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious\nattention, and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of\npartiality.All points of etiquette were, in the mean while, discussed\nand settled by the Lord High Constable Errol and the young Earl of\nCrawford, the former acting on the part of the Clan Chattan and the\nlatter patronising the Clan Quhele.Messengers were passing continually\nfrom the one earl to the other, and they held more than: six meetings\nwithin thirty hours, before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly\narranged.Meanwhile, in case of revival of ancient quarrel, many seeds of\nwhich existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours, a\nproclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile\nof the place where the Highlanders were quartered; while on their part\nthe intended combatants were prohibited from approaching Perth without\nspecial license.Troops were stationed to enforce this order, who did\ntheir charge so scrupulously as to prevent Simon Glover himself, burgess\nand citizen of Perth, from approaching the town, because he owned having\ncome thither at the same time with the champions of Eachin MacIan, and\nwore a plaid around him of their check or pattern.This interruption\nprevented Simon from seeking out Henry Wynd and possessing him with a\ntrue knowledge of all that had happened since their separation, which\nintercourse, had it taken place, must have materially altered the\ncatastrophe of our narrative.On Saturday afternoon another arrival took place, which interested the\ncity almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat.This\nwas the approach of the Earl Douglas, who rode through the town with a\ntroop of only thirty horse, but all of whom were knights and gentlemen\nof the first consequence.Men\'s eyes followed this dreaded peer as they\npursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds, unable to ken the\ncourse of the bird of Jove yet silent, attentive, and as earnest in\nobserving him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps\nthrough the firmament; He rode slowly through the city, and passed out\nat the northern gate.He next alighted at the Dominican convent and\ndesired to see the Duke of Albany.The Earl was introduced instantly,\nand received by the Duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful\nand conciliatory, but which could not conceal both art and inquietude.When the first greetings were over, the Earl said with great gravity:\n"I bring you melancholy news.Your Grace\'s royal nephew, the Duke of\nRothsay, is no more, and I fear hath perished by some foul practices."said the Duke\' in confusion--"what practices?Who dared\npractise on the heir of the Scottish throne?""\'Tis not for me to state how these doubts arise," said Douglas; "but\nmen say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing,\nand the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood.""Earl of Douglas," said the Duke of Albany, "I am no reader of riddles.""Nor am I a propounder of them," said Douglas, haughtily, "Your Grace\nwill find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal.I will go for\nhalf an hour to the cloister garden, and then rejoin you.""You go not to the King, my lord?""No," answered Douglas; "I trust your Grace will agree with me that we\nshould conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the\nbusiness of tomorrow be decided.""If the King heard of this loss, he\ncould not witness the combat; and if he appear not in person, these men\nare likely to refuse to fight, and the whole work is cast loose.But\nI pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers\nrespecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty\nglance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the\nlast importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this\nmanner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these\nmost melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can\nrenew the divisions in the King\'s councils, which were settled by the\nlast solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy\nnephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him\na graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that\nmatter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good\nunderstanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require\nshould exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to\nlook closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You\nhastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for\nexercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable\nmurderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I\nam obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of\nthese wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked\non them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this\nsacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been\nin the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication\ntogether, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a\nproposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year\nor two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace\'s purpose, as expressed to me," said the\nEarl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for\ntheir own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination\non our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my\npart, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,\ntouching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father\'s\nclaims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or\nFalkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet\nfeels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps\nwith his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the\nrecompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,\n     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,\nthe use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat\nwould have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The\nChurch of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy\nseason of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was\naccomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs\nshould respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious\nviolence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed\nall observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the\nmost solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because\nthey hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided\nfor defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,\nhad been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the\nsacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to\nwhich this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed\nwith the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in\nthem.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute\nfor palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and\nCarthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of\ndevotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great\ncare had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not\neven come within the sound of each other\'s bagpipes; for it was certain\nthat, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would\nhave sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place\nof combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the\nstreets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their\ndevotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from\ntheir appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in\nthe approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not\nhabitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,\nnotwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of\nthe mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify\neither curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then\npresented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared\nventure a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight\nstalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes\nand sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of\nthe Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by\nthe handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin\nMacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection\nof his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble\nglover\'s apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving\nby one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who\nhad been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant\nchampions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,\njealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the\nglover\'s apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a\nchieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape\nof his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,\nseemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live\nor die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that\nhe looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as\nhe might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to\ndespatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to\nhimself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where\nthere was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in\nthis holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that\nI am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my\nown best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from\nthe conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he\nmay well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of\nan encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his\nchampion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all\nI can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the\nhead.I will to the other church in\nquest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the\nsmith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into\nspeedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the\nsolemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way\nthrough the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin\nthat their eyes encountered.The smith\'s hardy and embrowned countenance\n up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained\nits dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin\'s features glowed with a\nbrighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot\nfrom his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his\ngaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was\nencountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and\nlooked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already\nat a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here\nalso the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so\nlately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace\non earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to\nthe place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow\ncreatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with\nthe savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their\ngladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired\nof making way through it.But the general deference entertained for\nHenry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of\nhis ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room\nfor him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the\nClan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next\nfollowed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with\nthe appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to\nprotect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more\nthan fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any\ndecay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks\nwere in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture\nwere as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had\nnot passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light\nexpressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience\ndwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen\nchampions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on\nseveral of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence\nof one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was\nexpected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their\nhigh mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when\nthe diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland\ntongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps\nthat the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid\nthe battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere\nwe are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for\ntwo of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,\nrather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet\nthere were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of\nthe deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the\ndetermined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard\nDay, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such\nindemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence\nof the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level\nplain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial\nexercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was\nerected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of\none hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced\nby the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators\nsurrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by\narmed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of\nspectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,\nthere was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,\nso highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded\nornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or\nGilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or\nbattle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on\nthe Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but\naged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the\nopposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into\nthe earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not\nto join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took\ntheir places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which\non similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect\namusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned\nno answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite\nextremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be\nadmitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either\naccess; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at\nthe other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the\nappropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and\ndagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the\nalarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and\ncried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of\ntheir number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have\ncounted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight\ncould not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general\napprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the\npreparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect\nof the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan\nQuhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,\neach attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the\nlists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the\nEarl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir\nPatrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself\nwilling and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the\ndisparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a\nsubterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will\nbe, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,\nEachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of\nthe man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,\nas he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief\nis to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that\nour chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele\ndoes not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the\nobjection was made to Hector\'s being withdrawn from the battle, and\nhe was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself\ninterfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid\nand selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly\nto submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was\nmorally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding\nthe combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing\nit."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword\nsheathed during this day\'s glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there\nare enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps\non the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy\nspirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the\nfirst flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not\nbe much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the\nchief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he\ncan, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as\nthey stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are\nnearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find\nan auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a\nhigh reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,\nwho will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is\nexpected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely\ntake a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of\nthe Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my\nlords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make\nproclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan\nChattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present\npayment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl\nMarshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before\nyou.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis\nChattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a\nfellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,\nstopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been\ndirected, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one\nto accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of\nthe Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of\ncitizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake\nthe task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of\nthe Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time\nwith Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the\nmagistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of\nthe Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat\nfor the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a\nman to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such\nfools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers\nat a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir\nherald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan\nChattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,\nnot being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry\'s behaviour,\nconcluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of\nfighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor\nshirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had\nmade for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon\nfind on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for\ntwo handed sword, why, this boy\'s brand will serve my turn till I can\nmaster a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou\nshalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which\nyour brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn\nwell enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not\nwrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear\nout without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into\nthe town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,\nwhen, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a\nfemale was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude\ngave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste\nunder the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The\nwidow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she\nbore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on\nthe fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed\nto his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of\nhis grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved\nweapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully\nreceived the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste\nassisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God\nfor the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come\nbefore him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook\nhimself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing\nthe two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air\nthrough which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease\nand sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could\nwield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march\nin their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each\nother, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the\nKing was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again\ncuriously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,\nand endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the\ncombat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression\nand retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their\ncountenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of\npride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation\nof the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general\nissue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The\nclear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general\nfavourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,\nwere taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself\nfell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the\nchiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment\nHenry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were\nnow silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry\nSmith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from\nthe smith\'s handling," was Henry\'s first thought; his second was to turn\nand speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert\nthe band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,\nconsistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties\nwere disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing\nten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual\nas offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five\nfeet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were\nto come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the\nright of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed\nhimself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of\nthem occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and\ntwo others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in\nparticular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus\nEachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,\nhaving four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in\nhis rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,\nonly that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of\nbeing on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the\nopposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to\npropose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan\nChattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having\nreminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his\nhand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately\nbehind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not\ndecline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated\ntheir feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,\nwhich, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by\nthe Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and\nmenacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of\ntheir opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was\nagitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing\nthat he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke\nto his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them\nto combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death\nor victory.The trumpets\nof the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and\nmaddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,\nand increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together\nin the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an\nadvancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their\nlong swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the\nsecond and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by\nthe eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the\nintervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the\nhuge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with\nblood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,\nrather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to\nbe wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded\ntogether to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to\ntheir poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those\nopposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of\nthose who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,\naccording to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could\nhardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose\neyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could\nnevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The\nconflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,\nbut it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired\nit almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and\nstimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded\na retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a\ndirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each\nother, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators\ngreedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew\noff from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had\nsustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost\nrather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody\nplaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown\ntheir mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About\ntwenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs\nlopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder\ninto the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly\ncharacter of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which\nwielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with\nthe most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had\nfought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,\nhis bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding\nhim in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space\nof about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly\none third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer\nto the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which\nwas encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were\nobserved, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of\nthe field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood\nwhich poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as\nhis remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he\nstood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried\nto ten yards\' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had\nswept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the\nbodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck\na blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt\nat himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach\nbecame alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again\ndraw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a\ndistance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean\nand cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am\nsuch," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day\'s\nwage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I\nreward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which\nbest likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who\nsaw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined\nthe rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to\nthe chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its\nneighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival\nwas mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though\nunarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld\nhim with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his\nhand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his\ncourage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his\nfoster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation\nof his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive\nthe idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster\nson, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his\ngrief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking\nEachin\'s life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind\nrejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something\nwhich was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of\nenchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now\nanxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now\ndarken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands\nthe fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,\nmiserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"\nanswered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own\near has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the\nbattle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can\ngainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak\nshall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring\naround him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for\nHector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called\nboldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached\neach other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected\neach other\'s valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,\nadvanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there\nwas a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing\nto obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to\nstrike; but, just as he came within sword\'s length, he dropt the long\nand cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith\'s sword, as he fetched\na cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry\'s guard,\nstruck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,\ndirecting the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the\nsame time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining\nof tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been\nended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long\nsword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,\nbut not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft\nhis skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to\nengage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son\nEachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their\nchief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at\nonce, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the\nbrave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith\'s\nassistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry\'s own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his\ndevoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those\nwho had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of\nthe battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show\nof valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children\nof the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their\nbrethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part\nof the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not\nfall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons\nof the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most\ndistinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to\ndisadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now\nthe number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan\nChattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,\nand that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were\nfour of the chief\'s bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,\ntheir fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,\nwas still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold\nhearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father\'s shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully\nanswered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the\nClan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It\nwas bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or\nthree were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five\nwere left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the\nnumber, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance\nused to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without\ninjury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into\nsullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,\nthrough the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to\nanimate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the\nfriends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict\ndrawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the\nriver, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with\nthe bodies of the slain."For God\'s sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"\nsaid the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be\nended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be\nsuffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and\naccept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest\nof the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,\nthe whole day\'s work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,\nthat you would not cry \'hold.\'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should\nprotect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother\nof his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving\nsubjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear\nwitness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the\nDominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise\nfor me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the\nsights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know\nthat God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally\nlonger."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young\nchief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you\nwill come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have\none by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the\nleast of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the\nquiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I\nbut little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain\nas if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and\nthe day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain\nalive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again\nmingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated\ninveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained\nneuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old\nchampions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the\nextremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene\nof action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually\nimpelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive\nthem.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the\nstandards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,\nthen grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at\nlength, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the\nTay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each\nother\'s arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,\ninfected next the minstrels.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,\nhad done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw\nthe dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They\nthrew down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with\ntheir daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent\nthan in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly\nslain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,\nagain grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured\nits expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had\nbreath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that\npart of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland\nchief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan\ndhu, or, "black chanter."\'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his\nbrethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had\nbeen mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other\ntwo remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his\nfoster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten\nof the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their\nenemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come\nup with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved\nto make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death\ndrew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed\nthroughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save\nHector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that\nman may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened\narmour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit\nthee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make\nwhat play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for\nthey are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of\nmy soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should\ndie."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief\'s\nhauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which\nfear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,\n"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you\nput on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward\nwith the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody\nfield, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of\nthunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of\nthe Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,\nas they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to\nthreaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were\nhushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,\nas if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and\nTorquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had\ndrawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was\nmutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had\ncast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,\nduring the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone\nhe had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with\nHector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have\nexisted, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat\ndeprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain\nattempt to put on his foster brother\'s harness, became animated by an\nemotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster\nfather in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan\nshould come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined\nto take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft\nfrom the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last\nbreath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of\nhis last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had\nhunted him through the whole field standing within sword\'s point of\nhim, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his\nlife through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his\nconstitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected\nat the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a\nline of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and\nblood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart\nsickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,\nall other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;\nand, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which\nwas aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former\ncould recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,\nperhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved\notherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in\nsilence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of\nhis flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him\nas soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on\nthe grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were\npouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and\nothers went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with\nparticular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I\nwill change thy leathern apron for a knight\'s girdle, and thy burgage\ntenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have\nshed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the\nonly purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,\nand have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own\npleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the\nexpression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered\nthe barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal\nmatters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that\nare spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily\nwounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir\nPatrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl\'s kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning\nhis horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas\nhad recalled him from death\'s door, had there been a drop of gentle\nblood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns\ndismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very\nfaintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other\nburgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you\nto this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"\n\n"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,\nthough something affronted at Henry\'s rejection of his offer, was too\nmagnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,\nif Douglas\'s banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas\ncan give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a\nfather go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises\ngold!""Under your lordship\'s favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight\nand noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may\nreject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen\nmay dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no\noffence," said the Douglas.But," he\nadded, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from\nthis bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over\nbroad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I\ngrieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might\nhave decided a pitched field in their country\'s cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running\ndown his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,\nnobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls\nof the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to\nthe slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both\nservices, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of\nsixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)\nwho strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were\nconveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the\ndead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession\nwhich conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had\nleft it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the\nbloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the\ndefeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it\nconsisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after\nthis eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The\nClan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and\nthe best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the\nrace of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,\nAlbany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of\nDouglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at\nFalkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my\nbreast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it\nnot for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own\nmind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to\nhis own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and\nthine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou\ndarest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must\nand will discharge it."The King looked at him with\nsurprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou\nwouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its\nconsequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the\nbetter that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy\nreflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half\nchoked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see\nor hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who\nlie piled on it like carrion.It must\nbe--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless\nnephew.""Albany, as\nthy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy\nking, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but\nthe certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment\nlast night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,\nmy son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft\nfather, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless\nand conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his\ngrief.But the agony of the King\'s sorrow almost instantly changed to\nfury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,\nthat the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious\nmaxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who\ngave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know\nit to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his\nbrother--stained with the blood of that brother\'s son?What ho,\nwithout there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if\nyou love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your\nnoble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment\nthe fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed\nhis broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King\ninfluenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his\nordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed\nby the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your\nGrace\'s royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion\nsoon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent\'s\nchild--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion\nwhich glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who\nendeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,\nand muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for\nhis understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful\nBrandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye\nand determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his\nmental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one\nword--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your\nBrandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken\nKing, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a\ndrawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom\ncounsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King\'s mood was softening, replied with more\nfirmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of\ndeath.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty\'s\nwords imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,\nby the souls of our royal parents--"\n\n"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was\nthis all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them\nto thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are\nboth of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped\nbeing a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre\nof Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of\nPrince James, who succeeds to his brother\'s rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,\nto his brother\'s perils!You have reminded\nme that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with\nwhat speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to\nthee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that\nman, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to\nbe instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes\' hearts shall defend the child\ntill we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle\'s ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody\nman!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek\nnot to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,\nthat hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with\ntheir partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further\njustification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke\nof Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death\nof Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by\ntaking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged\nmonarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn\nover the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life\nof him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James\'s security,\nhe sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the\nreigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland\nsailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce\nfor the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him\na prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy\nKing Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the\ntreachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany\'s own grey hairs\nwent, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency\nwhich he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years\nafter the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and\nDuke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in\nexpiation of his father\'s guilt and his own.The honest heart that\'s free frae a\'\n     Intended fraud or guile,\n     However Fortune kick the ba\',\n     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the\nhorrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under\nthe protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That\nlady\'s temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the\nruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on\nthe summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,\nthere rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie\nLinn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic\nrock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar\nreared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or\ndevotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who\nwas its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of\nthe powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl\'s\nletters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which\nconducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason\nshe might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end\ngreatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the\nnight in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she\nordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits\nof both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful\nscenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward\nappearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more\ncalculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,\nhowever, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them\nall which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and\ninconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which\nCatharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to\nsave Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her\ndevotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and\ndismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in\nparticular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,\nher father\'s, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself\nlived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of\na repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound\nsorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart\nof the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious\ncharacter of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,\nwere fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all\nof them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with\na burgher\'s daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with\npleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little\ngarden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the\nconvent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated\nby a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might\neasily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters\nwhich foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that\nran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged\nwhat it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with\nleaves.At length the gay\nand bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which\nshe had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life\'s path lightly, if\nwe shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my\nmind is at present anxious respecting my father\'s safety; and I cannot\nbut think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,\neven within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas\'s\nequerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords\ncross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May\nCatharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of\nthe battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if\nit be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise\'s\nlittle dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to\ncower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can\ndistinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible\npassion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The\nfugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was\nbare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments\nlooked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern\nbuskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His\ncountenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish\nphrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing\nwhat was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by\nthe greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all\nthis?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,\nafter a moment\'s recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was\nhappy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there\nis no such clan as thou speak\'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to\nspeak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"\n\n"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward\nand villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm\nearth without its opening to devour me?He will not\nharm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down\non the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar\'s half\nfrenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know\nthy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than\nstrike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have\nlost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands\nbefore his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all\nmight see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down\nthe strath, man and woman called\'shame\' on me!The beggar to whom I\nflung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in\ndisgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung\nout, \'Shame on the recreant caitiff!\'The brute beasts in their lowing\nand bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse\nwaters in their dash and roar, cried, \'Out upon the dastard!\'The\nfaithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, \'Strike\nbut one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!\'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but\nwith a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two\nattendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the\ninstant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he\nwaved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air\nEachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed\nto pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of\nthe unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more\nthan one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the\nyoung captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of\nCampsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,\nhe met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness\nas a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is\nsaid, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his\ncell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in\nsuccession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the\ndaione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood\nand wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in\nhis left hand.Sometimes he\nseems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,\nalways flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his\nstory--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them\ncircumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in\nhis own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of\nCampsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence\nof the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly\nthe catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden\nrendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it\nshould not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own\namusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry\'s late\nexploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of\nthe encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both\nhonour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the\nDouglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of\nbloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected\nthat men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas\nof their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that\nof Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to\nthe deficiency which had led to Conachar\'s catastrophe.If she had\nany doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry\'s\nprotestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own\ncause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts\nof doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a\ntiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be\ndrawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it\nround you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul\nmasses for those who have fallen by Henry\'s sword; and that will not\nonly cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched\nDwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would\nnot mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute\nglover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly\namong the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of\nsuspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle\nof the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and\nhammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the\nboldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a\ngallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise\nto the tune of--\n\n     Bold and true,\n     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy\'s sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty\nLord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir\nPatrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory\nDowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most\nrespected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many\nindividuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their\ndescent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth.Sometimes with feet that never tire\n    They climb the tall cathedral spire;\n    When all the town is still below,\n    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,\n    By light of moon, and stars alone,\n    They dust the marble and the stone,\n          And with their brushes, small and great,\n          They paint and gild the dial-plate;\n          And bring the figures plain in sight\n          That all may note Time\'s rapid flight.And accidents they often know\n          While through the heavy works they go,\n          Where slowly turning wheels at last\n          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all\n          The hardships that may them befall,\n          Still persevere in every case\n          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly\n          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]\n\n    One night the Brownies stood beside\n    A long canal, whose silent tide\n    Connected seaboard cities great\n    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,\n    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;\n    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,\n    No mules were tugging on the shore;\n    All work on land and water too\n    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,\n    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,\n    For even rates, or shorter day,\n    Has caused the boats to loiter here\n    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round\n    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,\n    Upon some kitchen-stove or range\n    To spread an odor rich and strange;\n    Those squashes, too, should not be lost\n    By long exposure to the frost,\n    When they would prove so great a prize\n    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,\n    From some fine orchard picked with care,\n                    Should not to rot and ruin go,\n                    Though work is hard or wages low,\n                    When thousands would be glad to stew\n                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]\n\n    Another said: "We lack the might\n    To set the wrongs of labor right,\n    But by the power within us placed\n    We\'ll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied\n    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Then some ran here and there with speed\n    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about\n    The grassy banks, were fitted out\n                With straps and ropes without delay\n                To start the boats upon their way;\n                And next some straying goats were found,\n                Where in a yard they nibbled round\n                Destroying plants of rarest kind\n                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,\n    They found themselves in harness fast;\n    Then into active service pressed\n    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]\n\n    On deck some Brownies took their stand\n    To man the helm, or give command,\n    And oversee the work; while more\n    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along\n            And catch on snags or branches long,\n                    And cause delays they ill could bear,\n                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]\n\n            With accidents they often met,\n            And some were bruised and more were wet;\n            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;\n            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,\n            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,\n            When enterprises bold and new\n    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt\n    The work would still be carried out,\n    For extra strength would then be found\n    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout\n    They stood and stared or ran about\n    Till in the water, heels o\'er head,\n    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    A few could swim, and held their own;\n    But more went downward like a stone\n    Until, without the plummet\'s aid,\n            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings\n            That fright at such a moment brings,\n    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,\n    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team\n    Would pass along with sign and scream,\n    And those on land would know by this\n    That something startling was amiss;\n    And those on board could plainly see\n    Unless assistance there could be,\n    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,\n    There\'d be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]\n\n    By chance a net was to be had,\n    That boatmen used for catching shad--\n    A gill-net of the strongest kind,\n    For heavy catches well designed;\n    Few shad against its meshes ran\n    But left their bones on some one\'s pan,\n    This bulky thing the active crew\n    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,\n    While others in its folds were bound,\n    Until like fish in great dismay\n    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,\n    And quickly from the muddy bed\n    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled\n    The dripping net was upward hauled,\n    With all the Brownies clinging fast,\n    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]\n\n                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road\n                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed\n    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,\n    With many strange mishaps the while,\n    But working bravely through the night\n    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats\n    And patient mules, the heavy boats\n    For hours have glided on their way,\n    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun\'s about to show\n    His colors to the world below,\n    And other birds than those of night\n    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we\'ve done our best;\n    The ebbing tide must do the rest;\n    Now drifting downward to their pier\n    Let barges unassisted steer,\n    While we make haste, with nimble feet,\n    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee\n    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,\n    "I hear the artist does reside\n    Who pictures out, with patient hand,\n    The doings of the Brownie band.""I\'d freely give," another said,\n    "The cap that now protects my head,\n    To find the room, where, day by day,\n    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain\n    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,\n    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more\n    And soon we\'ll reach the office door."[Illustration]\n\n    Then through the park, around the square,\n    And down the broadest thoroughfare,\n    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,\n    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]\n\n        They paused awhile to view the sight,\n        To speak about its age and height,\n        And read the signs, so long and wide,\n        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,\n                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told\n                Their funny actions, free and bold,\n                Was honored by a friendly call\n                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Then what a gallery they found,\n                As here and there they moved around--\n                For now they gaze upon a scene\n                That showed them sporting on the green;\n                Then, hastening o\'er the fields with speed\n                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,\n                Where now we cluster round about,\n                Our doings have been plainly told\n    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there\'s the ink, I apprehend,\n    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,\n    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold\n            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            A telephone gave great delight\n            To those who tried it half the night,\n            Some asking after fresh supplies;\n    Or if their stocks were on the rise;\n    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;\n    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro\n    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known\n    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    "Oh, here\'s the pen, as I opine,"\n    Said one, "that\'s written every line;\n    Indebted to this pen are we\n    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I\'ve found\n    The pointed pencil, long and round,\n    That pictures all our looks so wise,\n            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;\n            \'Tis well it draws us all aright,\n            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name\n            In every region known to fame,\n            To know that children lisp our praise,\n            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew\n    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view\n    In mimic duels on the floor,\n    And snapped at paces three or four;\n    While from the foils the Brownies plied,\n    The sparks in showers scattered wide,\n    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,\n    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash\n    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,\n    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,\n    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]\n\n    They found old shields that bore the dint\n    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,\n    And held them up in proper pose;\n    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]\n\n    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,\n    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,\n    Until the laugh of comrades nigh\n    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,\n    Which every one could recognize:\n    The features, garments, and the style,\n    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,\n    And showed their skill was something rare;\n    While others talked and rummaged through\n    The desk to find the stories new,\n    That told about some late affair,\n    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power\n    To hasten every passing hour,\n    And bring too soon the morning chime,\n    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel\'s brazen bell,\n    The startling hint of morning fell,\n    And Brownies realized the need\n    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street\n    They made their way with nimble feet,\n    And ere the sun could show his face,\n    The band had reached a hiding-place.Morse\'s letter:\n\n                                        North Pole, 10 _January_ 1869.Miss Carrie Richards,\n\n"My Dear Young Friend.--It is very cold here and the pole is covered\nwith ice.I climbed it yesterday to take an observation and arrange our\nflag, the Stars and Stripes, which I hoisted immediately on my arrival\nhere, ten years ago.I thought I should freeze and the pole was so\nslippery that I was in great danger of coming down faster than was\ncomfortable.Although this pole has been used for more than 6,000 years\nit is still as good as new.The works of the Great Architect do not wear\nout.It is now ten years since I have seen you and my other two\nChristian Graces and I have no doubt of your present position among the\nmost brilliant, noble and excellent women in all America.I always knew\nand recognized your great abilities.Nature was very generous to you all\nand you were enjoying fine advantages at the time I last knew you.I\nthought your residence with your Grandparents an admirable school for\nyou, and you and your sister were most evidently the best joy of their\nold age.At the time that I left my\nthree Christian Graces, Mrs.Grundy was sometimes malicious enough to\nsay that they were injuring themselves by flirting.I always told the\nold lady that I had the utmost confidence in the judgment and discretion\nof my pupils and that they would be very careful and prudent in all\ntheir conduct.I confessed that flirting was wrong and very injurious to\nany one who was guilty of it, but I was very sure that you were not.I\ncould not believe that you would disappoint us all and become only\nordinary women, but that you would become the most exalted characters,\nscorning all things unworthy of ladies and Christians and I was right\nand Mrs.When the ice around the pole thaws out I\nshall make a flying visit to Canandaigua.I send you a tame polar bear\nfor a playfellow.This letter will be conveyed to you by Esquimaux\nexpress.--Most truly yours,\n                                                        E.

French and Latin and arithmetic and\nalgebra and geometry and trigonometry and bookkeeping, they would know\nwe had very little time to think of the masculine gender.1860\n\n_New Year\'s Day._--We felt quite grown up to-day and not a little scared\nwhen we saw Mr.Chubbuck all\ncoming in together to make a New Year\'s call.We did not feel so flustrated when Will Schley and Horace Finley\ncame in later.Oliver Phelps, Jr., came to call upon Grandmother._January_ 5.--Abbie Clark and I went up to see Miss Emma Morse because\nit is her birthday.We call her sweet Miss Emma and we think Mr.We went to William Wirt Howe\'s lecture in Bemis Hall\nthis evening.Anna wanted to walk down a little ways with the girls after school so\nshe crouched down between Helen Coy and Hattie Paddock and walked past\nthe house.Grandmother always sits in the front window, so when Anna\ncame in she asked her if she had to stay after school and Anna gave her\nan evasive answer.It reminds me of a story I read, of a lady who told\nthe servant girl if any one called to give an evasive answer as she did\nnot wish to receive calls that day.By and by the door bell rang and the\nservant went to the door.When she came back the lady asked her how she\ndismissed the visitor.She said, "Shure ye towld me to give an evasive\nanswer, so when the man asked if the lady of the house was at home I\nsaid, \'Faith!We never say anything like\nthat to our "dear little lady," but we just change the subject and\ndivert the conversation into a more agreeable channel.To-day some one\ncame to see Grandmother when we were gone and told her that Anna and\nsome others ran away from school.Grandmother told Anna she hoped she\nwould never let any one bring her such a report again.Anna said she\nwould not, if she could possibly help it!Some one\nwho believes in the text, "Look not every man on his own things, but\nevery man also on the things of others."Grandfather told us to-night\nthat we ought to be very careful what we do as we are making history\nevery day.Anna says she shall try not to have hers as dry as some that\nshe had to learn at school to-day._February_ 9.--Dear Miss Mary Howell was married to-day to Mr._February_ 28.--Grandfather asked me to read Abraham Lincoln\'s speech\naloud which he delivered in Cooper Institute, New York, last evening,\nunder the auspices of the Republican Club.He was escorted to the\nplatform by David Dudley Field and introduced by William Cullen Bryant.The _New York Times_ called him "a noted political exhorter and Prairie\norator."It was a thrilling talk and must have stirred men\'s souls._April_ 1.--Aunt Ann was over to see us yesterday and she said she made\na visit the day before out at Mrs.Phelps and\nMiss Eliza Chapin also went and they enjoyed talking over old times when\nthey were young.Maggie Gorham is going to be married on the 25th to Mr.She always said she would not marry a farmer and\nwould not live in a cobblestone house and now she is going to do both,\nfor Mr.Benedict has bought the farm near theirs and it has a\ncobblestone house.We have always thought her one of the jolliest and\nprettiest of the older set of young ladies._June._--James writes that he has seen the Prince of Wales in New York.He was up on the roof of the Continental Fire Insurance building, out on\nthe cornice, and looked down on the procession.Afterwards there was a\nreception for the Prince at the University Law School and James saw him\nclose by.He says he has a very pleasant youthful face.There was a ball\ngiven for him one evening in the Academy of Music and there were 3,000\npresent.The ladies who danced with him will never forget it.They say\nthat he enters into every diversion which is offered to him with the\ngreatest tact and good nature, and when he visited Mount Vernon he\nshowed great reverence for the memory of George Washington.He attended\na literary entertainment in Boston, where Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson,\nThoreau, and other Americans of distinction were presented to him.He\nwill always be a favorite in America.Annie Granger asked Anna and me to come over to her house\nand see her baby.We were very eager to go and wanted to hold it and\ncarry it around the room.She was willing but asked us if we had any\npins on us anywhere.She said she had the nurse sew the baby\'s clothes\non every morning so that if she cried she would know whether it was\npains or pins.We said we had no pins on us, so we stayed quite a while\nand held little Miss Hattie to our heart\'s content.She is named for her\naunt, Hattie Granger.Anna says she thinks Miss Martha Morse will give\nmedals to her and Mary Daggett for being the most meddlesome girls in\nschool, judging from the number of times she has spoken to them to-day.Anna is getting to be a regular punster, although I told her that\nBlair\'s Rhetoric says that punning is not the highest kind of wit.Morse met us coming from school in the rain and said it would not hurt\nus as we were neither sugar nor salt.Anna said, "No, but we are\n\'lasses."Grandmother has been giving us sulphur and molasses for the\npurification of the blood and we have to take it three mornings and then\nskip three mornings.This morning Anna commenced going through some sort\nof gymnastics and Grandmother asked her what she was doing, and she said\nit was her first morning to skip.Abbie Clark had a large tea-party this afternoon and evening--Seminary\ngirls and a few Academy boys.We had a fine supper and then played\ngames.Abbie gave us one which is a test of memory and we tried to learn\nit from her but she was the only one who could complete it.I can write\nit down, but not say it:\n\nA good fat hen.Three plump partridges, two ducks and a good fat hen.Four squawking wild geese, three plump partridges, etc.Six pairs of Don Alfonso\'s tweezers.Seven hundred rank and file Macedonian horsemen drawn up in line of\nbattle.Eight cages of heliogabalus sparrow kites.Nine sympathetical, epithetical, categorical propositions.Eleven flat bottom fly boats sailing between Madagascar and Mount\nPalermo.Twelve European dancing masters, sent to teach the Egyptian mummies how\nto dance, against Hercules\' wedding day.Abbie says it was easier to learn than the multiplication table.They\nwanted some of us to recite and Abbie Clark gave us Lowell\'s poem, "John\nP. Robinson, he, says the world\'ll go right if he only says Gee!"I gave\nanother of Lowell\'s poems, "The Courtin\'."Julia Phelps had her guitar\nwith her by request and played and sang for us very sweetly.Fred\nHarrington went home with her and Theodore Barnum with me._Sunday._--Frankie Richardson asked me to go with her to teach a class\nin the  Sunday School on Chapel Street this afternoon.I asked\nGrandmother if I could go and she said she never noticed that I was\nparticularly interested in the <DW52> race and she said she thought I\nonly wanted an excuse to get out for a walk Sunday afternoon.However,\nshe said I could go just this once.When we got up as far as the\nAcademy, Mr.Noah T. Clarke\'s brother, who is one of the teachers, came\nout and Frank said he led the singing at the Sunday School and she said\nshe would give me an introduction to him, so he walked up with us and\nhome again.Grandmother said that when she saw him opening the gate for\nme, she understood my zeal in missionary work."The dear little lady,"\nas we often call her, has always been noted for her keen discernment and\nwonderful sagacity and loses none of it as she advances in years.Some\none asked Anna the other day if her Grandmother retained all her\nfaculties and Anna said, "Yes, indeed, to an alarming degree."Grandmother knows that we think she is a perfect angel even if she does\nseem rather strict sometimes.Whether we are 7 or 17 we are children to\nher just the same, and the Bible says, "Children obey your parents in\nthe Lord for this is right."We are glad that we never will seem old to\nher.I had the same company home from church in the evening._Monday._--This morning the cook went to early mass and Anna told\nGrandmother she would bake the pancakes for breakfast if she would let\nher put on gloves.She would not let her, so Hannah baked the cakes.I\nwas invited to Mary Paul\'s to supper to-night and drank the first cup of\ntea I ever drank in my life.I had a very nice time and Johnnie Paul\ncame home with me.Imogen Power and I went down together Friday afternoon to buy me a\nMeteorology.We are studying that and Watts on the Mind, instead of\nPhilosophy._Tuesday._--I went with Fanny Gaylord to see Mrs.Callister at the hotel\nto-night.She is so interested in all that we tell her, just like "one\nof the girls."[Illustration: The Old Canandaigua Academy]\n\nI was laughing to-day when I came in from the street and Grandmother\nasked me what amused me so.Putnam on\nthe street and she looked so immense and he so minute I couldn\'t help\nlaughing at the contrast.Grandmother said that size was not everything,\nand then she quoted Cowper\'s verse:\n\n    "Were I so tall to reach the skies or grasp the ocean in a span,\n    I must be measured by my soul, the mind is the stature of the man."_Friday._--We went to Monthly Concert of prayer for Foreign Missions\nthis evening.I told Grandmother that I thought it was not very\ninteresting.Judge Taylor read the _Missionary Herald_ about the\nMadagascans and the Senegambians and the Terra del Fuegans and then\nDeacon Tyler prayed and they sang "From Greenland\'s Icy Mountains" and\ntook up a collection and went home.She said she was afraid I did not\nlisten attentively.I don\'t think I did strain every nerve.I believe\nGrandmother will give her last cent to Missions if the Boards get into\nworse straits than they are now.In Latin class to-day Anna translated the phrase Deo Volente "with\nviolence," and Mr.Tyler, who always enjoys a joke, laughed so, we\nthought he would fall out of his chair.He evidently thought it was the\nbest one he had heard lately._November_ 21.--Aunt Ann gave me a sewing bird to screw on to the table\nto hold my work instead of pinning it to my knee.Grandmother tells us\nwhen we sew or read not to get everything around us that we will want\nfor the next two hours because it is not healthy to sit in one position\nso long.She wants us to get up and "stir around."Anna does not need\nthis advice as much as I do for she is always on what Miss Achert calls\nthe "qui vive."I am trying to make a sofa pillow out of little pieces\nof silk.You have to cut pieces of paper into\noctagonal shape and cover them with silk and then sew them together,\nover and over.They are beautiful, with bright colors, when they are\ndone.There was a hop at the hotel last night and some of the girls went\nand had an elegant time.Hiram Metcalf came here this morning to\nhave Grandmother sign some papers.He always looks very dignified, and\nAnna and I call him "the deed man."We tried to hear what he said to\nGrandmother after she signed her name but we only heard something about\n"fear or compulsion" and Grandmother said "yes."Grandfather took us down street to-day to see the new Star\nBuilding.It was the town house and he bought it and got Mr.Warren\nStoddard of Hopewell to superintend cutting it in two and moving the\nparts separately to Coach Street.When it was completed the shout went\nup from the crowd, "Hurrah for Thomas Beals, the preserver of the old\nCourt House."No one but Grandfather thought it could be done._December._--I went with the girls to the lake to skate this afternoon.Johnson, the <DW52> barber, is the best skater in town.He can\nskate forwards and backwards and cut all sorts of curlicues, although he\nis such a heavy man.He is going to Liberia and there his skates won\'t\ndo him any good.I wish he would give them to me and also his skill to\nuse them.Some one asked me to sit down after I got home and I said I\npreferred to stand, as I had been sitting down all the afternoon!Gus\nColeman took a load of us sleigh-riding this evening.Of course he had\nClara Willson sit on the front seat with him and help him drive._Thursday._--We had a special meeting of our society this evening at\nMary Wheeler\'s and invited the gentlemen and had charades and general\ngood time.Gillette and Horace Finley made a great deal of fun for\nus.Gillette into the Dorcas Society, which consists in\nseating the candidate in a chair and propounding some very solemn\nquestions and then in token of desire to join the society, you ask him\nto open his mouth very wide for a piece of cake which you swallow,\nyourself, instead!We went to a concert at the Seminary this evening.Miss Mollie Bull sang\n"Coming Through the Rye" and Miss Lizzie Bull sang "Annie Laurie" and\n"Auld Lang Syne."Jennie Lind, herself, could not have done better._December_ 15.--Alice Jewett, Emma Wheeler and Anna are in Mrs.Worthington\'s Sunday School class and as they have recently united with\nthe church, she thought they should begin practical Christian work by\ndistributing tracts among the neglected classes.So this afternoon they\nran away from school to begin the good work.It was so bright and\npleasant, they thought a walk to the lake would be enjoyable and they\ncould find a welcome in some humble home.The girls wanted Anna to be\nthe leader, but she would only promise that if something pious came into\nher mind, she would say it.They knocked at a door and were met by a\nsmiling mother of twelve children and asked to come in.They sat down\nfeeling somewhat embarrassed, but spying a photograph album on the\ntable, they became much interested, while the children explained the\npictures.Finally Anna felt that it was time to do something, so when no\none was looking, she slipped under one of the books on the table, three\ntracts entitled "Consolation for the Bereaved," "Systematic Benevolence"\nand "The Social Evils of dancing, card playing and theater-going."Then\nthey said goodbye to their new friends and started on.They decided not\nto do any more pastoral work until another day, but enjoyed the outing\nvery much._Christmas._--We all went to Aunt Mary Carr\'s to dinner excepting\nGrandmother, and in the evening we went to see some tableaux at Dr.We were very much pleased with\nthe entertainment.del Pratt, one of the patients,\nsaid every time, "What next!"Grandfather was requested to add his picture to the gallery of portraits\nof eminent men for the Court Room, so he has had it painted.An artist\nby the name of Green, who lives in town, has finished it after numerous\nsittings and brought it up for our approval.We like it but we do not\nthink it is as good looking as he is.No one could really satisfy us\nprobably, so we may as well try to be suited.Clarke could take Sunday night supper with us\nand she said she was afraid he did not know the catechism.I asked him\nFriday night and he said he would learn it on Saturday so that he could\nanswer every third question any way.1861\n\n_March_ 4, 1861.--President Lincoln was inaugurated to-day._March_ 5.--I read the inaugural address aloud to Grandfather this\nevening.He dwelt with such pathos upon the duty that all, both North\nand South, owe to the Union, it does not seem as though there could be\nwar!_April._--We seem to have come to a sad, sad time.The Bible says, "A\nman\'s worst foes are those of his own household."The whole United\nStates has been like one great household for many years."United we\nstand, divided we fall!"has been our watchword, but some who should\nhave been its best friends have proven false and broken the bond.Men\nare taking sides, some for the North, some for the South.Hot words and\nfierce looks have followed, and there has been a storm in the air for a\nlong time._April_ 15.--The storm has broken upon us.The Confederates fired on\nFort Sumter, just off the coast of South Carolina, and forced her on\nApril 14 to haul down the flag and surrender.President Lincoln has\nissued a call for 75,000 men and many are volunteering to go all around\nus._May,_ 1861.--Many of the young men are going from Canandaigua and all\nthe neighboring towns.It seems very patriotic and grand when they are\nsinging, "It is sweet, Oh, \'tis sweet, for one\'s country to die," and we\nhear the martial music and see the flags flying and see the recruiting\ntents on the square and meet men in uniform at every turn and see train\nloads of the boys in blue going to the front, but it will not seem so\ngrand if we hear they are dead on the battlefield, far from home.A lot\nof us girls went down to the train and took flowers to the soldiers as\nthey were passing through and they cut buttons from their coats and gave\nto us as souvenirs.We have flags on our paper and envelopes, and have\nall our stationery bordered with red, white and blue.We wear little\nflag pins for badges and tie our hair with red, white and blue ribbon\nand have pins and earrings made of the buttons the soldiers gave us.We\nare going to sew for them in our society and get the garments all cut\nfrom the older ladies\' society.They work every day in one of the rooms\nof the court house and cut out garments and make them and scrape lint\nand roll up bandages.They say they will provide us with all the\ngarments we will make.We are going to write notes and enclose them in\nthe garments to cheer up the soldier boys.It does not seem now as\nthough I could give up any one who belonged to me.The girls in our\nsociety say that if any of the members do send a soldier to the war they\nshall have a flag bed quilt, made by the society, and have the girls\'\nnames on the stars._May_ 20.--I recited "Scott and the Veteran" to-day at school, and Mary\nField recited, "To Drum Beat and Heart Beat a Soldier Marches By"; Anna\nrecited "The Virginia Mother."There was a patriotic rally in Bemis Hall last night and a quartette\nsang, "The Sword of Bunker Hill" and "Dixie" and "John Brown\'s Body Lies\na Mouldering in the Grave," and many other patriotic songs.We have one\nWest Point cadet, Albert M. Murray, who is in the thick of the fight,\nand Charles S. Coy represents Canandaigua in the navy.[Illustration: The Ontario Female Seminary]\n\n_June,_ 1861.--At the anniversary exercises, Rev.Samuel M. Hopkins of\nAuburn gave the address.I have graduated from Ontario Female Seminary\nafter a five years course and had the honor of receiving a diploma from\nthe courtly hands of General John A. Granger.I am going to have it\nframed and handed down to my grandchildren as a memento, not exactly of\nsleepless nights and midnight vigils, but of rising betimes, at what\nAnna calls the crack of dawn.She likes that expression better than\ndaybreak.I heard her reciting in the back chamber one morning about 4\no\'clock and listened at the door.She was saying in the most nonchalant\nmanner: "Science and literature in England were fast losing all traces\nof originality, invention was discouraged, research unvalued and the\nexamination of nature proscribed.It seemed to be generally supposed\nthat the treasure accumulated in the preceding ages was quite sufficient\nfor all national purposes and that the only duty which authors had to\nperform was to reproduce what had thus been accumulated, adorned with\nall the graces of polished style.Tameness and monotony naturally result\nfrom a slavish adherence to all arbitrary rules and every branch of\nliterature felt this blighting influence.History, perhaps, was in some\ndegree an exception, for Hume, Robertson and more especially Gibbon,\nexhibited a spirit of original investigation which found no parallel\namong their contemporaries."I looked in and asked her where her book\nwas, and she said she left it down stairs.She has "got it" all right, I\nam sure.We helped decorate the seminary chapel for two days.Our motto\nwas, "Still achieving, still pursuing."Miss Guernsey made most of the\nletters and Mr.Chubbuck put them up and he hung all the paintings.General Granger had to use his palm leaf fan all\nthe time, as well as the rest of us.There were six in our class, Mary\nField, Lucy Petherick, Kate Lilly, Sarah Clay, Abby Scott and myself.Abbie Clark would have been in the class, but she went to Pittsfield,\nMass., instead.General Granger said to each one of us, "It gives me\ngreat pleasure to present you with this diploma," and when he gave Miss\nScott hers, as she is from Alabama, he said he wished it might be as a\nflag of truce between the North and the South, and this sentiment was\nloudly cheered.General Granger looked so handsome with his black dress\nsuit and ruffled shirt front and all the natural grace which belongs to\nhim.The sheepskin has a picture of the Seminary on it and this\ninscription: "The Trustees and Faculty of the Ontario Female Seminary\nhereby certify that __________ has completed the course of study\nprescribed in this Institution, maintained the requisite scholarship and\ncommendable deportment and is therefore admitted to the graduating\nhonors of this Institution.President of Board, John A. Granger;\nBenjamin F. Richards, Edward G. Tyler, Principals."Morse wrote\nsomething for the paper:\n\n"To the Editor of the Repository:\n\n"Dear Sir--June roses, etc., make our loveliest of villages a paradise\nthis week.The constellations are all glorious and the stars of earth\nfar outshine those of the heavens.The lake shore, \'Lovers\' Lane,\' \'Glen\nKitty\' and the \'Points\' are full of romance and romancers.The yellow\nmoon and the blue waters and the dark green shores and the petrified\nIndians, whispering stony words at the foot of Genundewah, and Squaw\nIsland sitting on the waves, like an enchanted grove, and \'Whalesback\'\nall humped up in the East and \'Devil\'s Lookout\' rising over all, made\nthe \'Sleeping Beauty\' a silver sea of witchery and love; and in the\ncottages and palaces we ate the ambrosia and drank the nectar of the\nsweet goddesses of this new and golden age."I may as well say to you, Mr.Editor, that the Ontario Female Seminary\nclosed yesterday and \'Yours truly\' was present at the commencement.Being a bachelor I shall plead guilty and appeal to the mercy of the\nCourt, if indicted for undue prejudice in favor of the charming young\norators.After the report of the Examining Committee, in which the\nscholarship of the young ladies was not too highly praised, came the\nLatin Salutatory by Miss Clay, a most beautiful and elegant production\n(that sentence, sir, applies to both salutatory and salutatorian).The\n\'Shadows We Cast,\' by Miss Field, carried us far into the beautiful\nfields of nature and art and we saw the dark, or the brilliant shades,\nwhich our lives will cast, upon society and history.Then \'Tongues in\nTrees\' began to whisper most bewitchingly, and \'Books in the Running\nBrooks\' were opened, and \'Sermons in Stones\' were preached by Miss\nRichards, and this old bachelor thought if all trees would talk so well,\nand every brook would babble so musically, and each precious stone would\nexhort so brilliantly, as they were made to do by the \'enchantress,\'\nangels and dreams would henceforth be of little consequence; and whether\nthe orator should be called \'Tree of Beauty,\' \'Minnehaha\' or the\n\'Kohinoor\' is a\'vexata questio.\'Hardick, \'our own,\' whose hand never touches the\npiano without making delicious music, and Misses Daggett and Wilson,\nalso \'our own,\' and the musical pupils of the Institution, gave a\nconcert.\'The Young Volunteer\' was imperatively demanded, and this for\nthe third time during the anniversary exercises, and was sung amid\nthunders of applause, \'Star of the South,\' Miss Stella Scott, shining\nmeanwhile in all her radiant beauty.May her glorious light soon rest on\na Union that shall never more be broken.--Soberly yours,\n\n                                                A Very Old Bachelor."_June,_ 1861.--There was a patriotic rally this afternoon on the campus\nof Canandaigua Academy and we Seminary girls went.They raised a flag on\nthe Academy building.Coleman led the\nchoir and they sang "The Star Spangled Banner."Noah T. Clarke made\na stirring speech and Mr.Gideon Granger, James C. Smith and E. M. Morse\nfollowed.Canandaigua has already raised over $7,000 for the war.Barry drills the Academy boys in military tactics on the campus every\nday.Lester P. Thompson, son of "Father\nThompson," among the others.A young man asked Anna to take a drive to-day, but Grandmother was not\nwilling at first to let her go.She finally gave her consent, after\nAnna\'s plea that he was so young and his horse was so gentle.Just as\nthey were ready to start, I heard Anna run upstairs and I heard him say,\n"What an Anna!"I asked her afterwards what she went for and she said\nshe remembered that she had left the soap in the water.Daggett\'s war sermon from the 146th Psalm was wonderful.He had a stroke of paralysis two weeks\nago and for several days he has been unconscious.The choir of our\nchurch, of which he was leader for so long, and some of the young people\ncame and stood around his bed and sang, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul."They\ndid not know whether he was conscious or not, but they thought so\nbecause the tears ran down his cheeks from his closed eyelids, though he\ncould not speak or move.Daggett\'s text was, "The Beloved Physician."1862\n\n_January_ 26.--We went to the Baptist Church this evening to hear Rev.A. H. Lung preach his last sermon before going into the army._February_ 17.--Glorious news from the war to-day.Fort Donelson is\ntaken with 1,500 rebels._February_ 21.--Our society met at Fanny Palmer\'s this afternoon.I went\nbut did not stay to tea as we were going to Madame Anna Bishop\'s concert\nin the evening.Her voice has great\nscope and she was dressed in the latest stage costume, but it took so\nmuch material for her skirt that there was hardly any left for the\nwaist.[Illustration: "Old Friend Burling", Madame Anna Bishop]\n\n_Washington\'s Birthday._--Patriotic services were held in the\nCongregational Church this morning.Madame Anna Bishop sang, and\nNational songs were sung.James C. Smith read Washington\'s Farewell\nAddress.In the afternoon a party of twenty-two, young and old, took a\nride in the Seminary boat and went to Mr.Paton\'s on the lake shore\nroad.We carried flags and made it a patriotic occasion.I sat next to\nSpencer F. Lincoln, a young man from Naples who is studying law in Mr.I never met him before but he told me he had\nmade up his mind to go to the war.It is wonderful that young men who\nhave brilliant prospects before them at home, will offer themselves upon\nthe altar of their country.There\nis a picture of the flag on the envelope and underneath, "If any one\nattempts to haul down the American flag shoot him on the spot.--\nJohn A._Sunday, February_ 23.--Everybody came out to church this morning,\nexpecting to hear Madame Anna Bishop sing.She was not there, and an\n"agent" made a "statement."The audience did not appear particularly\nedified._March_ 4.--John B. Gough lectured in Bemis Hall last night and was\nentertained by Governor Clark.I told Grandfather that I had an\ninvitation to the lecture and he asked me who from.He did not make the least objection and I was\nawfully glad, because he has asked me to the whole course.Wendell\nPhillips and Horace Greeley, E. H. Chapin and John G. Saxe and Bayard\nTaylor are expected.John B. Gough\'s lecture was fine.He can make an\naudience laugh as much by wagging his coat tails as some men can by\ntalking an hour._March_ 26.--I have been up at Laura Chapin\'s from 10 o\'clock in the\nmorning until 10 at night, finishing Jennie Howell\'s bed quilt, as she\nis to be married very soon.We\nfinished it at 8 p. m. and when we took it off the frames we gave three\ncheers.Some of the youth of the village came up to inspect our\nhandiwork and see us home.Before we went Julia Phelps sang and played\non the guitar and Captain Barry also sang and we all sang together, "O!Columbia, the gem of the ocean, three cheers for the red, white and\nblue."_June_ 19.--Our cousin, Ann Eliza Field, was married to-day to George B.\nBates at her home on Gibson Street.Charlie Wheeler made great fun and threw the final shower of rice as\nthey drove away._June._--There was great excitement in prayer meeting last night, it\nseemed to Abbie Clark, Mary Field and me on the back seat where we\nalways sit.Several people have asked us why we sit away back there by\nold Mrs.Kinney, but we tell them that she sits on the other side of the\nstove from us and we like the seat, because we have occupied it so long.I presume we would see less and hear more if we sat in front.Walter Hubbell had made one of his most beautiful prayers\nand Mr.Cyrus Dixon was praying, a big June bug came zipping into the\nroom and snapped against the wall and the lights and barely escaped\nseveral bald heads.Anna kept dodging around in a most startling manner\nand I expected every moment to see her walk out and take Emma Wheeler\nwith her, for if she is afraid of anything more than dogs it is June\nbugs.At this crisis the bug flew out and a cat stealthily walked in.Taylor was always unpleasantly affected by the sight\nof cats and we didn\'t know what would happen if the cat should go near\nher.The cat very innocently ascended the steps to the desk and as Judge\nand Mrs.Taylor always sit on the front seat, she couldn\'t help\nobserving the ambitious animal as it started to assist Dr.Daggett in\nconducting the meeting.Taylor just managed to\nreach the outside door before fainting away.We were glad when the\nbenediction was pronounced._June._--Anna and I had a serenade last night from the Academy Glee\nClub, I think, as their voices sounded familiar.We were awakened by the\nmusic, about 11 p. m., quite suddenly and I thought I would step across\nthe hall to the front chamber for a match to light the candle.I was\nonly half awake, however, and lost my bearings and stepped off the\nstairs and rolled or slid to the bottom.The stairs are winding, so I\nmust have performed two or three revolutions before I reached my\ndestination.I jumped up and ran back and found Anna sitting up in bed,\nlaughing.She asked me where I had been and said if I had only told her\nwhere I was going she would have gone for me.We decided not to strike a\nlight, but just listen to the singing.Anna said she was glad that the\nleading tenor did not know how quickly I "tumbled" to the words of his\nsong, "O come my love and be my own, nor longer let me dwell alone," for\nshe thought he would be too much flattered.Grandfather came into the\nhall and asked if any bones were broken and if he should send for a\ndoctor.We told him we guessed not, we thought we would be all right in\nthe morning.He thought it was Anna who fell down stairs, as he is never\nlooking for such exploits in me.We girls received some verses from the\nAcademy boys, written by Greig Mulligan, under the assumed name of Simon\nSnooks.The subject was, "The Poor Unfortunate Academy Boys."We have\nanswered them and now I fear Mrs.Grundy will see them and imagine\nsomething serious is going on.But she is mistaken and will find, at the\nend of the session, our hearts are still in our own possession.When we were down at Sucker Brook the other afternoon we were watching\nthe water and one of the girls said, "How nice it would be if our lives\ncould run along as smoothly as this stream."I said I thought it would\nbe too monotonous.Laura Chapin said she supposed I would rather have an\n"eddy" in mine.We went to the examination at the Academy to-day and to the gymnasium\nexercises afterwards.Noah T. Clarke\'s brother leads them and they\ndo some great feats with their rings and swings and weights and ladders.We girls can do a few in the bowling alley at the Seminary._June._--I visited Eureka Lawrence in Syracuse and we attended\ncommencement at Hamilton College, Clinton, and saw there, James\nTunnicliff and Stewart Ellsworth of Penn Yan.I also saw Darius Sackett\nthere among the students and also became acquainted with a very\ninteresting young man from Syracuse, with the classic name of Horace\nPublius Virgilius Bogue.Both of these young men are studying for the\nministry.I also saw Henry P. Cook, who used to be one of the Academy\nboys, and Morris Brown, of Penn Yan.They talk of leaving college and\ngoing to the war and so does Darius Sackett._July,_ 1862.--The President has called for 300,000 more brave men to\nfill up the ranks of the fallen.We hear every day of more friends and\nacquaintances who have volunteered to go._August_ 20.--The 126th Regiment, just organized, was mustered into\nservice at Camp Swift, Geneva.Those that I know who belong to it are\nColonel E. S. Sherrill, Lieutenant Colonel James M. Bull, Captain\nCharles A. Richardson, Captain Charles M. Wheeler, Captain Ten Eyck\nMunson, Captain Orin G. Herendeen, Surgeon Dr.Charles S. Hoyt, Hospital\nSteward Henry T. Antes, First Lieutenant Charles Gage, Second Lieutenant\nSpencer F. Lincoln, First Sergeant Morris Brown, Corporal Hollister N.\nGrimes, Privates Darius Sackett, Henry Willson, Oliver Castle, William\nLamport.Hoyt wrote home: "God bless the dear ones we leave behind; and while\nyou try to perform the duties you owe to each other, we will try to\nperform ours."We saw by the papers that the volunteers of the regiment before leaving\ncamp at Geneva allotted over $15,000 of their monthly pay to their\nfamilies and friends at home.One soldier sent this telegram to his\nwife, as the regiment started for the front: "God bless you._August._--The New York State S. S. convention is convened here and the\nmeetings are most interesting.They were held in our church and lasted\nthree days.Hart, from New York, led the singing and Mr.Noah T. Clarke was in his element all through\nthe meetings.Pardee gave some fine blackboard exercises.Tousley was wheeled into the church, in his invalid\nchair, and said a few words, which thrilled every one.So much\ntenderness, mingled with his old time enthusiasm and love for the cause.It is the last time probably that his voice will ever be heard in\npublic.They closed the grand meeting with the hymn beginning:\n\n    "Blest be the tie that binds\n    Our hearts in Christian love."In returning thanks to the people of Canandaigua for their generous\nentertainment, Mr.Ralph Wells facetiously said that the cost of the\nconvention must mean something to Canandaigua people, for the cook in\none home was heard to say, "These religiouses do eat awful!"_September_ 13.--Darius Sackett was wounded by a musket shot in the leg,\nat Maryland Heights, Va., and in consequence is discharged from the\nservice._September._--Edgar A. Griswold of Naples is recruiting a company here\nfor the 148th Regiment, of which he is captain.Hiram P. Brown, Henry S.\nMurray and Charles H. Paddock are officers in the company.Elnathan\nW. Simmons is surgeon._September_ 22.--I read aloud to Grandfather this evening the\nEmancipation Proclamation issued as a war measure by President Lincoln,\nto take effect January 1, liberating over three million slaves.He\nrecommends to all thus set free, to labor faithfully for reasonable\nwages and to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary\nself-defense, and he invokes upon this act "the considerate judgment of\nmankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God."_November_ 21.--This is my twentieth birthday.Anna wanted to write a\npoem for the occasion and this morning she handed me what she called "An\neffort."She said she wrestled with it all night long and could not\nsleep and this was the result:\n\n    "One hundred years from now, Carrie dear,\n    In all probability you\'ll not be here;\n    But we\'ll all be in the same boat, too,\n    And there\'ll be no one left\n    To say boo hoo!"Grandfather gave me for a present a set of books called "Irving\'s\nCatechisms on Ancient Greeks and Romans."They are four little books\nbound in leather, which were presented to our mother for a prize.It is\nthus inscribed on the front page, "Miss Elizabeth Beals at a public\nexamination of the Female Boarding School in East Bloomfield, October\n15, 1825, was judged to excel the school in Reading.In testimony of\nwhich she receives this Premium from her affectionate instructress, S.I cannot imagine Grandmother sending us away to boarding school, but I\nsuppose she had so many children then, she could spare one or two as\nwell as not.She says they sent Aunt Ann to Miss Willard\'s school at\nTroy.She wants\nto know how everything goes at the Seminary and if Anna still occupies\nthe front seat in the school room most of the time.She says she\nsupposes she is quite a sedate young lady now but she hopes there is a\nwhole lot of the old Anna left.William H. Lamport went down to Virginia to see his\nson and found that he had just died in the hospital from measles and\npneumonia.1863\n\n_January._--Grandmother went to Aunt Mary Carr\'s to tea to-night, very\nmuch to our surprise, for she seldom goes anywhere.Anna said she was\ngoing to keep house exactly as Grandmother did, so after supper she took\na little hot water in a basin on a tray and got the tea-towels and\nwashed the silver and best china but she let the ivory handles on the\nknives and forks get wet, so I presume they will all turn black.Grandmother never lets her little nice things go out into the kitchen,\nso probably that is the reason that everything is forty years old and\nyet as good as new.She let us have the Young Ladies\' Aid Society here\nto supper because I am President.She came into the parlor and looked at\nour basket of work, which the elder ladies cut out for us to make for\nthe soldiers.She had the supper table set the whole length of the\ndining room and let us preside at the table.Anna made the girls laugh\nso, they could hardly eat, although they said everything was splendid.They said they never ate better biscuit, preserves, or fruit cake and\nthe coffee was delicious.After it was over, the "dear little lady" said\nshe hoped we had a good time.After the girls were gone Grandmother\nwanted to look over the garments and see how much we had accomplished\nand if we had made them well.Mary Field made a pair of drawers with No.She said she wanted them to look fine and I am sure they did.Most of us wrote notes and put inside the garments for the soldiers in\nthe hospitals.Sarah Gibson Howell has had an answer to her letter.His name is\nFoster--a Major.She expects him to come and see her soon.All the girls wear newspaper bustles to school now and Anna\'s rattled\nto-day and Emma Wheeler heard it and said, "What\'s the news, Anna?"They\nboth laughed out loud and found that "the latest news from the front"\nwas that Miss Morse kept them both after school and they had to copy\nDictionary for an hour.I paid $3.50 to-day for\na hoop skirt.T. Barnum delivered his lecture on "The Art of Money\nGetting" in Bemis Hall this evening for the benefit of the Ladies\' Aid\nSociety, which is working for the soldiers._February._--The members of our society sympathized with General\nMcClellan when he was criticised by some and we wrote him the following\nletter:\n\n                                            "Canandaigua, Feb.McClellan:\n\n"Will you pardon any seeming impropriety in our addressing you, and\nattribute it to the impulsive love and admiration of hearts which see in\nyou, the bravest and noblest defender of our Union.We cannot resist the\nimpulse to tell you, be our words ever so feeble, how our love and trust\nhave followed you from Rich Mountain to Antietam, through all slanderous\nattacks of traitorous politicians and fanatical defamers--how we have\nadmired, not less than your calm courage on the battlefield, your lofty\nscorn of those who remained at home in the base endeavor to strip from\nyour brow the hard earned laurels placed there by a grateful country: to\ntell further, that in your forced retirement from battlefields of the\nRepublic\'s peril, you have \'but changed your country\'s arms for\nmore,--your country\'s heart,\'--and to assure you that so long as our\ncountry remains to us a sacred name and our flag a holy emblem, so long\nshall we cherish your memory as the defender and protector of both.We\nare an association whose object it is to aid, in the only way in which\nwoman, alas!Our sympathies are with\nthem in the cause for which they have periled all--our hearts are with\nthem in the prayer, that ere long their beloved commander may be\nrestored to them, and that once more as of old he may lead them to\nvictory in the sacred name of the Union and Constitution."With united prayers that the Father of all may have you and yours ever\nin His holy keeping, we remain your devoted partisans."The following in reply was addressed to the lady whose name was first\nsigned to the above:\n\n                                               "New York, Feb.Madam--I take great pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of the very\nkind letter of the 13th inst., from yourself and your friends.Will you\ndo me the favor to say to them how much I thank them for it, and that I\nam at a loss to express my gratitude for the pleasant and cheering terms\nin which it is couched.Such sentiments on the part of those whose\nbrothers have served with me in the field are more grateful to me than\nanything else can be.I feel far more than rewarded by them for all I\nhave tried to accomplish.--I am, Madam, with the most sincere respect\nand friendship, yours very truly,\n\n                                                    Geo._May._--A number of the teachers and pupils of the Academy have enlisted\nfor the war.Among them E.

Clarke\'s mother in\nNaples.She had already sent three sons, Bela, William and Joseph, to\nthe war and she is very sad because her youngest has now enlisted.She\nsays she feels as did Jacob of old when he said, "I am bereaved of my\nchildren.Joseph is not and Simeon is not and now you will take Benjamin\naway."I have heard that she is a beautiful singer but she says she\ncannot sing any more until this cruel war is over.I wish that I could\nwrite something to comfort her but I feel as Mrs.Browning puts it: "If\nyou want a song for your Italy free, let none look at me."Our society met at Fannie Pierce\'s this afternoon.Her mother is an\ninvalid and never gets out at all, but she is very much interested in\nthe soldiers and in all young people, and loves to have us come in and\nsee her and we love to go.She enters into the plans of all of us young\ngirls and has a personal interest in us.We had a very good time\nto-night and Laura Chapin was more full of fun than usual.Once there\nwas silence for a minute or two and some one said, "awful pause."Laura\nsaid, "I guess you would have awful paws if you worked as hard as I do."We were talking about how many of us girls would be entitled to flag bed\nquilts, and according to the rules, they said that, up to date, Abbie\nClark and I were the only ones.The explanation is that Captain George\nN. Williams and Lieutenant E. C. Clarke are enlisted in their country\'s\nservice.Susie Daggett is Secretary and Treasurer of the Society and she\nreported that in one year\'s time we made in our society 133 pairs of\ndrawers, 101 shirts, 4 pairs socks for soldiers, and 54 garments for the\nfamilies of soldiers.Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day for two young braves\nwho are going to the war.William H.

Y. Volunteers.Morse\'s lecture, "You and I": "And who has forgotten that\ngifted youth, who fell on the memorable field of Gettysburg?To win a\nnoble name, to save a beloved country, he took his place beneath the\ndear old flag, and while cannon thundered and sabers clashed and the\nstars of the old Union shone above his head he went down in the shock of\nbattle and left us desolate, a name to love and a glory to endure.And\nas we solemnly know, as by the old charter of liberty we most sacredly\nswear, he was truly and faithfully and religiously\n\n    Of all our friends the noblest,\n    The choicest and the purest,\n    The nearest and the dearest,\n      In the field at Gettysburg.Of all the heroes bravest,\n    Of soul the brightest, whitest,\n    Of all the warriors greatest,\n      Shot dead at Gettysburg.And where the fight was thickest,\n    And where the smoke was blackest,\n    And where the fire was hottest,\n      On the fields of Gettysburg,\n    There flashed his steel the brightest,\n    There blazed his eyes the fiercest,\n    There flowed his blood the reddest\n      On the field of Gettysburg.O music of the waters\n      That flow at Gettysburg,\n    Mourn tenderly the hero,\n    The rare and glorious hero,\n    The loved and peerless hero,\n      Who died at Gettysburg.His turf shall be the greenest,\n    His roses bloom the sweetest,\n    His willow droop the saddest\n      Of all at Gettysburg.His memory live the freshest,\n    His fame be cherished longest,\n    Of all the holy warriors,\n      Who fell at Gettysburg.These were patriots, these were our jewels.And of every soldier who has fallen in this war his friends may\nwrite just as lovingly as you and I may do of those to whom I pay my\nfeeble tribute."_August,_ 1863.--The U.

wants me to come to see her in her New York home._November_ 19.--We wish we were at Gettysburg to-day to hear President\nLincoln\'s and Edward Everett\'s addresses at the dedication of the\nNational Cemetery.We will read them in to-morrow\'s papers, but it will\nnot be like hearing them._Author\'s Note,_ 1911.--Forty-eight years have elapsed since Lincoln\'s\nspeech was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers\' Cemetery at\nGettysburg.So eloquent and remarkable was his utterance that I believe\nI am correct in stating that every word spoken has now been translated\ninto all known languages and is regarded as one of the World Classics.The same may be said of Lincoln\'s letter to the mother of five sons lost\nin battle.I make no apology for inserting in this place both the speech\nand the letter.Whitelaw Reid, the American Ambassador to Great\nBritain, in an address on Lincoln delivered at the University of\nBirmingham in December, 1910, remarked in reference to this letter,\n"What classic author in our common English tongue has surpassed that?"and next may I ask, "What English or American orator has on a similar\noccasion surpassed this address on the battlefield of Gettysburg?""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this\ncontinent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the\nproposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a\ngreat civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived\nand so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a great battlefield of\nthat war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final\nresting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might\nlive.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But in\na larger sense we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot\nhallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here\nhave consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.The\nworld will little note, nor long remember, what we say here--but it can\nnever forget what they did here.It is for us, the living, rather, to be\ndedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have\nthus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here dedicated to\nthe great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take\nincreased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full\nmeasure of devotion--that we here highly resolve, that these dead shall\nnot have died in vain--that this nation under God shall have a new birth\nof freedom--and that government of the people, by the people and for the\npeople, shall not perish from the earth."It was during the dark days of the war that he wrote this simple letter\nof sympathy to a bereaved mother:--\n\n"I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement that\nyou are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of\nbattle.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which\nshould attempt to beguile you from your grief for a loss so overwhelming,\nbut I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation which may be\nfound in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.I pray that our\nHeavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave\nyou only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn\npride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the\naltar of Freedom."_November_ 21.--Abbie Clark and her cousin Cora came to call and invited\nme and her soldier cousin to come to dinner to-night, at Mrs.He will be here this afternoon and I will give him the\ninvitation._November_ 22.--We had a delightful visit.Thompson took us up into\nhis den and showed us curios from all over the world and as many\npictures as we would find in an art gallery._Friday_.--Last evening Uncle Edward took a party of us, including Abbie\nClark, to Wallack\'s Theater to see "Rosedale," which is having a great\nrun.I enjoyed it and told James it was the best play I ever "heard."He\nsaid I must not say that I "heard" a play.I told James that I heard of a young girl who went abroad and on her\nreturn some one asked her if she saw King Lear and she said, no, he was\nsick all the time she was there!I just loved the play last night and\nlaughed and cried in turn, it seemed so real.I don\'t know what\nGrandmother will say, but I wrote her about it and said, "When you are\nwith the Romans, you must do as the Romans do."I presume she will say\n"that is not the way you were brought up."_December_ 7.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery has orders to move to\nFort Ethan Allen, near Washington, and I have orders to return to\nCanandaigua.I have enjoyed the five weeks very much and as "the\nsoldier" was on parole most of the time I have seen much of interest in\nthe city.Uncle Edward says that he has lived here forty years but has\nnever visited some of the places that we have seen, so he told me when I\nmentioned climbing to the top of Trinity steeple.Canandaigua, _December_ 8.--Home again.I had military attendance as far\nas Paterson, N. J., and came the rest of the way with strangers.Not\ncaring to talk I liked it just as well.When I said good bye I could not\nhelp wondering whether it was for years, or forever.This cruel war is\nterrible and precious lives are being sacrificed and hearts broken every\nday._Christmas Eve,_ 1863.--Sarah Gibson Howell was married to Major Foster\nthis evening.It was a\nbeautiful wedding and we all enjoyed it.Some time ago I asked her to\nwrite in my album and she sewed a lock of her black curling hair on the\npage and in the center of it wrote, "Forget not Gippie."_December_ 31.--Our brother John was married in Boston to-day to Laura\nArnold, a lovely girl.1864\n\n_April_ 1.--Grandfather had decided to go to New York to attend the fair\ngiven by the Sanitary Commission, and he is taking two immense books,\nwhich are more than one hundred years old, to present to the Commission,\nfor the benefit of the war fund._April_ 18.--Grandfather returned home to-day, unexpectedly to us.I\nknew he was sick when I met him at the door.He had traveled all night\nalone from New York, although he said that a stranger, a fellow\npassenger, from Ann Arbor, Mich., on the train noticed that he was\nsuffering and was very kind to him.He said he fell in his room at\nGramercy Park Hotel in the night, and his knee was very painful.Cheney and he said the hurt was a serious one and needed\nmost careful attention.I was invited to a spelling school at Abbie\nClark\'s in the evening and Grandmother said that she and Anna would take\ncare of Grandfather till I got back, and then I could sit up by him the\nrest of the night.We spelled down and had quite a merry time.Major C.\nS. Aldrich had escaped from prison and was there.He came home with me,\nas my soldier is down in Virginia._April_ 19.--Grandfather is much worse.Lightfoote has come to\nstay with us all the time and we have sent for Aunt Glorianna._April_ 20.--Grandfather dictated a letter to-night to a friend of his\nin New York.After I had finished he asked me if I had mended his\ngloves.I said no, but I would have them ready when he wanted them.he looks so sick I fear he will never wear his gloves\nagain._May_ 16.--I have not written in my diary for a month and it has been\nthe saddest month of my life.He was\nburied May 2, just two weeks from the day that he returned from New\nYork.We did everything for him that could be done, but at the end of\nthe first week the doctors saw that he was beyond all human aid.Uncle\nThomas told the doctors that they must tell him.He was much surprised\nbut received the verdict calmly.He said "he had no notes out and\nperhaps it was the best time to go."He had taught us how to live and he\nseemed determined to show us how a Christian should die.He said he\nwanted "Grandmother and the children to come to him and have all the\nrest remain outside."When we came into the room he said to Grandmother,\n"Do you know what the doctors say?"She bowed her head, and then he\nmotioned for her to come on one side and Anna and me on the other and\nkneel by his bedside.He placed a hand upon us and upon her and said to\nher, "All the rest seem very much excited, but you and I must be\ncomposed."Then he asked us to say the 23d Psalm, "The Lord is my\nShepherd," and then all of us said the Lord\'s Prayer together after\nGrandmother had offered a little prayer for grace and strength in this\ntrying hour.Then he said, "Grandmother, you must take care of the\ngirls, and, girls, you must take care of Grandmother."We felt as though\nour hearts would break and were sure we never could be happy again.During the next few days he often spoke of dying and of what we must do\nwhen he was gone.Once when I was sitting by him he looked up and smiled\nand said, "You will lose all your roses watching over me."A good many\nbusiness men came in to see him to receive his parting blessing.The two\nMcKechnie brothers, Alexander and James, came in together on their way\nhome from church the Sunday before he died.He lived until Saturday, the 30th, and in the morning he said, "Open the\ndoor wide."We did so and he said, "Let the King of Glory enter in."Very soon after he said, "I am going home to Paradise," and then sank\ninto that sleep which on this earth knows no waking.I sat by the window\nnear his bed and watched the rain beat into the grass and saw the\npeonies and crocuses and daffodils beginning to come up out of the\nground and I thought to myself, I shall never see the flowers come up\nagain without thinking of these sad, sad days.He was buried Monday\nafternoon, May 2, from the Congregational church, and Dr.Daggett\npreached a sermon from a favorite text of Grandfather\'s, "I shall die in\nmy nest."James and John came and as we stood with dear Grandmother and\nall the others around his open grave and heard Dr.Daggett say in his\nbeautiful sympathetic voice, "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to\ndust," we felt that we were losing our best friend; but he told us that\nwe must live for Grandmother and so we will.The next Sabbath, Anna and I were called out of church by a messenger,\nwho said that Grandmother was taken suddenly ill and was dying.When we\nreached the house attendants were all about her administering\nrestoratives, but told us she was rapidly sinking.I asked if I might\nspeak to her and was reluctantly permitted, as they thought best not to\ndisturb her.I sat down by her and with tearful voice said,\n"Grandmother, don\'t you know that Grandfather said we were to care for\nyou and you were to care for us and if you die we cannot do as\nGrandfather said?"She opened her eyes and looked at me and said\nquietly, "Dry your eyes, child, I shall not die to-day or to-morrow."Inscribed in my diary:\n\n    "They are passing away, they are passing away,\n    Not only the young, but the aged and gray.Their places are vacant, no longer we see\n    The armchair in waiting, as it used to be.The hat and the coat are removed from the nail,\n    Where for years they have hung, every day without fail.The shoes and the slippers are needed no more,\n    Nor kept ready waiting, as they were of yore,\n    The desk which he stood at in manhood\'s fresh prime,\n    Which now shows the marks of the finger of time,\n    The bright well worn keys, which were childhood\'s delight\n    Unlocking the treasures kept hidden from sight.These now are mementoes of him who has passed,\n    Who stands there no longer, as we saw him last.Other hands turn the keys, as he did, before,\n    Other eyes will his secrets, if any, explore.The step once elastic, but feeble of late,\n    No longer we watch for through doorway or gate,\n    Though often we turn, half expecting to see,\n    The loved one approaching, but ah!We miss him at all times, at morn when we meet,\n    For the social repast, there is one vacant seat.At noon, and at night, at the hour of prayer,\n    Our hearts fill with sadness, one voice is not there.Yet not without hope his departure we mourn,\n    In faith and in trust, all our sorrows are borne,\n    Borne upward to Him who in kindness and love\n    Sends earthly afflictions to draw us above.Thus hoping and trusting, rejoicing, we\'ll go,\n    Both upward and onward through weal and through woe\n    \'Till all of life\'s changes and conflicts are past\n    Beyond the dark river, to meet him at last."In Memoriam\n\nThomas Beals died in Canandaigua, N. Y., on Saturday, April 30th, 1864,\nin the 81st year of his age.Beals was born in Boston, Mass.,\nNovember 13, 1783.He came to this village in October, 1803, only 14 years after the first\nsettlement of the place.He was married in March, 1805, to Abigail\nField, sister of the first pastor of the Congregational church here.Her\nfamily, in several of its branches, have since been distinguished in the\nministry, the legal profession, and in commercial enterprise.Living to a good old age, and well known as one of our most wealthy and\nrespected citizens, Mr.Beals is another added to the many examples of\nsuccessful men who, by energy and industry, have made their own fortune.On coming to this village, he was teacher in the Academy for a time, and\nafterward entered into mercantile business, in which he had his share of\nvicissitude.When the Ontario Savings Bank was established, 1832, he\nbecame the Treasurer, and managed it successfully till the institution\nceased, in 1835, with his withdrawal.In the meantime he conducted,\nalso, a banking business of his own, and this was continued until a week\nprevious to his death, when he formally withdrew, though for the last\nfive years devolving its more active duties upon his son.As a banker, his sagacity and fidelity won for him the confidence and\nrespect of all classes of persons in this community.The business\nportion of our village is very much indebted to his enterprise for the\neligible structures he built that have more than made good the losses\nsustained by fires.More than fifty years ago he was actively concerned\nin the building of the Congregational church, and also superintended the\nerection of the county jail and almshouse; for many years a trustee of\nCanandaigua Academy, and trustee and treasurer of the Congregational\nchurch.At the time of his death he and his wife, who survives him, were\nthe oldest members of the church, having united with it in 1807, only\neight years after its organization.Until hindered by the infirmities of\nage, he was a constant attendant of its services and ever devoutly\nmaintained the worship of God in his family.No person has been more\ngenerally known among all classes of our citizens.Whether at home or\nabroad he could not fail to be remarked for his gravity and dignity.His\ncharacter was original, independent, and his manners remarkable for a\ndignified courtesy.Our citizens were familiar with his brief, emphatic\nanswers with the wave of his hand.He was fond of books, a great reader,\ncollected a valuable number of volumes, and was happy in the use of\nlanguage both in writing and conversation.In many unusual ways he often\nshowed his kind consideration for the poor and afflicted, and many\npersons hearing of his death gratefully recollect instances, not known\nto others, of his seasonable kindness to them in trouble.In his\ncharities he often studied concealment as carefully as others court\ndisplay.His marked individuality of character and deportment, together\nwith his shrewd discernment and active habits, could not fail to leave a\ndistinct impression on the minds of all.For more than sixty years he transacted business in one place here, and\nhis long life thus teaches more than one generation the value of\nsobriety, diligence, fidelity and usefulness.In his last illness he remarked to a friend that he always loved\nCanandaigua; had done several things for its prosperity, and had\nintended to do more.He had known his measure of affliction; only four\nof eleven children survive him, but children and children\'s children\nministered to the comfort of his last days.Notwithstanding his years\nand infirmities, he was able to visit New York, returning April 18th\nquite unwell, but not immediately expecting a fatal termination.As the\nfinal event drew near, he seemed happily prepared to meet it.He\nconversed freely with his friends and neighbors in a softened and\nbenignant spirit, at once receiving and imparting benedictions.His end\nseemed to realize his favorite citation from Job: "I shall die in my\nnest."His funeral was attended on Monday in the Congregational church by a\nlarge assembly, Dr.Daggett, the pastor, officiating on the\noccasion.--Written by Dr.O. E. Daggett in 1864._May._--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is having hard times in the\nVirginia mud and rain.It is such a change from\ntheir snug winter quarters at Fort Ethan Allen.There are 2,800 men in\nthe Regiment and 1,200 are sick.Charles S. Hoyt of the 126th, which\nis camping close by, has come to the help of these new recruits so\nkindly as to win every heart, quite in contrast to the heartlessness of\ntheir own surgeons._June_ 22.--Captain Morris Brown, of Penn Yan, was killed to-day by a\nmusket shot in the head, while commanding the regiment before\nPetersburg._June_ 23, 1864.--Anna graduated last Thursday, June 16, and was\nvaledictorian of her class.There were eleven girls in the class, Ritie\nTyler, Mary Antes, Jennie Robinson, Hattie Paddock, Lillie Masters,\nAbbie Hills, Miss McNair, Miss Pardee and Miss Palmer, Miss Jasper and\nAnna.The subject of her essay was "The Last Time."I will copy an\naccount of the exercises as they appeared in this week\'s village paper.A WORD FROM AN OLD MAN\n\n"Mr.Editor:\n\n"Less than a century ago I was traveling through this enchanted region\nand accidentally heard that it was commencement week at the seminary.My venerable appearance seemed to command respect and I received\nmany attentions.I presented my snowy head and patriarchal beard at the\ndoors of the sacred institution and was admitted.I heard all the\nclasses, primary, secondary, tertiary, et cetera.I\nrose early, dressed with much care.I affectionately pressed the hands\nof my two landlords and left.When I arrived at the seminary I saw at a\nglance that it was a place where true merit was appreciated.I was\ninvited to a seat among the dignitaries, but declined.I am a modest\nman, I always was.I recognized the benign Principals of the school.You\ncan find no better principles in the states than in Ontario Female\nSeminary.After the report of the committee a very lovely young lady\narose and saluted us in Latin.As she proceeded, I thought the grand\nold Roman tongue had never sounded so musically and when she pronounced\nthe decree, \'Richmond delenda est,\' we all hoped it might be prophetic.Then followed the essays of the other young ladies and then every one\nwaited anxiously for \'The Last Time.\'The story was\nbeautifully told, the adieux were tenderly spoken.We saw the withered\nflowers of early years scattered along the academic ways, and the golden\nfruit of scholarly culture ripening in the gardens of the future.Enchanted by the sorrowful eloquence, bewildered by the melancholy\nbrilliancy, I sent a rosebud to the charming valedictorian and wandered\nout into the grounds.I went to the concert in the evening and was\npleased and delighted.I shall return next year unless\nthe gout carries me off.I hope I shall hear just such beautiful music,\nsee just such beautiful faces and dine at the same excellent hotel.Anna closed her valedictory with these words:\n\n"May we meet at one gate when all\'s over;\n  The ways they are many and wide,\nAnd seldom are two ways the same;\n  Side by side may we stand\nAt the same little door when all\'s done.The ways they are many,\n    The end it is one."_July_ 10.--We have had word of the death of Spencer F. Lincoln._August._--The New York State S. S. Convention was held in Buffalo and\namong others Fanny Gaylord, Mary Field and myself attended.We had a\nfine time and were entertained at the home of Mr.Her\nmother is living with her, a dear old lady who was Judge Atwater\'s\ndaughter and used to go to school to Grandfather Beals.We went with\nother delegates on an excursion to Niagara Falls and went into the\nexpress office at the R. R. station to see Grant Schley, who is express\nagent there.He said it seemed good to see so many home faces._September_ 1.--My war letters come from Georgetown Hospital now.Noah T. Clarke is very anxious and sends telegrams to Andrew Chesebro\nevery day to go and see his brother._September_ 30.--To-day the "Benjamin" of the family reached home under\nthe care of Dr.J. Byron Hayes, who was sent to Washington after him.Noah T. Clarke\'s to see him and found him just a shadow\nof his former self.However, "hope springs eternal in the human breast"\nand he says he knows he will soon be well again.This is his thirtieth\nbirthday and it is glorious that he can spend it at home.Noah T. Clarke accompanied his brother to-day to the\nold home in Naples and found two other soldier brothers, William and\nJoseph, had just arrived on leave of absence from the army so the\nmother\'s heart sang "Praise God from whom all blessings flow."The\nfourth brother has also returned to his home in Illinois, disabled._November._--They are holding Union Revival Services in town now.One\nevangelist from out of town said he would call personally at the homes\nand ask if all were Christians.Anna told Grandmother if he came here\nshe should tell him about her.Grandmother said we must each give an\naccount for ourselves.Anna said she should tell him about her little\nGrandmother anyway.We saw him coming up the walk about 11 a.m.and Anna\nwent to the door and asked him in.They sat down in the parlor and he\nremarked about the pleasant weather and Canandaigua such a beautiful\ntown and the people so cultured.She said yes, she found the town every\nway desirable and the people pleasant, though she had heard it remarked\nthat strangers found it hard to get acquainted and that you had to have\na residence above the R. R. track and give a satisfactory answer as to\nwho your Grandfather was, before admittance was granted to the best\nsociety.He asked\nher how long she had lived here and she told him nearly all of her brief\nexistence!She said if he had asked her how old she was she would have\ntold him she was so young that Will Adams last May was appointed her\nguardian.He asked how many there were in the family and she said her\nGrandmother, her sister and herself.He said, "They are Christians, I\nsuppose.""Yes," she said, "my sister is a S. S. teacher and my\nGrandmother was born a Christian, about 80 years ago."Anna said she would have to be excused\nas she seldom saw company.When he arose to go he said, "My dear young\nlady, I trust that you are a Christian.""Mercy yes," she said, "years\nago."He said he was very glad and hoped she would let her light shine.She said that was what she was always doing--that the other night at a\nrevival meeting she sang every verse of every hymn and came home feeling\nas though she had herself personally rescued by hand at least fifty\n"from sin and the grave."He smiled approvingly and bade her good bye.She told Grandmother she presumed he would say "he had not found so\ngreat faith, no not in Israel."George Wilson leads and\ninstructs us on the Sunday School lesson for the following Sunday.Wilson knows\nBarnes\' notes, Cruden\'s Concordance, the Westminster Catechism and the\nBible from beginning to end.1865\n\n_March_ 5.--I have just read President Lincoln\'s second inaugural\naddress.It only takes five minutes to read it but, oh, how much it\ncontains._March_ 20.--Hardly a day passes that we do not hear news of Union\nvictories.Every one predicts that the war is nearly at an end._March_ 29.--An officer arrived here from the front yesterday and he\nsaid that, on Saturday morning, shortly after the battle commenced which\nresulted so gloriously for the Union in front of Petersburg, President\nLincoln, accompanied by General Grant and staff, started for the\nbattlefield, and reached there in time to witness the close of the\ncontest and the bringing in of the prisoners.His presence was\nimmediately recognized and created the most intense enthusiasm.He\nafterwards rode over the battlefield, listened to the report of General\nParke to General Grant, and added his thanks for the great service\nrendered in checking the onslaught of the rebels and in capturing so\nmany of their number.I read this morning the order of Secretary Stanton\nfor the flag raising on Fort Sumter.It reads thus: "War department,\nAdjutant General\'s office, Washington, March 27th, 1865, General Orders\nNo.Ordered, first: That at the hour of noon, on the 14th day of\nApril, 1865, Brevet Major General Anderson will raise and plant upon the\nruins of Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, the same U. S. Flag which\nfloated over the battlements of this fort during the rebel assault, and\nwhich was lowered and saluted by him and the small force of his command\nwhen the works were evacuated on the 14th day of April, 1861.Second,\nThat the flag, when raised be saluted by 100 guns from Fort Sumter and\nby a national salute from every fort and rebel battery that fired upon\nFort Sumter.Third, That suitable ceremonies be had upon the occasion,\nunder the direction of Major-General William T. Sherman, whose military\noperations compelled the rebels to evacuate Charleston, or, in his\nabsence, under the charge of Major-General Q. A. Gillmore, commanding\nthe department.Among the ceremonies will be the delivery of a public\naddress by the Rev.Fourth, That the naval forces at\nCharleston and their Commander on that station be invited to participate\nin the ceremonies of the occasion.By order of the President of the\nUnited States.E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War."_April,_ 1865.--What a month this has been.On the 6th of April Governor\nFenton issued this proclamation: "Richmond has fallen.The wicked men\nwho governed the so-called Confederate States have fled their capital,\nshorn of their power and influence.The rebel armies have been defeated,\nbroken and scattered.Victory everywhere attends our banners and our\narmies, and we are rapidly moving to the closing scenes of the war.Through the self-sacrifice and heroic devotion of our soldiers, the life\nof the republic has been saved and the American Union preserved.I,\nReuben E. Fenton, Governor of the State of New York, do designate\nFriday, the 14th of April, the day appointed for the ceremony of raising\nthe United States flag on Fort Sumter, as a day of Thanksgiving, prayer\nand praise to Almighty God, for the signal blessings we have received at\nHis hands."_Saturday, April_ 8.--The cannon has fired a salute of thirty-six guns\nto celebrate the fall of Richmond.This evening the streets were\nthronged with men, women and children all acting crazy as if they had\nnot the remotest idea where they were or what they were doing.Atwater\nblock was beautifully lighted and the band was playing in front of it.On the square they fired guns, and bonfires were lighted in the streets.Clark\'s house was lighted from the very garret and they had a\ntransparency in front, with "Richmond" on it, which Fred Thompson made.We didn\'t even light "our other candle," for Grandmother said she\npreferred to keep Saturday night and pity and pray for the poor\nsuffering, wounded soldiers, who are so apt to be forgotten in the hour\nof victory._Sunday Evening, April_ 9.--There were great crowds at church this\nmorning.Daggett\'s text was from Prov.18: 10: "The name of the Lord\nis a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe."They sang hymns relating to our country and Dr.Daggett\'s prayers were full of thanksgiving.Noah T. Clarke had the\nchapel decorated with flags and opened the Sunday School by singing,\n"Marching On," "My Country, \'tis of Thee," "The Star Spangled Banner,"\n"Glory, Hallelujah," etc.H. Lamport talked very pleasantly and\npaid a very touching tribute to the memory of the boys, who had gone out\nto defend their country, who would never come "marching home again."He\nlost his only son, 18 years old (in the 126th), about two years ago.I\nsat near Mary and Emma Wheeler and felt so sorry for them._Monday Morning, April_ 10.--"Whether I am in the body, or out of the\nbody, I know not, but one thing I know," Lee has surrendered!and all\nthe people seem crazy in consequence.The bells are ringing, boys and\ngirls, men and women are running through the streets wild with\nexcitement; the flags are all flying, one from the top of our church,\nand such a "hurrah boys" generally, I never dreamed of.We were quietly\neating our breakfast this morning about 7 o\'clock, when our church bell\ncommenced to ring, then the Methodist bell, and now all the bells in\ntown are ringing.Noah T. Clarke ran by, all excitement, and I don\'t\nbelieve he knows where he is.Aldrich\npassing, so I rushed to the window and he waved his hat.I raised the\nwindow and asked him what was the matter?He came to the front door\nwhere I met him and he almost shook my hand off and said, "The war is\nover.We have Lee\'s surrender, with his own name signed."I am going\ndown town now, to see for myself, what is going on.Later--I have\nreturned and I never saw such performances in my life.Every man has a\nbell or a horn, and every girl a flag and a little bell, and every one\nis tied with red, white and blue ribbons.I am going down town again\nnow, with my flag in one hand and bell in the other and make all the\nnoise I can.Noah T. Clarke and other leading citizens are riding\naround on a dray cart with great bells in their hands ringing them as\nhard as they can.The latest musical\ninstrument invented is called the "Jerusalem fiddle."Some boys put a\ndry goods box upon a cart, put some rosin on the edge of the box and\npulled a piece of timber back and forth across it, making most unearthly\nsounds.They drove through all the streets, Ed Lampman riding on the\nhorse and driving it._Monday evening, April_ 10.--I have been out walking for the last hour\nand a half, looking at the brilliant illuminations, transparencies and\neverything else and I don\'t believe I was ever so tired in my life.The\nbells have not stopped ringing more than five minutes all day and every\none is glad to see Canandaigua startled out of its propriety for once.Every yard of red, white and blue ribbon in the stores has been sold,\nalso every candle and every flag.One society worked hard all the\nafternoon making transparencies and then there were no candles to put in\nto light them, but they will be ready for the next celebration when\npeace is proclaimed.The Court House, Atwater Block, and hotel have\nabout two dozen candles in each window throughout, besides flags and\nmottoes of every description.It is certainly the best impromptu display\never gotten up in this town."Victory is Grant-ed," is in large red,\nwhite and blue letters in front of Atwater Block.The speeches on the\nsquare this morning were all very good.Daggett commenced with\nprayer, and such a prayer, I wish all could have heard it.Francis\nGranger, E. G. Lapham, Judge Smith, Alexander Howell, Noah T. Clarke and\nothers made speeches and we sang "Old Hundred" in conclusion, and Rev.Hibbard dismissed us with the benediction.Noah T. Clarke, but he told me to be careful and not hurt him, for he\nblistered his hands to-day ringing that bell.He says he is going to\nkeep the bell for his grandchildren.Between the speeches on the square\nthis morning a song was called for and Gus Coleman mounted the steps and\nstarted "John Brown" and all the assembly joined in the chorus, "Glory,\nHallelujah."This has been a never to be forgotten day._April_ 15.--The news came this morning that our dear president, Abraham\nLincoln, was assassinated yesterday, on the day appointed for\nthanksgiving for Union victories.I have felt sick over it all day and\nso has every one that I have seen.All seem to feel as though they had\nlost a personal friend, and tears flow plenteously.How soon has sorrow\nfollowed upon the heels of joy!One week ago to-night we were\ncelebrating our victories with loud acclamations of mirth and good\ncheer.Now every one is silent and sad and the earth and heavens seem\nclothed in sack-cloth.The\nflags are all at half mast, draped with mourning, and on every store and\ndwelling-house some sign of the nation\'s loss is visible.Just after\nbreakfast this morning, I looked out of the window and saw a group of\nmen listening to the reading of a morning paper, and I feared from their\nsilent, motionless interest that something dreadful had happened, but I\nwas not prepared to hear of the cowardly murder of our President.And\nWilliam H. Seward, too, I suppose cannot survive his wounds.I went down town shortly after I heard the news, and it\nwas wonderful to see the effect of the intelligence upon everybody,\nsmall or great, rich or poor.Every one was talking low, with sad and\nanxious looks.But we know that God still reigns and will do what is\nbest for us all.Perhaps we\'re "putting our trust too much in princes,"\nforgetting the Great Ruler, who alone can create or destroy, and\ntherefore He has taken from us the arm of flesh that we may lean more\nconfidingly and entirely upon Him.I trust that the men who committed\nthese foul deeds will soon be brought to justice._Sunday, Easter Day, April_ 16.--I went to church this morning.The\npulpit and choir-loft were covered with flags festooned with crape.Although a very disagreeable day, the house was well filled.The first\nhymn sung was "Oh God our help in ages past, our hope for years to\ncome."Daggett\'s prayer, I can never forget, he alluded so\nbeautifully to the nation\'s loss, and prayed so fervently that the God\nof our fathers might still be our God, through every calamity or\naffliction, however severe or mysterious.All seemed as deeply affected\nas though each one had been suddenly bereft of his best friend.The hymn\nsung after the prayer, commenced with "Yes, the Redeemer rose."Daggett said that he had intended to preach a sermon upon the\nresurrection.He read the psalm beginning, "Lord, Thou hast been our\ndwelling-place in all generations."His text was "That our faith and\nhope might be in God."He commenced by saying, "I feel as you feel this\nmorning: our sad hearts have all throbbed in unison since yesterday\nmorning when the telegram announced to us Abraham Lincoln is shot."He\nsaid the last week would never be forgotten, for never had any of us\nseen one come in with so much joy, that went out with so much sorrow.His whole sermon related to the President\'s life and death, and, in\nconclusion, he exhorted us not to be despondent, for he was confident\nthat the ship of state would not go down, though the helmsman had\nsuddenly been taken away while the promised land was almost in view.He\nprayed for our new President, that he might be filled with grace and\npower from on High, to perform his high and holy trust.On Thursday we\nare to have a union meeting in our church, but it will not be the day of\ngeneral rejoicing and thanksgiving we expected.In Sunday school the desk was draped with mourning, and\nthe flag at half-mast was also festooned with crape.Noah T. Clarke\nopened the exercises with the hymn "He leadeth me," followed by "Though\nthe days are dark with sorrow," "We know not what\'s before us," "My days\nare gliding swiftly by."Clarke said that we always meant to\nsing "America," after every victory, and last Monday he was wondering if\nwe would not have to sing it twice to-day, or add another verse, but our\nfeelings have changed since then.Nevertheless he thought we had better\nsing "America," for we certainly ought to love our country more than\never, now that another, and such another, martyr, had given up his life\nfor it.Then he talked to the children and said that last\nFriday was supposed to be the anniversary of the day upon which our Lord\nwas crucified, and though, at the time the dreadful deed was committed,\nevery one felt the day to be the darkest one the earth ever knew; yet\nsince then, the day has been called "Good Friday," for it was the death\nof Christ which gave life everlasting to all the people.So he thought\nthat life would soon come out of darkness, which now overshadows us all,\nand that the death of Abraham Lincoln might yet prove the nation\'s life\nin God\'s own most mysterious way._Wednesday evening, April_ 19, 1865.--This being the day set for the\nfuneral of Abraham Lincoln at Washington, it was decided to hold the\nservice to-day, instead of Thursday, as previously announced in the\nCongregational church.All places of business were closed and the bells\nof the village churches tolled from half past ten till eleven o\'clock.It is the fourth anniversary of the first bloodshed of the war at\nBaltimore.It was said to-day, that while the services were being held\nin the White House and Lincoln\'s body lay in state under the dome of the\ncapitol, that more than twenty-five millions of people all over the\ncivilized world were gathered in their churches weeping over the death\nof the martyred President.We met at our church at half after ten\no\'clock this morning.The bells tolled until eleven o\'clock, when the\nservices commenced.The church was beautifully decorated with flags and\nblack and white cloth, wreaths, mottoes and flowers, the galleries and\nall.There was a shield beneath the arch of\nthe pulpit with this text upon it: "The memory of the just is blessed."Under the choir-loft the picture of Abraham Lincoln\nhung amid the flags and drapery.The motto, beneath the gallery, was\nthis text: "Know ye that the Lord He is God."The four pastors of the\nplace walked in together and took seats upon the platform, which was\nconstructed for the occasion.The choir chanted "Lord, Thou hast been\nour dwelling-place in all generations," and then the Episcopal rector,\nRev.Leffingwell, read from the psalter, and Rev.Daggett\nfollowed with prayer.Judge Taylor was then called upon for a short\naddress, and he spoke well, as he always does.The choir sang "God is\nour refuge and our strength."_Thursday, April_ 20.--The papers are full of the account of the funeral\nobsequies of President Lincoln.We take Harper\'s Weekly and every event\nis pictured so vividly it seems as though we were eye witnesses of it\nall.The picture of "Lincoln at home" is beautiful.What a dear, kind\nman he was.It is a comfort to know that the assassination was not the\noutcome of an organized plot of Southern leaders, but rather a\nconspiracy of a few fanatics, who undertook in this way to avenge the\ndefeat of their cause.It is rumored that one of the conspirators has\nbeen located._April_ 24.--Fannie Gaylord and Kate Lapham have returned from their\neastern trip and told us of attending the President\'s funeral in Albany,\nand I had a letter from Bessie Seymour, who is in New York, saying that\nshe walked in the procession until half past two in the morning, in\norder to see his face.They say that they never saw him in life, but in\ndeath he looked just as all the pictures represent him.We all wear\nLincoln badges now, with pin attached.They are pictures of Lincoln upon\na tiny flag, bordered with crape.Susie Daggett has just made herself a\nflag, six feet by four.Noah T. Clarke gave\none to her husband upon his birthday, April 8.I think everybody ought\nto own a flag._April_ 26.--Now we have the news that J. Wilkes Booth, who shot the\nPresident and who has been concealing himself in Virginia, has been\ncaught, and refusing to surrender was shot dead.It has taken just\ntwelve days to bring him to retribution.I am glad that he is dead if he\ncould not be taken alive, but it seems as though shooting was too good\nfor him.However, we may as well take this as really God\'s way, as the\ndeath of the President, for if he had been taken alive, the country\nwould have been so furious to get at him and tear him to pieces the\nturmoil would have been great and desperate.It may be the best way to\ndispose of him.Of course, it is best, or it would not be so.Morse\ncalled this evening and he thinks Booth was shot by a lot of cowards.The flags have been flying all day, since the news came, but all,\nexcepting Albert Granger, seem sorry that he was not disabled instead of\nbeing shot dead.Albert seems able to look into the "beyond" and also to\nlocate departed spirits.His "latest" is that he is so glad that Booth\ngot to h--l before Abraham Lincoln got to Springfield.Fred Thompson went down to New York last Saturday and while stopping\na few minutes at St.Johnsville, he heard a man crowing over the death\nof the President.Thompson marched up to him, collared him and\nlanded him nicely in the gutter.The bystanders were delighted and\ncarried the champion to a platform and called for a speech, which was\ngiven.Every one who hears the story, says:\n"Three cheers for F. F.The other afternoon at our society Kate Lapham wanted to divert our\nminds from gossip I think, and so started a discussion upon the\nrespective characters of Washington and Napoleon.It was just after\nsupper and Laura Chapin was about resuming her sewing and she exclaimed,\n"Speaking of Washington, makes me think that I ought to wash my hands,"\nso she left the room for that purpose._May_ 7.--Anna and I wore our new poke bonnets to church this morning\nand thought we looked quite "scrumptious," but Grandmother said after we\ngot home, if she had realized how unbecoming they were to us and to the\nhouse of the Lord, she could not have countenanced them enough to have\nsat in the same pew.Daggett in his\ntext, "It is good for us to be here."It was the first time in a month\nthat he had not preached about the affairs of the Nation.In the afternoon the Sacrament was administered and Rev.A. D. Eddy, D.\nD., who was pastor from 1823 to 1835, was present and officiated.Deacon\nCastle and Deacon Hayes passed the communion.Eddy concluded the\nservices with some personal memories.He said that forty-two years ago\nlast November, he presided upon a similar occasion for the first time in\nhis life and it was in this very church.He is now the only surviving\nmale member who was present that day, but there are six women living,\nand Grandmother is one of the six.The Monthly Concert of Prayer for Missions was held in the chapel in the\nevening.Daggett told us that the collection taken for missions\nduring the past year amounted to $500.He commended us and said it was\nthe largest sum raised in one year for this purpose in the twenty years\nof his pastorate.Eddy then said that in contrast he would tell us\nthat the collection for missions the first year he was here, amounted to\n$5, and that he was advised to touch very lightly upon the subject in\nhis appeals as it was not a popular theme with the majority of the\npeople.One member, he said, annexed three ciphers to his name when\nasked to subscribe to a missionary document which was circulated, and\nanother man replied thus to an appeal for aid in evangelizing a portion\nof Asia: "If you want to send a missionary to Jerusalem, Yates county, I\nwill contribute, but not a cent to go to the other side of the world."C. H. A. Buckley was present also and gave an interesting talk.By\nway of illustration, he said he knew a small boy who had been earning\ntwenty-five cents a week for the heathen by giving up eating butter.The\nother day he seemed to think that his generosity, as well as his\nself-denial, had reached the utmost limit and exclaimed as he sat at the\ntable, "I think the heathen have had gospel enough, please pass the\nbutter."_May_ 10.--Jeff Davis was captured to-day at Irwinsville, Ga., when he\nwas attempting to escape in woman\'s apparel.Green drew a picture of\nhim, and Mr.We bought one as a\nsouvenir of the war.The big headlines in the papers this morning say, "The hunt is up.He\nbrandisheth a bowie-knife but yieldeth to six solid arguments.At\nIrwinsville, Ga., about daylight on the 10th instant, Col.Prichard,\ncommanding the 4th Michigan Cavalry, captured Jeff Davis, family and\nstaff.They will be forwarded under strong guard without delay."The\nflags have been flying all day, and every one is about as pleased over\nthe manner of his capture as over the fact itself.Lieutenant Hathaway,\none of the staff, is a friend of Mr.Manning Wells, and he was pretty\nsure he would follow Davis, so we were not surprised to see his name\namong the captured.Wells says he is as fine a horseman as he ever\nsaw._Monday evg., May_ 22.--I went to Teachers\' meeting at Mrs.George Willson is the leader and she told\nus at the last meeting to be prepared this evening to give our opinion\nin regard to the repentance of Solomon before he died.We concluded that\nhe did repent although the Bible does not absolutely say so.Grandmother\nthinks such questions are unprofitable, as we would better be repenting\nof our sins, instead of hunting up Solomon\'s at this late day._May_ 23.--We arise about 5:30 nowadays and Anna does not like it very\nwell.I asked her why she was not as good natured as usual to-day and\nshe said it was because she got up "s\'urly."She thinks Solomon must\nhave been acquainted with Grandmother when he wrote "She ariseth while\nit is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her\nmaidens."Patrick Burns, the "poet," who has also been our man of all\nwork the past year, has left us to go into Mr.He\nseemed to feel great regret when he bade us farewell and told us he\nnever lived in a better regulated home than ours and he hoped his\nsuccessor would take the same interest in us that he had.He left one of his poems as a souvenir.It is entitled, "There will soon be an end to the war," written in\nMarch, hence a prophecy.Morse had read it and pronounced it\n"tip top."It was mostly written in capitals and I asked him if he\nfollowed any rule in regard to their use.He said "Oh, yes, always begin\na line with one and then use your own discretion with the rest."_May_ 25.--I wish that I could have been in Washington this week, to\nhave witnessed the grand review of Meade\'s and Sherman\'s armies.The\nnewspaper accounts are most thrilling.The review commenced on Tuesday\nmorning and lasted two days.It took over six hours for Meade\'s army to\npass the grand stand, which was erected in front of the President\'s\nhouse.It was witnessed by the President, Generals Grant, Meade, and\nSherman, Secretary Stanton, and many others in high authority.At ten\no\'clock, Wednesday morning, Sherman\'s army commenced to pass in review.His men did not show the signs of hardship and suffering which marked\nthe appearance of the Army of the Potomac.Flags were flying everywhere and windows,\ndoorsteps and sidewalks were crowded with people, eager to get a view of\nthe grand armies.The city was as full of strangers, who had come to see\nthe sight, as on Inauguration Day.Very soon, all that are left of the\ncompanies, who went from here, will be marching home, "with glad and\ngallant tread."_June_ 3.--I was invited up to Sonnenberg yesterday and Lottie and Abbie\nClark called for me at 5:30 p.m., with their pony and democrat wagon.Jennie Rankine was the only other lady present and, for a wonder, the\nparty consisted of six gentlemen and five ladies, which has not often\nbeen the case during the war.After supper we adjourned to the lawn and\nplayed croquet, a new game which Mr.It is something like billiards, only a mallet is used instead of a\ncue to hit the balls.I did not like it very well, because I couldn\'t\nhit the balls through the wickets as I wanted to."We" sang all the\nsongs, patriotic and sentimental, that we could think of.Lyon came to call upon me to-day, before he returned to New York.I told him that I regretted that I could\nnot sing yesterday, when all the others did, and that the reason that I\nmade no attempts in that line was due to the fact that one day in\nchurch, when I thought I was singing a very good alto, my grandfather\nwhispered to me, and said: "Daughter, you are off the key," and ever\nsince then, I had sung with the spirit and with the understanding, but\nnot with my voice.He said perhaps I could get some one to do my singing\nfor me, some day.I told him he was very kind to give me so much\nencouragement.Anna went to a Y.M.C.A.meeting last evening at our\nchapel and said, when the hymn "Rescue the perishing," was given out,\nshe just "raised her Ebenezer" and sang every verse as hard as she\ncould.The meeting was called in behalf of a young man who has been\naround town for the past few days, with only one arm, who wants to be a\nminister and sells sewing silk and needles and writes poetry during\nvacation to help himself along.I have had a cough lately and\nGrandmother decided yesterday to send for the doctor.He placed me in a\nchair and thumped my lungs and back and listened to my breathing while\nGrandmother sat near and watched him in silence, but finally she said,\n"Caroline isn\'t used to being pounded!"The doctor smiled and said he\nwould be very careful, but the treatment was not so severe as it seemed.After he was gone, we asked Grandmother if she liked him and she said\nyes, but if she had known of his "new-fangled" notions and that he wore\na full beard she might not have sent for him!Carr was\nclean-shaven and also Grandfather and Dr.Daggett, and all of the\nGrangers, she thinks that is the only proper way.What a funny little\nlady she is!_June_ 8.--There have been unusual attractions down town for the past\ntwo days.a man belonging to the\nRavel troupe walked a rope, stretched across Main street from the third\nstory of the Webster House to the chimney of the building opposite.He\nis said to be Blondin\'s only rival and certainly performed some\nextraordinary feats.Then\ntook a wheel-barrow across and returned with it backwards.He went\nacross blindfolded with a bag over his head.Then he attached a short\ntrapeze to the rope and performed all sorts of gymnastics.There were at\nleast 1,000 people in the street and in the windows gazing at him.Grandmother says that she thinks all such performances are wicked,\ntempting Providence to win the applause of men.Nothing would induce her\nto look upon such things.She is a born reformer and would abolish all\nsuch schemes.This morning she wanted us to read the 11th chapter of\nHebrews to her, about faith, and when we had finished the forty verses,\nAnna asked her what was the difference between her and Moses.Grandmother said there were many points of difference.Anna was not\nfound in the bulrushes and she was not adopted by a king\'s daughter.Anna said she was thinking how the verse read, "Moses was a proper\nchild," and she could not remember having ever done anything strictly\n"proper" in her life.I noticed that Grandmother did not contradict her,\nbut only smiled._June_ 13.--Van Amburgh\'s circus was in town to-day and crowds attended\nand many of our most highly respected citizens, but Grandmother had\nother things for us to consider._June_ 16.--The census man for this town is Mr.He called\nhere to-day and was very inquisitive, but I think I answered all of his\nquestions although I could not tell him the exact amount of my property.Grandmother made us laugh to-day when we showed her a picture of the\nSiamese twins, and I said, "Grandmother, if I had been their mother I\nshould have cut them apart when they were babies, wouldn\'t you?"The\ndear little lady looked up so bright and said, "If I had been Mrs.Siam,\nI presume I should have done just as she did."I don\'t believe that we\nwill be as amusing as she is when we are 82 years old._Saturday, July_ 8.--What excitement there must have been in Washington\nyesterday over the execution of the conspirators.Surratt should have deserved hanging with the others.I saw a\npicture of them all upon a scaffold and her face was screened by an\numbrella.I read in one paper that the doctor who dressed Booth\'s broken\nleg was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas.Jefferson Davis, I suppose, is\nglad to have nothing worse served upon him, thus far, than confinement\nin Fortress Monroe.It is wonderful that 800,000 men are returning so\nquietly from the army to civil life that it is scarcely known, save by\nthe welcome which they receive in their own homes.Buddington, of Brooklyn, preached to-day.His wife\nwas Miss Elizabeth Willson, Clara Coleman\'s sister.My Sunday School\nbook is "Mill on the Floss," but Grandmother says it is not Sabbath\nreading, so I am stranded for the present._December_ 8.--Yesterday was Thanksgiving day.I do not remember that it\nwas ever observed in December before.President Johnson appointed it as\na day of national thanksgiving for our many blessings as a people, and\nGovernor Fenton and several governors of other states have issued\nproclamations in accordance with the President\'s recommendation.The\nweather was very unpleasant, but we attended the union thanksgiving\nservice held in our church.The choir sang America for the opening\npiece.Daggett read Miriam\'s song of praise: "The Lord hath\ntriumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea."Then he offered one of his most eloquent and fervent prayers, in\nwhich the returned soldiers, many of whom are in broken health or maimed\nfor life, in consequence of their devotion and loyalty to their country,\nwere tenderly remembered.His text was from the 126th Psalm, "The Lord\nhath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."It was one of his\nbest sermons.He mentioned three things in particular which the Lord has\ndone for us, whereof we are glad: First, that the war has closed;\nsecond, that the Union is preserved; third, for the abolition of\nslavery.After the sermon, a collection was taken for the poor, and Dr.A. D. Eddy, who was present, offered prayer.The choir sang an anthem\nwhich they had especially prepared for the occasion, and then all joined\nin the doxology.Uncle Thomas Beals\' family of four united with our\nthree at Thanksgiving dinner.Uncle sent to New York for the oysters,\nand a famous big turkey, with all the usual accompaniments, made us a\nfine repast.Anna and Ritie Tyler are reading together Irving\'s Life of\nWashington, two afternoons each week.I wonder how long they will keep\nit up._December_ 11.--I have been down town buying material for garments for\nour Home Missionary family which we are to make in our society.Anna and\nI were cutting them out and basting them ready for sewing, and\ngrandmother told us to save all the basting threads when we were through\nwith them and tie them and wind them on a spool for use another time.Anna, who says she never wants to begin anything that she cannot finish\nin 15 minutes, felt rather tired at the prospect of this unexpected task\nand asked Grandmother how she happened to contract such economical\nideas.Grandmother told her that if she and Grandfather had been\nwasteful in their younger days, we would not have any silk dresses to\nwear now.Anna said if that was the case she was glad that Grandmother\nsaved the basting thread!1866\n\n_February_ 13.--Our brother James was married to-day to Louise\nLivingston James of New York City._February_ 20.--Our society is going to hold a fair for the Freedmen, in\nthe Town Hall.Susie Daggett and I have been there all day to see about\nthe tables and stoves._February_ 21.--Been at the hall all day, trimming the room.Backus came down and if they had not helped us we would\nnot have done much.Backus put up all the principal drapery and made\nit look beautiful._February_ 22.--At the hall all day.We had\nquite a crowd in the evening and took in over three hundred dollars.Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there all night to take care\nof the hall.We had a fish pond, a grab-bag and a post-office.Anna says\nthey had all the smart people in the post-office to write the\nletters,--Mr.Morse, Miss Achert, Albert Granger and herself.Some one\nasked Albert Granger if his law business was good and he said one man\nthronged into his office one day._February_ 23.--We took in two hundred dollars to-day at the fair.George Willson if she could not\nwrite a poem expressing our thanks to Mr.Backus and she stepped aside\nfor about five minutes and handed us the following lines which we sent\nto him.We think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair."In ancient time the God of Wine\n    They crowned with vintage of the vine,\n    And sung his praise with song and glee\n    And all their best of minstrelsy.The Backus whom we honor now\n    Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow\n    With heathen emblems--better he\n    Will love our gratitude to see\n    Expressed in all the happy faces\n    Assembled in these pleasant places.May joy attend his footsteps here\n    And crown him in a brighter sphere."_February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to\nclean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of\neverything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this\nafternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the\nexpenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of\nthanks:\n\n_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the\nTown Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,\nand the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks\nto the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous\ncontributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public\nenterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young\nladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such\ngenerous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need\nnever again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as\nCanandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But\nour village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New\nYork City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and\nunstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of\nthe hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor\nwould have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are\nespecially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their\nsuperior knowledge and older experience.W. P. Fiske for his\nvaluable services as cashier, and to Messrs.Daggett, Chapin and Hills\nfor services at the door; and to all the little boys and girls who\nhelped in so many ways.The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks to our cashier, the\nmoney is all good, and will soon be on its way carrying substantial\nvisions of something to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor\nFreedmen of the South.By order of Society,\n                                            Carrie C. Richards, Pres\'t.Emma H. Wheeler, Sec\'y.Editor--I expected to see an account of the Young Ladies\' Fair in\nyour last number, but only saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the\nladies to the citizens.Your "local" must have been absent; and I beg\nthe privilege in behalf of myself and many others of doing tardy justice\nto the successful efforts of the Aid Society at their debut February\n22nd.Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and the Society did the\nrest.The decorations were in excellent taste, and so were the young\nladies.The skating pond was never in\nbetter condition.On entering the hall I paused first before the table\nof toys, fancy work and perfumery.Here was the President, and I hope I\nshall be pardoned for saying that no President since the days of\nWashington can compare with the President of this Society.Then I\nvisited a candy table, and hesitated a long time before deciding which I\nwould rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the charming\ncreatures who sold them.One delicious morsel, in a pink silk, was so\ntempting that I seriously contemplated eating her with a\nspoon--waterfall and all.[By the way, how do we know that the Romans\nwore waterfalls?Because Marc Antony, in his funeral oration on Mr.Caesar, exclaimed, "O water fall was there, my countrymen!"]At this\npoint my attention was attracted by a fish pond.I tried my luck, caught\na whale, and seeing all my friends beginning to blubber, I determined to\nvisit the old woman who lived in a shoe.--She was very glad to see me.I\nbought one of her children, which the Society can redeem for $1,000 in\nsmoking caps.The fried oysters were delicious; a great many of the bivalves got into\na stew, and I helped several of them out.Delicate ice cream, nicely\n"baked in cowld ovens," was destroyed in immense quantities.I scream\nwhen I remember the plates full I devoured, and the number of bright\nwomen to whom I paid my devours.Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant\nHavanas, and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra.The fair\npost-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they were almost\nfairies, drove a very thriving business.--Let no man say hereafter that\nthe young ladies of Canandaigua are uneducated in all that makes women\nlovely and useful.The\nmembers of this Society have won the admiration of all their friends,\nand especially of the most devoted of their servants,\n                                                            Q. E. D.\n\nIf I had written that article, I should have given the praise to Susie\nDaggett, for it belongs to her._Sunday, June_ 24.--My Sunday School scholars are learning the shorter\ncatechism.One recited thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another\ntwenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.They do\nnot see why it is called the "shorter" Catechism!They all had their\nambrotypes taken with me yesterday at Finley\'s--Mary Hoyt, Fannie and\nElla Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw\nand Katie Neu.They are all going to dress in white and sit on the front\nseat in church at my wedding.Gooding make\nindividual fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each member of\nour sewing society._Thursday, June_ 21.--We went to a lawn fete at Mrs.F. F. Thompson\'s\nthis afternoon.The flowers, the grounds, the\nyoung people and the music all combined to make the occasion perfect._Note:_ Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.Thompson, who has\npreviously given the village a children\'s playground, a swimming school,\na hospital and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented a\npark as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua Lake._June_ 28.--Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams were married in the\nCongregational church this evening.The church was trimmed beautifully\nand Abbie looked sweet.We attended the reception afterwards at her\nhouse."May calm and sunshine hallow their clasped hands."_July_ 15.--The girls of the Society have sent me my flag bed quilt,\nwhich they have just finished.It was hard work quilting such hot days\nbut it is done beautifully.Bessie Seymour wrote the names on the stars.In the center they used six stars for "Three rousing cheers for the\nUnion."The names on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie\nPaul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett, Fannie Pierce, Sarah\nAndrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie Williams, Carrie Lamport, Isadore Blodgett,\nNannie Corson, Laura Chapin, Mary F. Fiske, Lucilla F. Pratt, Jennie H.\nHazard, Sarah H. Foster, Mary Jewett, Mary C. Stevens, Etta Smith,\nCornelia Richards, Ella Hildreth, Emma Wheeler, Mary Wheeler, Mrs.Pierce, Alice Jewett, Bessie Seymour, Clara Coleman, Julia Phelps.It\nkept the girls busy to get Abbie Clark\'s quilt and mine finished within\none month.They hope that the rest of the girls will postpone their\nnuptials till there is a change in the weather.Mercury stands 90\ndegrees in the shade._July_ 19, 1866.--Our wedding day.We saw the dear little Grandmother,\nGod bless her, watching us from the window as we drove away.Alexandria Bay, _July_ 26.--Anna writes me that Charlie Wells said he\nhad always wanted a set of Clark\'s Commentaries, but I had carried off\nthe entire Ed._July_ 28.--As we were changing boats at Burlington, Vt, for Saratoga,\nto our surprise, we met Captain and Abbie Williams, but could only stop\na moment.Saratoga, 29_th._--We heard Rev.Theodore Cuyler preach to-day from the\ntext, "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."He\nleads devotional exercises every morning in the parlors of the Columbian\nHotel.I spoke to him this morning and he said my father was one of his\nbest and earliest friends.Canandaigua, _September_ 1.--A party of us went down to the Canandaigua\nhotel this morning to see President Johnson, General Grant and Admiral\nFarragut and other dignitaries.The train stopped about half an hour and\nthey all gave brief speeches.1867\n\n_July_ 27.--Col.James M. Bull was buried from the home of Mr.Alexander\nHowell to-day, as none of his family reside here now._November_ 13.--Our brother John and wife and baby Pearl have gone to\nLondon, England, to live._December_ 28.--A large party of Canandaiguans went over to Rochester\nlast evening to hear Charles Dickens\' lecture, and enjoyed it more than\nI can possibly express.He was quite hoarse and had small bills\ndistributed through the Opera House with the announcement:\n\n                    MR.CHARLES DICKENS\n\n    Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its effects\n    may not be very perceptible after a few minutes\' Reading.We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.It was worth a great deal just to look upon the man\nwho wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the other books,\nwhich have delighted us so much.We hope that he will live to write a\ngreat many more.He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic\nreception in this country and almost apologized for some of the opinions\nthat he had expressed in his "American Notes," which he published, after\nhis first visit here, twenty-five years ago.He evidently thinks that\nthe United States of America are quite worth while.1871\n\n_August_ 6.--Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A., Hon.George H. Stuart,\nPresident of the U. S. Christian Commission, spoke in an open air\nmeeting on the square this afternoon and in our church this evening.The\nhouse was packed and such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips.He\nought to be called the Whitefield of America.He told of the good the\nChristian Commission had done before the war and since.They took up a collection which must have amounted to\nhundreds of dollars.1872\n\n_Naples, June._--John has invited Aunt Ann Field, and James, his wife\nand me and Babe Abigail to come to England to make them a visit, and we\nexpect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.Baltic, July_ 7.--We left New York yesterday under\nfavorable circumstances.It was a beautiful summer day, flags were\nflying and everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we were leaving\nhome and native land.There were many passengers, among them being Mr.Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded the steamer\nfrom a tug boat which came down the bay alongside when we had been out\nhalf an hour.President Grant was with him and stood on deck, smoking\nthe proverbial cigar.We were glad to see him and the passengers gave\nhim three cheers and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm._Liverpool, July_ 16.--We arrived here to-day, having been just ten days\non the voyage.There were many clergymen of note on board, among them,\nRev.John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,\nwho is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our\ntable and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They\nheld services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the\nsteamer, and also in the steerage where the text was "And they willingly\nreceived him into the ship."The immigrants listened eagerly, when the\nminister urged them all to "receive Jesus."We enjoyed several evening\nliterary entertainments, when it was too cold or windy to sit on deck.We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner to-night, that I ever\nate.So large and red and ripe, with the hulls on and we dipped them in\npowdered sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way._London, July_ 17.--On our way to London to-day I noticed beautiful\nflower beds at every station, making our journey almost a path of roses.In the fields, men and women both, were harvesting the hay, making\npicturesque scenes, for the sky was cloudless and I was reminded of the\nold hymn, commencing\n\n    "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\n    Stand dressed in living green."We performed the journey from Liverpool to London, a distance of 240\nmiles, in five hours.John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston\nStation, and we were soon whirled away in cabs to 24 Upper Woburn Place,\nTavistock Square, John\'s residence.Dinner was soon ready, a most\nbountiful repast.We spent the remainder of the day visiting and\nenjoying ourselves generally.It seemed so good to be at the end of the\njourney, although we had only two days of really unpleasant weather on\nthe voyage.John and Laura are so kind and hospitable.They have a\nbeautiful home, lovely children and apparently every comfort and luxury\nwhich this world can afford._Sunday, July_ 22.--We went to Spurgeon\'s Tabernacle this morning to\nlisten to this great preacher, with thousands of others.I had never\nlooked upon such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery\nwhere we sat.The pulpit was underneath one gallery, so there seemed as\nmany people over the preacher\'s head, as there were beneath and around\nhim and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.I thought of the\nhymn, "Hark ten thousand harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise\nabove."Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that he used two canes\nand placed one knee on a chair beside him, when preaching.His text was\n"And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth."I found that all I\nhad heard of his eloquence was true._Sunday, July_ 29.--We have spent the entire week sightseeing, taking in\nHyde Park, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, St.Paul\'s Cathedral, the\nTower of London and British Museum.We also went to Madame Tussaud\'s\nexhibition of wax figures and while I was looking in the catalogue for\nthe number of an old gentleman who was sitting down apparently asleep,\nhe got up and walked away!We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London,\nto see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the "Christmas Palace."Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and came\nto see us to-day._August_ 13.--Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping and sightseeing in\nthis great city, my diary has been well nigh forgotten.The descriptive\nletters to home friends have been numerous and knowing that they would\nbe preserved, I thought perhaps they would do as well for future\nreference as a diary kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.Pancras\' bell was tolling and a funeral procession going by, we heard by\ncable of the death of our dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first\nencouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most\ninterested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I\nwould, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in\nmy heart.She has only stepped inside the\ntemple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord\'s entrance\ncall.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It\ndoes not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my\ndear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting\nblessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go\nand smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that "He who\nholds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,\nwould care for us and bring us to our desired haven."She had received\none letter, telling of our safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going\nabout London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna\'s letter came, after ten days, telling us all\nthe sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last\nnight before she was taken ill, and up at the moon and stars and said\nhow beautiful they were.Anna says, "How can I ever write it?Our dear\nlittle Grandmother died on my bed to-day."_August_ 30.--John, Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field\nand I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow\nwhere we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were\nabout to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.Sherman\nof U.S.A.We stopped to look at him and felt like\ntelling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and\nspirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak\na-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at\nInversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the\nTrossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, "All aboard for\nNaples," it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely\nin Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming\ncity, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw\nthe window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also\nvisited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the\nAbbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went\nthrough the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the\nlibrary.Sir Walter\'s chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but\nLaura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for\na moment saying "I am sure, now, he will be clever."We continued our\njourney that night and arrived in London the next morning._Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September_ 9.--Aunt Ann, Laura\'s sister,\nFlorentine Arnold, nurse and two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are\nhere for three weeks on the seashore._September_ 16.--We have visited all the neighboring towns, the graves\nof the Dairyman\'s daughter and little Jane, the young cottager, and the\nscene of Leigh Richmond\'s life and labors.We have enjoyed bathing in\nthe surf, and the children playing in the sands and riding on the\ndonkeys.We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by an old couple, Mr.Tuddenham, down on the esplanade.They serve excellent meals in a\nmost homelike way.We have an abundance of delicious milk and cream\nwhich they tell me comes from "Cowes"!_London, September_ 30.--Anna has come to England to live with John for\nthe present.She came on the Adriatic, arriving September 24.We are so\nglad to see her once more and will do all in our power to cheer her in\nher loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,\narrived here to-day for a few days\' visit.We had rather a stormy\npassage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel\nand he answered me "The H\'Albert H\'Edward, Miss!"This information must\nhave given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached\nCalais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere\nla Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just\nas they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre\nwithout seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer\'s, Le\nJeune, to be "taken" and had a funny time.He queried "Parlez-vous\nFrancais?"I shook my head and asked him "Parlez-vous Anglaise?"at\nwhich query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to\ntell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two\nsizes of pictures and asked me "Le cabinet, le vignette?"I held up my\nfingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to\nmake ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he\nhoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the\nfirst sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed\nto and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said "Tres\nbien, Madame," and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed\n"tres bien."We visited the Tomb of Napoleon to-day._October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I\nenjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue\nfor the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a\nPresbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The\nsinging in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang "Awake my soul\nto joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer\'s praise," it seemed to me\nthat I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in\nthe refrain "His loving kindness, oh how free."The text was "As an\neagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad\nher wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead\nhim and there was no strange God with him."It was a\nwonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we\nnoticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were\nstanding in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of\nSunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I\nhave only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an\nEnglishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being\nso much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, "In America,\nyou have the \'ops, I know, but you haven\'t the Thames water, you know."_Sunday, November_ 3.--We went to hear Rev.He is a new light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival\nSpurgeon and Newman Hall and all the rest.He is like a lion and again\nlike a lamb in the pulpit._Liverpool, November_ 6.--I came down to Liverpool to-day with Abbie and\nnurse, to sail on the Baltic, to-morrow.There were two Englishmen in\nour compartment and hearing Abbie sing "I have a Father in the Promised\nLand," they asked her where her Father lived and she said "In America,"\nand told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then\nthey turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that\nthe latest cable from America was that U.

Y., November_ 20.--We arrived safely in New York on Sunday.Abbie spied her father very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up\nand with glad and happy hearts we returned his "Welcome home."We spent\ntwo days in New York and arrived home safe and sound this evening._November_ 21.--My thirtieth birthday, which we, a reunited family, are\nspending happily together around our own fireside, pleasant memories of\nthe past months adding to the joy of the hour.From the _New York Evangelist_ of August 15, 1872, by Rev."Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,\nwidow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose\nmaiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,\nand of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of\nCanandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived\nnearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of\nwhom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the\nCongregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful\nsupporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the\nsimple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age\nof which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner\nwhich repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning\ngrace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would\nalmost involuntarily \'rise up before her,\' yet loved to be in her\npresence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love\nand peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children\'s\nchildren what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to\nresort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie\nwhich bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a\ndeep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she\nand her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in\nthe church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its\nactivity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good\nwork.While she was well informed in all current events, she most\ndelighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious\nbooks were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her\nbetter thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her\nnever saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited\nthe Master\'s call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock\nof corn fully ripe that cometh in its season."I don\'t think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down\nthings of importance.Noah T. Clarke\'s brother got possession of my\nlittle diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written\non the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:\n\n    "You\'d scarce expect a volume of my size\n    To hold so much that\'s beautiful and wise,\n    And though the heartless world might call me cheap\n    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,\n    And kindly shelter all who toil below,\n    So my future greatness and the good I do\n    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few."I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon\nan old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her\nyouthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, "Try to be somebody," and\non the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for\nunexpected achievement which she could not prevent, "Some must be\ngreat!"*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n1880\n\n_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A. Cummings\nof Oakland, Cal., and has gone there to live.I am sorry to have her go\nso far away, but love annihilates space.There is no real separation,\nexcept in alienation of spirit, and that can never come--to us.THE END\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOKS TO MAKE ELDERS YOUNG AGAIN\n\nBy Inez Haynes Gillmore\n\nPHOEBE AND ERNEST\n\nWith 30 illustrations by R.

Young man, the hand of fate is in this here, mark my\nwords--"\n\nThere was a hush, and the waves of that vast human sea were stilled.A\nman, lean, angular, with coat-tail: flapping-unfolded like a grotesque\nfigure at a side-show.Stooping forward, Abraham Lincoln began to\nspeak, and Stephen Brice hung his head and shuddered.Could this shrill\nfalsetto be the same voice to which he had listened only that morning?Could this awkward, yellow man with his hands behind his back be he whom\nhe had worshipped?Ripples of derisive laughter rose here and there, on\nthe stand and from the crowd.Thrice distilled was the agony of those\nmoments!But what was this feeling that gradually crept over him?The hands were coming around to the\nfront.Suddenly one of them was thrown sharply back, with a determined\ngesture, the head was raised,--and--and his shame was for gotten.But soon he lost even that, for his mind was\ngone on a journey.And when again he came to himself and looked upon\nAbraham Lincoln, this was a man transformed.Nay, it was now a powerful instrument which played strangely on\nthose who heard.Now it rose, and again it fell into tones so low as to\nstart a stir which spread and spread, like a ripple in a pond, until it\nbroke on the very edge of that vast audience."Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,\n   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude\n   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State\n   Constitution?"It was out, at last, irrevocably writ in the recording book of History,\nfor better, for worse.Beyond the reach of politician, committee, or\ncaucus.But what man amongst those who heard and stirred might say that\nthese minutes even now basting into eternity held the Crisis of a nation\nthat is the hope of the world?Not you, Judge Douglas who sit there\nsmiling.Consternation is a stranger in your heart,--but answer the\nquestion if you can.Yes, your nimble wit has helped you out of many a\ntight corner.You do not feel the noose--as yet.You do not guess that\nyour reply will make or mar the fortunes of your country.It is not\nyou who can look ahead two short years and see the ship of Democracy\nsplitting on the rocks at Charleston and at Baltimore, when the power of\nyour name might have steered her safely.One by one he is\ntaking the screws out of the engine which you have invented to run your\nship.Look, he holds them in his hands without mixing them, and shows\nthe false construction of its secret parts.For Abraham Lincoln dealt with abstruse questions in language so limpid\nthat many a farmer, dulled by toil, heard and understood and marvelled.The simplicity of the Bible dwells in those speeches, and they are now\nclassics in our literature.And the wonder in Stephen\'s mind was that\nthis man who could be a buffoon, whose speech was coarse and whose\nperson unkempt, could prove himself a tower of morality and truth.That\nhas troubled many another, before and since the debate at Freeport.That short hour came all too quickly to an end.And as the Moderator\ngave the signal for Mr.Lincoln, it was Stephen\'s big companion who\nsnapped the strain, and voiced the sentiment of those about him.I didn\'t think Abe had it in\nhim."The Honorable Stephen A. Douglas, however, seemed anything but baffled\nas he rose to reply.As he waited for the cheers which greeted him to\ndie out, his attitude was easy and indifferent, as a public man\'s should\nbe.The question seemed not to trouble him in the least.But for Stephen\nBrice the Judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him, even\nas Abraham Lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors,\nand left it punily naked.Standing up, the very person of the Little Giant was contradictory, as\nwas the man himself.But he had the head\nand shoulders of a lion, and even the lion\'s roar.What at contrast the\nring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of Mr.If Stephen expected the Judge to tremble, he was greatly\ndisappointed.As if to show the people\nhow lightly he held his opponent\'s warnings, he made them gape by\nputting things down Mr.Lincoln\'s shirt-front and taking them out of his\nmouth: But it appeared to Stephen, listening with all his might, that\nthe Judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might\nlead one to expect.Was he not among his own Northern Democrats at\nFreeport?And yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his\nhearers "Black Republicans.""Not black," came from the crowd again\nand again, and once a man: shouted, "Couldn\'t you modify it and call\nit brown?"cried the Judge, and dubbed them "Yankees,"\nalthough himself a Vermonter by birth.He implied that most of these\nBlack Republicans desired <DW64> wives.But quick,--to the Question, How was the Little Giant, artful in debate\nas he was, to get over that without offence to the great South?Very\nskillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations.And\nthen, save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees, the grove might\nhave been empty of its thousands, such was the silence that fell.But\ntighter and tighter they pressed against the stand, until it trembled.Oh, Judge, the time of all artful men will come at length.How were you\nto foresee a certain day under the White Dome of the Capitol?Had your\nsight been long, you would have paused before your answer.Had your\nsight been long, you would have seen this ugly Lincoln bareheaded before\nthe Nation, and you are holding his hat.Judge Douglas, this act alone\nhas redeemed your faults.It has given you a nobility of which we did\nnot suspect you.At the end God gave you strength to be humble, and so\nyou left the name of a patriot.Judge, you thought there was a passage between Scylla and Charybdis\nwhich your craftiness might overcome."It matters not," you cried when you answered the Question, "it matters\nnot which way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract\nquestion whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under\nthe Constitution.The people have the lawful means to introduce or to\nexclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist\na day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police\nregulations."Judge Douglas, uneasy will you lie to-night, for you have uttered the\nFreeport Heresy.It only remains to be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster\nHouse after the debate, found Mr.On his knee, in transports\nof delight, was a small boy, and Mr.Lincoln was serenely playing on\nthe child\'s Jew\'s-harp.Standing beside him was a proud father who had\ndragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who was to\nreturn on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible.In a\ncorner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who\nwished to talk about the Question.Lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome\nthat is still, and ever will be, remembered and cherished."Tell Judge Whipple that I have attended to that little matter, Steve,"\nhe said.Lincoln," he exclaimed, "you have had no time."Lincoln replied, "and I think that I am\nwell repaid.Steve," said he, "unless I\'m mightily mistaken, you know a\nlittle more than you did yesterday."Didn\'t you feel sorry for\nme last night?""I never shall again, sir," he said.The wonderful smile, so ready to come and go, flickered and went out.In\nits stead on the strange face was ineffable sadness,--the sadness of the\nworld\'s tragedies, of Stephen stoned, of Christ crucified."Pray God that you may feel sorry for me again," he said.Awed, the child on his lap was still.Lincoln had kept Stephen\'s hand in his own."I have hopes of you, Stephen," he said.Why was it that he walked to the station with a\nheavy heart?It was a sense of the man he had left, who had been and was\nto be.This Lincoln of the black loam, who built his neighbor\'s cabin\nand hoed his neighbor\'s corn, who had been storekeeper and postmaster\nand flat-boatman.Who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice\naround a rough circuit; who had rolled a local bully in the dirt;\nrescued women from insult; tended the bedside of many a sick coward who\nfeared the Judgment; told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight (but\nthese are pure beside the vice of great cities); who addressed political\nmobs in the raw, swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers\neast and west.This physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the\nNation in her agony; whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse, and\nwhose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing.So was it that, the Physician Himself performed His cures, and when work\nwas done, died a martyr.Abraham Lincoln died in His name\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.GLENCOE\n\nIt was nearly noon when Stephen walked into the office the next day,\ndusty and travel-worn and perspiring.He had come straight from the\nferry, without going home.And he had visions of a quiet dinner with\nRichter under the trees at the beer-garden, where he could talk about\nAbraham Lincoln.But the young German met him at the top of the stair--and his face was\nmore serious than usual, although he showed his magnificent teeth in a\nsmile of welcome."You are a little behind your time, my friend," said he, "What has\nhappened you?""Ah, I know not," he answered, "He has gone is Glencoe.Doctor Polk says that he has worked all his life too hard.The Doctor and Colonel Carvel tried to get him to go to Glencoe.But\nhe would not budge until Miss Carvel herself comes all the way from the\ncountry yesterday, and orders him.exclaimed Richter, impulsively,\n"what wonderful women you have in America!I could lose my head when I\nthink of Miss Carvel.""Miss Carvel was here, you say?"said Richter, disgusted, "you don\'t care."And becoming grave again, added: "Except on\nJudge Whipple\'s account.Have you heard from him to-day, Carl?""This morning one of Colonel Carvel\'s servants came for his letters.I--I pray that he is better," said Richter, his\nvoice breaking.But he had been conscious all at once of an\naffection for the Judge of which he had not suspected himself.That\nafternoon, on his way home, he stopped at Carvel & Company\'s to inquire.Hopper said, and added that he "presumed\nlikely the Colonel would not be in for a week."Eliphalet was actually in the Colonel\'s sanctum behind the partition,\ngiving orders to several clerks at the time.He was so prosperous and\nimportant that he could scarce spare a moment to answer Stephen, who\nwent away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law.On Monday, when Stephen called at Carvel & Company\'s, Eliphalet was too\nbusy to see him.But Ephum, who went out to Glencoe every night with\norders, told him that the "Jedge was wuss, suh."On Wednesday, there\nbeing little change, Mrs.Brice ventured to despatch a jelly by Ephum.On Friday afternoon, when Stephen was deep in Whittlesey and the New\nCode, he became aware of Ephum standing beside him.In reply to his\nanxious question Ephum answered:\n\n"I reckon he better, suh.He an\' de Colonel done commence wrastlin\'\n\'bout a man name o\' Linkum.De Colonel done wrote you dis note, suh."It was a very polite note, containing the Colonel\'s compliments, asking\nMr.Brice to Glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the\nJudge might wish to see.And since there was no convenient train in the\nevening, Colonel Carvel would feel honored if Mr.The Missouri side of the Mississippi is a very different country from\nthe hot and treeless prairies of Illinois.As Stephen alighted at the\nlittle station at Glencoe and was driven away by Ned in the Colonel\'s\nbuggy, he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the Meramec Valley.There had been a shower, and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and\nflowers, and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road.At last they\ncame to a white gate in the picket fence, in sight of a rambling wooden\nhouse with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle.And then he saw\nthe Colonel, in white marseilles, smoking a cigar.As Stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward\nthe house, Colonel Carvel rose to his full height and greeted him."You are very welcome, sir," he said gravely."The Judge is asleep now,"\nhe added."I regret to say that we had a little argument this morning,\nand my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again to-day.Jinny is reading to him now, or she would be here to entertain you, Mr.Jackson appeared hurriedly, seized Stephen\'s bag, and led the way\nupstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on\nthe south side, with matting, and roses on the simple dressing-table.After he had sat awhile staring at these, and at the wet flower-garden\nfrom between the slats of his shutters, he removed the signs of the\nrailroad upon him, and descended.The Colonel was still on the porch, in\nhis easy-chair.He had lighted another, cigar, and on the stand beside\nhim stood two tall glasses, green with the fresh mint.Colonel Carvel\nrose, and with his own hand offered one to Stephen.Brice," he said, "and I hope you will feel at home\nhere, sir.Jackson will bring you anything you desire, and should you\nwish to drive, I shall be delighted to show you the country."Stephen drank that julep with reverence, and then the Colonel gave him\na cigar.He was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young\nYankee.The Colonel did not talk politics--such was not his notion of\nhospitality to a stranger.He talked horse, and no great discernment on\nStephen\'s part was needed to perceive that this was Mr."I used to have a stable, Mr.Brice, before they ruined gentleman\'s\nsport with these trotters ten years ago.Yes sir, we used to be at\nLexington one week, and Louisville the next, and over here on the Ames\ntrack after that.Did you ever hear of Water Witch and Netty Boone?""Why, sir," he cried, "that very <DW65>, Ned, who drove you here from\nthe cars-he used to ride Netty Boone.He was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the Elleardsville track\nhere.He wore my yellow and green, sir, until he got to weigh one\nhundred and a quarter.And I kept him down to that weight a whole year,\nMr.I had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with\nholes bored in the seat.Then we lighted a spirit lamp under him.Many\na time I took off ten pounds that way.It needs fire to get flesh off a\n<DW65>, sir."He didn\'t notice his guest\'s amazement."Then, sir," he continued, "they introduced these damned trotting races;\ntrotting races are for white trash, Mr.I wish you\ncould have seen Miss Virginia Carvel as he saw her then.A tea-tray was in her hand, and her head was tilted\nback, as women are apt to do when they carry a burden.It was so that\nthese Southern families, who were so bitter against Abolitionists and\nYankees, entertained them when they were poor, and nursed them when they\nwere ill.Stephen, for his life, could not utter a word.But Virginia turned to\nhim with perfect self-possession."He has been boring you with his horses, Mr."Has he\ntold you what a jockey Ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and\na quarter?""Has he given you the points of Water Witch and\nNetty Boone?""Pa, I tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this\nhouse.O that you might have a notion of the way in which Virginia pronounced\nintolerable.Carvel reached for another cigar asked, "My dear," he asked, "how is\nthe Judge?""My dear," said Virginia, smiling, "he is asleep.Mammy Easter is with\nhim, trying to make out what he is saying.He talks in his sleep, just\nas you do--"\n\n"And what is he saying?""\'A house divided against itself,\'" said Miss Carvel, with a sweep of\nher arm, "\'cannot stand.I believe that this Government cannot endure\npermanently, half slave and half free.I do not expect the Union to\ndissolve--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will\ncease to be divided.\'"No," cried the Colonel, and banged his fist down on the table."Why,"\nsaid he, thoughtfully, stroking the white goatee on his chin, "cuss me\nif that ain\'t from the speech that country bumpkin, Lincoln, made in\nJune last before the Black Republican convention in Illinois."And Stephen was very near it, for\nhe loved the Colonel.That gentleman suddenly checked himself in his\ntirade, and turned to him."I beg your pardon, sir," he said; "I reckon that you have the same\npolitical sentiments as the Judge.Believe me, sir, I would not\nwillingly offend a guest.""I am not offended, sir," he said.Carvel to bestow a quick glance upon him."You will pardon my absence for a while, sir," he said.In silence they watched him as he strode off under the trees through\ntall grass, a yellow setter at his heels.The shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long, and\na rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air.From a cabin\nbehind the house was wafted the melody of a plantation song.To\nthe young man, after the burnt city, this was paradise.And then he\nremembered his mother as she must be sitting on the tiny porch in\ntown, and sighed.Only two years ago she had been at their own place at\nWestbury.He looked up, and saw the girl watching him.He dared not think that the\nexpression he caught was one of sympathy, for it changed instantly."I am afraid you are the silent kind, Mr.Brice," said she; "I believe\nit is a Yankee trait.""I have known a great many who were not," said he, "When they are\ngarrulous, they are very much so.""I should prefer a garrulous one," said Virginia."I should think a Yankee were bad enough, but a noisy Yankee not to be\nput up with," he ventured.Virginia did not deign a direct reply to this, save by the corners of\nher mouth."I wonder," said she, thoughtfully, "whether it is strength of mind or a\nlack of ideas that makes them silent.""It is mostly prudence," said Mr."Prudence is our dominant\ntrait.""You have not always shown it," she said, with an innocence which in\nwomen is often charged with meaning.He would have liked\ngreatly to know whether she referred to his hasty purchase of Hester, or\nto his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before."We have something left to be thankful for," he answered."We are still\ncapable of action.""On occasions it is violence," said Virginia, desperately.This man must\nnot get ahead of her."It is just as violent," said he, "as the repressed feeling which\nprompts it."This was a new kind of conversation to Virginia.Of all the young men\nshe knew, not one had ever ventured into anything of the sort.They were\neither flippant, or sentimental, or both.She was at once flattered\nand annoyed, flattered, because, as a woman, Stephen had conceded her\na mind.Many of the young men she knew had minds, but deemed that these\nwere wasted on women, whose language was generally supposed to be a kind\nof childish twaddle.Even Jack Brinsmade rarely risked his dignity\nand reputation at an intellectual tilt.This was one of Virginia\'s\ngrievances.She often argued with her father, and, if the truth were\ntold, had had more than one victory over Judge Whipple.Virginia\'s annoyance came from the fact that she perceived in Stephen\na natural and merciless logic,--a faculty for getting at the bottom\nof things.His brain did not seem to be thrown out of gear by local\nmagnetic influences,--by beauty, for instance.He did not lose his head,\nas did some others she knew, at the approach of feminine charms.Here\nwas a grand subject, then, to try the mettle of any woman.One with\nless mettle would have given it up.But Virginia thought it would be\ndelightful to bring this particular Yankee to his knees; and--and leave\nhim there.Brice," she said, "I have not spoken to you since the night of my\nparty."Yes, we did," said he, "and I called, but was unfortunate."Now Miss Carvel was complacency itself."Jackson is so careless with cards," said she, "and very often I do not\ntake the trouble to read them.""I am sorry," said he, "as I wished for the opportunity to tell you how\nmuch I enjoyed myself.She remembered how, she had opposed his\nconing.But honesty as well as something else prompted her to say: "It\nwas my father who invited you."Stephen did not reveal the shock his vanity had received."At least you were good enough to dance with me.""I could scarcely refuse a guest," she replied."Had I thought it would have given you annoyance," he said quietly, "I\nshould not have asked you.""Which would have been a lack of good manners," said Virginia, biting\nher lips.Stephen answered nothing, but wished himself in St.He could not\ncomprehend her cruelty.But, just then, the bell rang for supper, and\nthe Colonel appeared around the end of the house.It was one of those suppers for which the South is renowned.And when\nat length he could induce Stephen to eat no more, Colonel Carvel reached\nfor his broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat smoking, with his feet against\nthe mantle.Virginia, who had talked but little, disappeared with a tray\non which she had placed with her own hands some dainties to tempt the\nJudge.The Colonel regaled Stephen, when she was gone, with the pedigree and\nperformance of every horse he had had in his stable.And this was a\nrelief, as it gave him an opportunity to think without interruption upon\nVirginia\'s pronounced attitude of dislike.To him it was inconceivable\nthat a young woman of such qualities as she appeared to have, should\nassail him so persistently for freeing a negress, and so depriving her\nof a maid she had set her heart upon.There were other New England young\nmen in society.They were not\nher particular friends, to be sure.But they called on her and danced\nwith her, and she had shown them not the least antipathy.But it was to\nStephen\'s credit that he did not analyze her further.He was reflecting on these things when he got to his room, when there\ncame a knock at the door.It was Mammy Easter, in bright turban and\napron,--was hospitality and comfort in the flesh."Is you got all you need, suh?"But Mammy showed no inclination to go, and\nhe was too polite to shut the door:\n\n"How you like Glencoe, Mistah Bride?""We has some of de fust fam\'lies out heah in de summer," said she."But\nde Colonel, he a\'n\'t much on a gran\' place laik in Kaintuck.Shucks, no,\nsuh, dis ain\'t much of a\'stablishment!Young Massa won\'t have no lawns,\nno greenhouses, no nothin\'.He say he laik it wil\' and simple.He on\'y\ncome out fo\' two months, mebbe.But Miss Jinny, she make it lively.Las\'\nweek, until the Jedge come we hab dis house chuck full, two-three young\nladies in a room, an\' five young gemmen on trunnle beds."Den Miss Jinny low dey all hatter go.She say she a\'n\'t\ngwineter have \'em noun\'\'sturbin\' a sick man.He\ndone give the Judge his big room, and he say he and de young men gwine\nober to Mista, Catherwood\'s.You a\'n\'t never seen Miss Jinny rise up,\nsuh!She des swep\' \'em all out" (Mammy emphasized this by rolling her\nhands) "an\' declah she gwine ten\' to the Jedge herself.She a\'n\'t never\nlet me bring up one of his meals, suh."And so she left Stephen with\nsome food for reflection.Virginia was very gay at breakfast, and said that the Judge would see\nStephen; so he and the Colonel, that gentleman with his hat on, went\nup to his room.The shutters were thrown open, and the morning sunlight\nfiltered through the leaves and fell on the four-poster where the Judge\nsat up, gaunt and grizzled as ever.He smiled at his host, and then\ntried to destroy immediately the effect of the smile."Well, Judge," cried the Colonel, taking his hand, "I reckon we talked\ntoo much.""No such thing, Carvel," said the Judge, forcibly, "if you hadn\'t\nleft the room, your popular sovereignty would have been in rags in two\nminutes."Stephen sat down in a corner, unobserved, in expectation of a renewal.But at this moment Miss Virginia swept into the room, very cool in a\npink muslin."Colonel Carvel," said she, sternly, "I am the doctor\'s deputy here.I\nwas told to keep the peace at any cost.And if you answer back, out you\ngo, like that!"But the Judge, whose mind was on the argument,\ncontinued to mutter defiantly until his eye fell upon Stephen."Well, sir, well, sir," he said, "you\'ve turned up at last, have you?I send you off with papers for a man, and I get back a piece of yellow\npaper saying that he\'s borrowed you."He took me to Freeport, sir, where I listened to the most remarkable\nspeech I ever expect to hear."cried the Judge, "so far from Boston?"Stephen hesitated, uncertain whether to laugh, until he chanced to look\nat Virginia."I was very much surprised, sir," he said.Whipple, "and what did you chink of that ruffian,\nLincoln?""He is the most remarkable man that I have ever met, sir," answered\nStephen, with emphasis.It seemed as if the grunt this time had in it something of approval.Stephen had doubt as to the propriety of discussing Mr.Lincoln there,\nand he reddened.Virginia\'s expression bore a trace of defiance, and Mr.Carvel stood with his feet apart, thoughtfully stroking his goatee.Whipple seemed to have no scruples."You must agree with\nthat laudatory estimation of him which I read in the Missouri Democrat.""I do, sir, most decidedly," he answered."I should hardly expect a conservative Bostonian, of the class which\nrespects property, to have said that.It might possibly be a good thing\nif more from your town could hear those debates.""They will read them, sir; I feel confident of it."At this point the Colonel could contain himself no longer."I reckon I might tell the man who wrote that Democrat article a few\nthings, if I could find out who he is," said he.But Stephen had turned a fiery red, "I wrote it, Colonel Carvel," he\nsaid.For a dubious instant of silence Colonel Carvel stared.Then--then he\nslapped his knees, broke into a storm of laughter, and went out of the\nroom.He left Stephen in a moist state of discomfiture.The Judge had bolted upright from the pillows."You have been neglecting your law, sir," he cried."I wrote the article at night," said Stephen, indignantly."Then it must have been Sunday night, Mr.At this point Virginia hid her face in her handkerchief which trembled\nvisibly.Being a woman, whose ways are unaccountable, the older man took\nno notice of her.But being a young woman, and a pretty one, Stephen was\nangry."I don\'t see what right you have to ask me that sir," he said.Brice," said the Judge, "Virginia, you\nmay strike it from the records.And now, sir, tell me something about\nyour trip."An hour later Stephen descended to the veranda, and it was with\napprehension that he discerned Mr.Carvel seated under the vines at the\nfar end.To Stephen\'s surprise the Colonel rose, and, coming toward him, laid a\nkindly hand on his shoulder."Stephen," said he, "there will be no law until Monday you must stay\nwith us until then.I shall have to go by the two o\'clock train, I\nfear."The Colonel turned to Virginia, who, meanwhile, had sat silently by."Jinny," he said, "we must contrive to keep him.""I\'m afraid he is determined, Pa," she answered.Brice\nwould like to see a little of the place before he goes.It is very\nprimitive," she explained, "not much like yours in the East."Stephen thanked her, and bowed to the Colonel.And so she led him past\nthe low, crooked outbuildings at the back, where he saw old Uncle\nBen busy over the preparation of his dinner, and frisky Rosetta, his\ndaughter, playing with one of the Colonel\'s setters.Then Virginia took\na well-worn path, on each side of which the high grass bent with its\nload of seed, which entered the wood.Oaks and hickories and walnuts\nand persimmons spread out in a glade, and the wild grape twisted\nfantastically around the trunks.All this beauty seemed but a fit\nsetting to the strong girlish figure in the pink frock before him.So absorbed was he in contemplation of this, and in wondering whether\nindeed she were to marry her cousin, Clarence Colfax, that he did not\nsee the wonders of view unrolling in front of him.She stopped at length\nbeside a great patch of wild race bushes.They were on the edge of the\nbluff, and in front of them a little rustic summer-house, with seats on\nits five sides.But Stephen, going to the edge,\nstood and marvelled.Far, far below him, down the wooded steep, shot\nthe crystal Meramec, chafing over the shallow gravel beds and tearing\nheadlong at the deep passes.Beyond, the dimpled green hills rose and fell, and the stream ran indigo\nand silver.A hawk soared over the water, the only living creature in\nall that wilderness.And when at length he turned,\nhe saw that the girl was watching him.Virginia had taken other young men here, and they had looked only upon\nher.This sincerity now was as new to her\nas that with which he had surprised her in the Judge\'s room.A reply to those simple words of his\nwas impossible.At honest Tom Catherwood in the same situation she would\nhave laughed, Clarence never so much as glanced at scenery.Her replies\nto him were either flippant, or else maternal, as to a child.A breeze laden with the sweet abundance of that valley stirred her hair.And with that womanly gesture which has been the same through the ages\nshe put up her hand; deftly tucking in the stray wisp behind.She glanced at the New Englander, against whom she had been in strange\nrebellion since she had first seen him.His face, thinned by the summer\nin town, was of the sternness of the Puritan.Stephen\'s features were\nsharply marked for his age.Yet justice\nwas in the mouth, and greatness of heart.Conscience was graven on the\nbroad forehead.The eyes were the blue gray of the flint, kindly yet\nimperishable.Struggling, then yielding to the impulse, Virginia let herself be led on\ninto the years.Sanity was the word that best described him.She saw him\ntrusted of men, honored of women, feared by the false.She saw him in\nhigh places, simple, reserved, poised evenly as he was now."I wish that I might stay," he said regretfully."But I cannot, Miss\nCarvel."Never before had she\nstooped to urge young men to stay.The difficulty had always been to get\nthem to go.It was natural, perhaps, that her vanity was wounded.But it\nhurt her to think that she had made the overture, had tried to conquer\nwhatever it was that set her against him, and had failed through him.Perhaps," she added, with a little\nlaugh, "perhaps it is Bellefontaine Road.""Then" (with a touch of derision), "then it is because you cannot miss\nan afternoon\'s work."I was not always that kind," he answered.But now I have to or--or starve," he said.For the second time his complete simplicity had disarmed her.He had not\nappealed to her sympathy, nor had he hinted at the luxury in which he\nwas brought up.She would have liked to question Stephen on this former\nlife."I thought him the ugliest man I ever saw, and the handsomest as well.""You believe with him that this government cannot exist half slave and\nhalf free.Brice, when you and I shall be\nforeigners one to the other.""You have forgotten," he said eagerly, "you have forgotten the rest\nof the quotation.\'I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not\nexpect the house to fall--but cease to be divided.\'It will become all\none thing or all the other.""That seemed to me very equivocal," said she."Your\nrail-sputter is well named.""Will you read the rest of that speech?"he asked\n\n"Judge Whipple is very clever.He has made a convert of you," she\nanswered."The Judge has had nothing to do with it," cried Stephen."He is not\ngiven to discussion with me, and until I went to Springfield had never\nmentioned Lincoln\'s name to me."Glancing at her, he surprised a sparkle of amusement in her eyes."Why do you suppose that you were sent to Springfield?""And that most important communication was--your self.There, now, I\nhave told you," said Virginia."Then you haven\'t the sense I thought you had," she replied impatiently."Do you know what was in that note?Well, a year ago last June this\nBlack Republican lawyer whom you are all talking of made a speech before\na convention in Illinois.Judge Whipple has been crazy on the subject\never since--he talks of Lincoln in his sleep; he went to Springfield and\nspent two days with him, and now he can\'t rest until you have seen and\nknown and heard him.So he writes a note to Lincoln and asks him to take\nyou to the debate--"\n\nShe paused again to laugh at his amazement."But he told me to go to Springfield!"He knew that you would obey his orders, I\nsuppose.""But I didn\'t know--" Stephen began, trying to come pass within an\ninstant the memory of his year\'s experience with Mr."You didn\'t know that he thought anything about you," said Virginia.He has more private charities on his list\nthan any man in the city except Mr.He\nthinks a great deal of you.But there," she added, suddenly blushing\ncrimson, "I am sorry I told you."She did not answer, but sat tapping the seat with her fingers.And when\nshe ventured to look at him, he had fallen into thought."I think it must be time for dinner," said Virginia, "if you really wish\nto catch the train."The coldness in her voice, rather than her words, aroused him.He rose,\ntook one lingering look at the river, and followed her to the house.At dinner, when not talking about his mare, the Colonel was trying\nto persuade Stephen to remain.Virginia did not join in this, and\nher father thought the young man\'s refusal sprang from her lack of\ncordiality.Colonel Carvel himself drove to the station.When he returned, he found his daughter sitting idly on the porch."I like that young man, if he is a Yankee," he declared."I don\'t," said Virginia, promptly."My dear," said her father, voicing the hospitality of the Carvels,\n"I am surprised at you.One should never show one\'s feelings toward a\nguest.As mistress of this house it was your duty to press him to stay.""Do you know why he went, my dear," asked the Colonel."He said that his mother was alone in town, and needed him."Virginia got up without a word, and went into Judge Whipple\'s room.And there the Colonel found her some hours later, reading aloud from a\nscrap-book certain speeches of Mr.Lincoln\'s which Judge Whipple had cut\nfrom newspapers.And the Judge, lying back with his eyes half closed,\nwas listening in pure delight.Little did he guess at Virginia\'s\npenance!AN EXCURSION\n\nI am going ahead two years.Two years during which a nation struggled\nin agony with sickness, and even the great strength with which she was\nendowed at birth was not equal to the task of throwing it off.In 1620\na Dutch ship had brought from Guinea to his Majesty\'s Colony of Virginia\nthe germs of that disease for which the Nation\'s blood was to be let\nso freely.During these years signs of dissolution, of death, were not\nwanting.In the city by the Father of Waters where the races met, men and women\nwere born into the world, who were to die in ancient Cuba, who were to\nbe left fatherless in the struggle soon to come, who were to live to\nsee new monsters rise to gnaw at the vitals of the Republic, and to\nhear again the cynical laugh of Europe.But they were also to see their\ncountry a power in the world, perchance the greatest power.While Europe\nhad wrangled, the child of the West had grown into manhood and taken\na seat among the highest, to share with them the responsibilities of\nmanhood.Meanwhile, Stephen Brice had been given permission to practise law\nin the sovereign state of Missouri.It cannot be said that he was intimate with that rather\nformidable personage, although the Judge, being a man of habits, had\nformed that of taking tea at least once a week with Mrs.Stephen\nhad learned to love the Judge, and he had never ceased to be grateful to\nhim for a knowledge of that man who had had the most influence upon his\nlife,--Abraham Lincoln.For the seed, sowed in wisdom and self-denial, was bearing fruit.The\nsound of gathering conventions was in the land, and the Freeport Heresy\nwas not for gotten.We shall not mention the number of clients thronging to Mr.Some of\nStephen\'s income came from articles in the newspapers of that day.What funny newspapers they were, the size of a blanket!No startling\nheadlines such as we see now, but a continued novel among the\nadvertisements on the front page and verses from some gifted lady of\nthe town, signed Electra.And often a story of pure love, but more\nfrequently of ghosts or other eerie phenomena taken from a magazine, or\nan anecdote of a cat or a chicken.There were letters from citizens who\nhad the mania of print, bulletins of different ages from all parts of\nthe Union, clippings out of day-before-yesterday\'s newspaper of Chicago\nor Cincinnati to three-weeks letters from San Francisco, come by the\npony post to Lexington and then down the swift Missouri.Of course,\nthere was news by telegraph, but that was precious as fine gold,--not to\nbe lightly read and cast aside.In the autumn of \'59, through the kindness of Mr.Brinsmade, Stephen had\ngone on a steamboat up the river to a great convention in Iowa.On this\nexcursion was much of St.He widened his circle\nof acquaintances, and spent much of his time walking the guards between\nMiss Anne Brinsmade and Miss Puss Russell.Perhaps it is unfair to these\nyoung ladies to repeat what they said about Stephen in the privacy of\ntheir staterooms, gentle Anne remonstrating that they should not gossip,\nand listening eagerly the while, and laughing at Miss Puss, whose\nmimicry of Stephen\'s severe ways brought tears to her eyes.Clarence Colfax was likewise on the boat, and passing Stephen on the\nguards, bowed distantly.But once, on the return trip, when Stephen had\na writing pad on his knee, the young Southerner came up to him in his\nfrankest manner and with an expression of the gray eyes which was not to\nbe withstood."I hear you are the kind that cannot be\nidle even on a holiday.""Not as bad as all that," replied Stephen, smiling at him."Reckon you keep a diary, then," said Clarence, leaning against the\nrail.He made a remarkably graceful figure, Stephen thought.He was\ntall, and his movements had what might be called a commanding indolence.Stephen, while he smiled, could not but admire the tone and gesture with\nwhich Colfax bade a passing <DW64> to get him a handkerchief from his\ncabin.The alacrity of the black to do the errand was amusing enough.Stephen well knew it had not been such if he wanted a handkerchief.Colfax was too well bred to inquire\nfurther; so he never found out that Mr.Brice was writing an account of\nthe Convention and the speechmaking for the Missouri Democrat."Brice," said the Southerner, "I want to apologize for things I\'ve done\nto you and said about you.I hated you for a long time after you beat me\nout of Hester, and--" he hesitated.For the first time he actually liked Colfax.He had\nbeen long enough among Colfax\'s people to understand how difficult it\nwas for him to say the thing he wished."You may remember a night at my uncle\'s, Colonel Carvel\'s, on the\noccasion of my cousin\'s birthday?""Well," blurted Clarence, boyishly, "I was rude to you in my uncle\'s\nhouse, and I have since been sorry.""He held out his hand, and Stephen took it warmly.Colfax," he said, "and I didn\'t understand your\npoint of view as well as I do now.Not that I have changed my ideas," he\nadded quickly, "but the notion of the girl\'s going South angered me.I\nwas bidding against the dealer rather than against you.Had I then known\nMiss Carvel--" he stopped abruptly.The winning expression died from the face of the other.He turned away, and leaning across the rail, stared at the high bluffs,\nred-bronzed by the autumn sun.A score of miles beyond that precipice\nwas a long low building of stone, surrounded by spreading trees,--the\nschool for young ladies, celebrated throughout the West, where our\nmothers and grandmothers were taught,--Monticello.Hither Miss Virginia\nCarvel had gone, some thirty days since, for her second winter.Perhaps Stephen guessed the thought in the mind of his companion, for\nhe stared also.The music in the cabin came to an abrupt pause, and only\nthe tumbling of waters through the planks of the great wheels broke the\nsilence.They were both startled by laughter at their shoulders.There\nstood Miss Russell, the picture of merriment, her arm locked in Anne\nBrinsmade\'s."It is the hour when all devout worshippers turn towards the East," she\nsaid."The goddess is enshrined at Monticello."Both young men, as they got to their feet, were crimson.But this was not\nthe first time Miss Russell had gone too far.Colfax, with the\nexcess of manner which was his at such times, excused himself and left\nabruptly.This to the further embarrassment of Stephen and Anne, and the\nkeener enjoyment of Miss Russell."Why, you are even writing\nverses to her!""I scarcely know Miss Carvel," he said, recovering."And as for writing\nverse--"\n\n"You never did such a thing in your life!Miss Russell made a face in the direction Colfax had taken."He always acts like that when you mention her," she said."But you are so cruel, Puss," said Anne."That has been the way of the world ever since Adam and Eve," remarked\nPuss."I suppose you meant to ask: Mr.Brice, whether Clarence is to\nmarry Virginia Carvel."Brice," Puss continued, undaunted."I shall tell you some\ngossip.Virginia was sent to Monticello, and went with her father to\nKentucky and Pennsylvania this summer, that she might be away from\nClarence."Colonel Carvel is right," she went on.They are first cousins, and the Colonel doesn\'t like that.But he isn\'t good for anything in the world except horse\nracing and--and fighting.He wanted to help drive the Black Republican\nemigrants out of Kansas, and his mother had to put a collar and chain on\nhim.He wanted to go filibustering with Walker, and she had to get down\non her knees.And yet," she cried, "if you Yankees push us as far as\nwar, Mr."Oh, I know what you are going to say,--that Clarence has money.""Come, Anne," she said, "we mustn\'t interrupt the Senator any longer.That was the way in which Stephen got his nickname.It is scarcely\nnecessary to add that he wrote no more until he reached his little room\nin the house on Olive Street.They had passed Alton, and the black cloud that hung in the still autumn\nair over the city was in sight.It was dusk when the \'Jackson\' pushed\nher nose into the levee, and the song of the <DW64> stevedores rose from\nbelow as they pulled the gang-plank on to the landing-stage.Stephen\nstood apart on the hurricane deck, gazing at the dark line of sooty\nwarehouses.How many young men with their way to make have felt the same\nas he did after some pleasant excursion.The presence of a tall form\nbeside him shook him from his revery, and he looked up to recognize the\nbenevolent face of Mr.Brice may be anxious, Stephen, at the late hour," said he."My\ncarriage is here, and it will give me great pleasure to convey you to\nyour door."He is in heaven now, and knows at last the good\nhe wrought upon earth.Of the many thoughtful charities which Stephen\nreceived from him, this one sticks firmest in his remembrance: A\nstranger, tired and lonely, and apart from the gay young men and women\nwho stepped from the boat, he had been sought out by this gentleman, to\nwhom had been given the divine gift of forgetting none."Oh, Puss," cried Anne, that evening, for Miss Russell had come to spend\nthe night, "how could you have talked to him so?He scarcely spoke on\nthe way up in the carriage."Why should I set him upon a pedestal?"said Puss, with a thread in\nher mouth; "why should you all set him upon a pedestal?He is only a\nYankee," said Puss, tossing her head, "and not so very wonderful.""I did not say he was wonderful," replied Anne, with dignity.He had better\nmarry Belle Cluyme.A great man, he may give some decision to that\nfamily."Then--Virginia Carvel is in love with him.""She thinks she hates him," said Miss Russell, calmly.Anne looked up at her companion admiringly.Her two heroines were Puss\nand Virginia.Both had the same kind of daring, but in Puss the trait\nhad developed into a somewhat disagreeable outspokenness which made many\npeople dislike her.Her judgments were usually well founded, and her\nprophecies had so often come to pass that Anne often believed in them\nfor no other reason."Do you remember that September, a year ago, when we were all out at\nGlencoe, and Judge Whipple was ill, and Virginia sent us all away and\nnursed him herself?"Brice had gone out, with letters, when the\nJudge was better?""It was a Saturday afternoon that he left, although they had begged him\nto stay over Sunday.Virginia had written for me to come back, and I\narrived in the evening.I asked Easter where Jinny was, and I found\nher--"\n\n"You found her--?"Sitting alone in the summer-house over the river.Easter said she\nhad been there for two hours.And I have never known Jinny to be such\nmiserable company as she was that night."But you did," said Anne, with conviction.Miss Russell\'s reply was not as direct as usual."You know Virginia never confides unless she wants to," she said."Virginia has scarcely seen him since then," she said."You know that\nI was her room-mate at Monticello last year, and I think I should have\ndiscovered it."I heard her repeat once what Judge\nWhipple told her father of him; that he had a fine legal mind.He was\noften in my letters from home, because they have taken Pa\'s house next\ndoor, and because Pa likes them.I used to read those letters to Jinny,"\nsaid Anne, "but she never expressed any desire to hear them.""I, too, used to write Jinny about him," confessed Puss."No," replied Miss Puss,--"but that was just before the holidays, you\nremember.And then the Colonel hurried her off to see her Pennsylvania\nrelatives, and I believe they went to Annapolis, too, where the Carvels\ncome from."Stephen, sitting in the next house, writing out his account, little\ndreamed that he was the subject of a conference in the third story front\nof the Brinsmades\'.Later, when the young ladies were asleep, he carried\nhis manuscript to the Democrat office, and delivered it into the hands\nof his friend, the night editor, who was awaiting it.Toward the end of that week, Miss Virginia Carvel was sitting with her\nback to one of the great trees at Monticello reading a letter.Every\nonce in a while she tucked it under her cloak and glanced hastily\naround."I have told you all about the excursion, my dear, and how we missed\nyou.You may remember" (ah, Anne, the guile there is in the best of us),\n"you may remember Mr.Stephen Brice, whom we used to speak of.Pa and Ma\ntake a great interest in him, and Pa had him invited on the excursion.He is more serious than ever, since he has become a full-fledged lawyer.But he has a dry humor which comes out when you know him well, of which\nI did not suspect him.His mother is the dearest lady I have ever known,\nso quiet, so dignified, and so well bred.Brice told Pa so many things about the\npeople south of Market Street, the Germans, which he did not know; that\nPa was astonished.He told all about German history, and how they were\npersecuted at home, and why they came here.Pa was surprised to hear\nthat many of them were University men, and that they were already\norganizing to defend the Union.I heard Pa say, \'That is what Mr.Blair\nmeant when he assured me that we need not fear for the city.\'"Jinny dear, I ought not to have written you this, because you are for\nSecession, and in your heart you think Pa a traitor, because he comes\nfrom a slave state and has slaves of his own."It is sad to think how rich Mrs.Brice lived in Boston, and what she\nhas had to come to.One servant and a little house, and no place to go\nto in the summer, when they used to have such a large one.I often go in\nto sew with her, but she has never once mentioned her past to me."Your father has no doubt sent you the Democrat with the account of the\nConvention.It is the fullest published, by far, and was so much admired\nthat Pa asked the editor who wrote it.Who do you think, but Stephen\nBrice!Brice hesitated when Pa asked him to go\nup the river, and then consented.Yesterday, when I\nwent in to see Mrs.Brice, a new black silk was on her bed, and as long\nas I live I shall never forget how sweet was her voice when she said,\n\'It is a surprise from my son, my dear.I did not expect ever to have\nanother.\'Jinny, I just know he bought it with the money he got for the\narticle.That was what he was writing on the boat when Clarence Colfax\ninterrupted him.Puss accused him of writing verses to you."At this point Miss Virginia Carvel stopped reading.Whether she had read\nthat part before, who shall say?But she took Anne\'s letter between her\nfingers and tore it into bits and flung the bits into the wind, so that\nthey were tossed about and lost among the dead leaves under the great\ntrees.And when she reached her room, there was the hated Missouri\nDemocrat lying, still open, on her table.A little later a great black\npiece of it came tossing out of the chimney above, to the affright\nof little Miss Brown, teacher of Literature, who was walking in the\ngrounds, and who ran to the principal\'s room with the story that the\nchimney was afire.THE COLONEL IS WARNED\n\nIt is difficult to refrain from mention of the leave-taking of Miss\nVirginia Carvel from the Monticello "Female Seminary," so called in the\n\'Democrat\'.Most young ladies did not graduate in those days.Stephen chanced to read in the \'Republican\' about these\nceremonies, which mentioned that Miss Virginia Carvel, "Daughter of\nColonel Comyn Carvel, was without doubt the beauty of the day.She\nwore--" but why destroy the picture?The words are meaningless to all males, and young women might laugh at\na critical time.Miss Emily Russell performed upon "that most superb of\nall musical instruments the human voice."Was it \'Auld Robin Gray\' that\nshe sang?I am sure it was Miss Maude Catherwood who recited \'To My\nMother\', with such effect.Miss Carvel, so Stephen learned with alarm,\nwas to read a poem by Mrs.Browning, but was "unavoidably prevented."The truth was, as he heard afterward from Miss Puss Russell, that\nMiss Jinny had refused point blank.So the Lady Principal, to save her\nreputation for discipline, had been forced to deceive the press.There was another who read the account of the exercises with intense\ninterest, a gentleman of whom we have lately forborne to speak.It is to be doubted if\nthat somewhat easy-going gentleman, Colonel Carvel, realized the\nfull importance of Eliphalet to Carvel & Company.Ephum still opened the store in the mornings, but Mr.Hopper was within the ground-glass office before the place was warm, and\nthrough warerooms and shipping rooms, rubbing his hands, to see if any\nwere late.Many of the old force were missed, and a new and greater\nforce were come in.These feared Eliphalet as they did the devil, and\nworked the harder to please him, because Eliphalet had hired that kind.To them the Colonel was lifted high above the sordid affairs of the\nworld.He was at the store every day in the winter, and Mr.Hopper\nalways followed him obsequiously into the ground-glass office, called in\nthe book-keeper, and showed him the books and the increased earnings.Hood and his slovenly management, and sighed,\nin spite of his doubled income.Hopper had added to the Company\'s\nlist of customers whole districts in the growing Southwest, and yet the\nhonest Colonel did not like him.Hopper, by a gradual process,\nhad taken upon his own shoulders, and consequently off the Colonel\'s,\nresponsibility after responsibility.There were some painful scenes,\nof course, such as the departure of Mr.Hood, which never would have\noccurred had not Eliphalet proved without question the incapacity of\nthe ancient manager.Hopper only narrowed his lids when the Colonel\npensioned Mr.But the Colonel had a will before which, when\nroused, even Mr.So that Eliphalet was always polite\nto Ephum, and careful never to say anything in the darkey\'s presence\nagainst incompetent clerks or favorite customers, who, by the charity of\nthe Colonel, remained on his books.One spring day, after the sober home-coming of Colonel Carvel from the\nDemocratic Convention at Charleston, Ephum accosted his master as\nhe came into the store of a morning.Ephum\'s face was working with\nexcitement."What\'s the matter with you, Ephum?""No, Marsa, I ain\'t \'zactly."Ephum put down the duster, peered out of the door of the private office,\nand closed it softly."Marse Comyn, I ain\'t got no use fo\' dat Misteh Hoppa\', Ise kinder\nsup\'stitious \'bout him, Marsa.""Has he treated you badly, Ephum?"The faithful <DW64> saw another question in his master\'s face.He well\nknew that Colonel Carvel would not descend to ask an inferior concerning\nthe conduct of a superior.And I ain\'t sayin\' nuthin\' gin his honesty.He straight,\nbut he powerful sharp, Marse Comyn.An\' he jus\' mussiless down to a\ncent."He realized that which was beyond the grasp of the\n<DW64>\'s mind.New and thriftier methods of trade from New England were\nfast replacing the old open-handedness of the large houses.Competition\nhad begun, and competition is cruel.Edwards, James, & Company had taken\na Yankee into the firm.They were now Edwards, James, & Doddington, and\nMr.Edwards\'s coolness towards the Colonel was manifest since the rise\nof Eliphalet.But Colonel\nCarvel did not know until after years that Mr.Hopper had been offered\nthe place which Mr.Hopper, increase of salary had not changed him.He still\nlived in the same humble way, in a single room in Miss Crane\'s\nboarding-house, and he paid very little more for his board than he had\nthat first week in which he swept out Colonel Carvel\'s store.He\nwas superintendent, now, of Mr.Davitt\'s Sunday School, and a church\nofficer.At night, when he came home from business, he would read the\nwidow\'s evening paper, and the Colonel\'s morning paper at the office.Of\ntrue Puritan abstemiousness, his only indulgence was chewing tobacco.It was as early as 1859 that the teller of the Boatman\'s Bank began to\npoint out Mr.Hopper\'s back to casual customers, and he was more than\nonce seen to enter the president\'s room, which had carpet on the floor.Eliphalet\'s suavity with certain delinquent customers from the Southwest\nwas A wording to Scripture.When they were profane, and invited him\ninto the street, he reminded them that the city had a police force and a\njail.While still a young man, he had a manner of folding his hands\nand smiling which is peculiar to capitalists, and he knew the laws\nconcerning mortgages in several different states.But Eliphalet was content still to remain in the sphere in which\nProvidence had placed him, and so to be an example for many of us.He did not buy, or even hire, an evening suit.He was pleased to\nsuperintend some of the details for a dance at Christmas-time before\nVirginia left Monticello, but he sat as usual on the stair-landing.Jacob Cluyme (who had been that day in conversation with\nthe teller of the Boatman\'s Bank) chanced upon him.Cluyme was so\ncharmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted the rise and fall\nof sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr.And\nfrom this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of\nwhich Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society.If the Cluyme\nhousehold was not polite, it was nothing.Eliphalet sat next to Miss\nBelle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he\ncherished for future use.Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which\n(if the truth were told) needed an apology.All of which is significant,\nbut sordid and uninteresting.Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before\na rise.There was only one person who really bothered Eliphalet as he rose into\nprominence, and that person was Captain Elijah Brent.If, upon entering\nthe ground-glass office, he found Eliphalet without the Colonel,\nCaptain Lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty.The\ninquiries he made were addressed always to Ephum.Hopper\nhad bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him, the honest\nCaptain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or Tenth\nStreet, where he found the Colonel alone at breakfast."Colonel," said he, without an introduction."I don\'t like this here\nbusiness of letting Hopper run your store."Lige," he said gently, "he\'s nearly doubled my income.It isn\'t the old\ntimes, when we all went our own way and kept our old customers year in\nand year out.The Captain took a deep draught of the coffee which Jackson had laid\nbefore him."Colonel Carvel," he said emphatically, "the fellow\'s a damned rascal,\nand will ruin you yet if you don\'t take advice.""The books show that he\'s honest, Lige.""Yes," cried Lige, with his fist on the table.But\nif that fellow ever gets on top of you, or any one else, he\'ll grind you\ninto dust.""He isn\'t likely to get on top of me, Lige.I know the business, and\nkeep watch.And now that Jinny\'s coming home from Monticello, I feel\nthat I can pay more attention to her--kind of take her mother\'s place,"\nsaid the Colonel, putting on his felt hat and tipping his chair."Lige,\nI want that girl to have every advantage.She ought to go to Europe and\nsee the world.That trip East last summer did her a heap of good.When\nwe were at Calvert House, Dan read her something that my grandfather had\nwritten about London, and she was regularly fired.First I must take\nher to the Eastern Shore to see Carvel Hall.The Captain walked over to the window, and said nothing.He did not see\nthe searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him."Lige, why don\'t you give up steamboating and come along to Europe?You\'re not forty yet, and you have a heap of money laid by."The Captain shook his head with the vigor that characterized him."This ain\'t no time for me to leave," he said."Colonel; I tell you\nthere\'s a storm comin\'."The Colonel pulled his goatee uneasily.Here, at last, was a man in whom\nthere was no guile."Lige," he said, "isn\'t it about time you got married?"Upon which the Captain shook his head again, even with more vigor.After the Christmas holidays he had\ndriven Virginia across the frozen river, all the way to Monticello, in a\nsleigh.It was night when they had reached the school, the light of its\nmany windows casting long streaks on the snow under the trees.He had\nhelped her out, and had taken her hand as she stood on the step."Be good, Jinny," he had said."Remember what a short time it will be\nuntil June.And your Pa will come over to see you."She had seized him by the buttons of his great coat, and said tearfully:\n"O Captain Lige!I shall be so lonely when you are away.He had put his lips to her forehead, driven madly back to Alton, and\nspent the night.The first thing he did the next day when he reached\nSt.Louis was to go straight to the Colonel and tell him bluntly of the\ncircumstance."Lige, I\'d hate to give her up," Mr.Carvel said; "but I\'d rather you\'d\nmarry her than any man I can think of."SIGNS OF THE TIMES\n\nIn that spring of 1860 the time was come for the South to make her\nfinal stand.And as the noise of gathering conventions shook the ground,\nStephen Brice was not the only one who thought of the Question at\nFreeport.The hour was now at hand for it to bear fruit.Meanwhile, his hero, the hewer of rails and forger of homely speech,\nAbraham Lincoln, had made a little tour eastward the year before, and\nhad startled Cooper Union with a new logic and a new eloquence.They\nwere the same logic and the same eloquence which had startled Stephen.Even as he predicted who had given it birth, the Question destroyed the\ngreat Democratic Party.Colonel Carvel travelled to the convention in\nhistoric Charleston soberly and fearing God, as many another Southern\ngentleman.In old Saint Michael\'s they knelt to pray for harmony, for\npeace; for a front bold and undismayed toward those who wronged them.All through the week chosen orators wrestled in vain.Judge Douglas,\nyou flattered yourself that you had evaded the Question.Do you see\nthe Southern delegates rising in their seats?Alabama leaves the hall,\nfollowed by her sister stakes.The South has not forgotten your Freeport\nHeresy.Once she loved you now she will have none of you.Gloomily, indeed, did Colonel Carvel return home.He loved the Union and\nthe flag for which his grandfather Richard had fought so bravely.So the Judge, laying his hand upon the knee\nof his friend, reminded him gravely.The\nvery calmness of their argument had been portentous.You of the North are bent upon taking away from us the\nrights we had when our fathers framed the Constitution.However the\n<DW65> got to this country, sir, in your Bristol and Newport traders, as\nwell as in our Virginia and Maryland ships, he is here, and he was here\nwhen the Constitution was written.He is happier in slavery than are\nyour factory hands in New England; and he is no more fit to exercise the\nsolemn rights of citizenship, I say, than the halfbreeds in the South\nAmerican states.""Suppose you deprive me of my few slaves, you do not ruin me.Yet you\ndo me as great a wrong as you do my friend Samuels, of Louisiana, who\ndepends on the labor of five hundred.Shall I stand by selfishly and see\nhim ruined, and thousands of others like him?"Profoundly depressed, Colonel Carvel did not attend the adjourned\nConvention at Baltimore, which split once more on Mason and Dixon\'s\nline.The Democrats of the young Northwest stood for Douglas and\nJohnson, and the solid South, in another hall, nominated Breckenridge\nand Lane.This, of course, became the Colonel\'s ticket.What a Babel of voices was raised that summer!Each with its cure\nfor existing ills.Between the extremes of the Black Republican\n<DW64> Worshippers and the Southern Rights party of Breckenridge, your\nconservative had the choice of two candidates,--of Judge Douglas\nor Senator Bell.A most respectable but practically extinct body of\ngentlemen in ruffled shirts, the Old Line Whigs, had likewise met\nin Baltimore.A new name being necessary, they called themselves\nConstitutional Unionists Senator Bell was their candidate, and they\nproposed to give the Nation soothing-syrup.So said Judge Whipple,\nwith a grunt of contempt, to Mr.Cluyme, who was then a prominent\nConstitutional Unionist.Other and most estimable gentlemen were also\nConstitutional Unionists, notably Mr.Far be it from\nany one to cast disrespect upon the reputable members of this party,\nwhose broad wings sheltered likewise so many weak brethren.One Sunday evening in May, the Judge was taking tea with Mrs.The occasion was memorable for more than one event--which was that he\naddressed Stephen by his first name for the first time."You\'re an admirer of Abraham Lincoln," he had said.Whipple\'s ways, smiled quietly at his mother.He had never dared mention to the Judge his suspicions concerning his\njourney to Springfield and Freeport."Stephen," said the Judge (here the surprise came in), "Stephen, what do\nyou think of Mr."We hear of no name but Seward\'s, sir," said Stephen, When he had\nrecovered."Do you think that Lincoln would make a good President?""I have thought so, sir, ever since you were good enough to give me the\nopportunity of knowing him."It was a bold speech--the Judge drew his great eyebrows together, but he\nspoke to Mrs."I\'m not as strong as I was once, ma\'am," said he."And yet I am going\nto that Chicago convention."Brice remonstrated mildly, to the effect that he had done his share\nof political work."I shall take a younger man with me, in case anything happens.In fact,\nma\'am, I had thought of taking your son, if you can spare him."And so it was that Stephen went to that most dramatic of political\ngatherings,--in the historic Wigwam.It was so that his eyes were\nopened to the view of the monster which maims the vitality of the\nRepublic,--the political machine.Seward had brought his machine\nfrom New York,--a legion prepared to fill the Wigwam with their bodies,\nand to drown with their cries all names save that of their master.Through the kindness of Judge\nWhipple he heard many quiet talks between that gentleman and delegates\nfrom other states--Pennsylvania and Illinois and Indiana and elsewhere.He perceived that the Judge was no nonentity in this new party.Whipple sat in his own room, and the delegates came and ranged\nthemselves along the bed.Late one night, when the delegates were gone,\nStephen ventured to speak what was in his mind.Lincoln did not strike me as the kind of man, sir; who would permit\na bargain."Lincoln\'s at home playing barn-ball," said the Judge, curtly."Then," said Stephen, rather hotly, "I think you are unfair to him.""Stephen, I hope that politics may be a little cleaner when you become\na delegate," he answered, with just the suspicion of a smile."Supposing\nyou are convinced that Abraham Lincoln is the only man who can save the\nUnion, and supposing that the one way to get him nominated is to meet\nSeward\'s gang with their own methods, what would you do, sir?I want\na practical proposition, sir," said Mr.Whipple, "one that we can use\nto-night.As Stephen was silent, the Judge advised him to go to bed.Seward\'s henchmen, confident and uproarious, were\nparading the streets of Chicago with their bands and their bunting, the\nvast Wigwam was quietly filling up with bony Westerners whose ally was\nnone other than the state of Pennsylvania.These gentlemen possessed\nwind which they had not wasted in processions.And the Lord delivered\nSeward and all that was his into their hands.Seward\'s hope went out after the first ballot,\nand how some of the gentlemen attached to his person wept; and how the\nvoices shook the Wigwam, and the thunder of the guns rolled over the\ntossing water of the lake, many now living remember.That day a name was\ndelivered to the world through the mouths political schemers which was\ndestined to enter history that of the saviour of the Nation.Down in little Springfield, on a vacant lot near the station, a tall\nman in his shirt sleeves was playing barn-ball with some boys.The game\nfinished, he had put on his black coat and was starting homeward under\nthe tree--when a fleet youngster darted after him with a telegram.The\ntall man read it, and continued on his walk his head bent and his feet\ntaking long strides, Later in the day he was met by a friend."Abe," said the friend, "I\'m almighty glad there somebody in this town\'s\ngot notorious at last."In the early morning of their return from Chicago Judge Whipple\nand Stephen were standing in the front of a ferry-boat crossing the\nMississippi.The Judge had taken off his hat,\nand his gray hair was stirred by the river breeze.Illness had set\na yellow seal on the face, but the younger man remarked it not.For\nStephen, staring at the black blur of the city outline, was filled\nwith a strange exaltation which might have belonged to his Puritan\nforefathers.Now at length was come his chance to be of use in life,--to\ndedicate the labor of his hands and of his brains to Abraham Lincoln\nuncouth prophet of the West.With all his might he would work to save\nthe city for the man who was the hope of the Union.The great paddles scattered the brow waters with white\nfoam, and the Judge voiced his thoughts."Stephen," said he, "I guess we\'ll have to put on shoulders to the wheel\nthis summer.If Lincoln is not elected I have lived my sixty-five years\nfor nothing."As he descended the plank, he laid a hand on Stephen\'s arm, and\ntottered.The big Louisiana, Captain Brent\'s boat, just in from New\nOrleans, was blowing off her steam as with slow steps they climbed the\nlevee and the steep pitch of the street beyond it.The clatter of hooves\nand the crack of whips reached their ears, and, like many others before\nthem and since, they stepped into Carvel & Company\'s.On the inside of\nthe glass partition of the private office, a voice of great suavity was\nheard.It was Eliphalet Hopper\'s."If you will give me the numbers of the bales, Captain Brent, I\'ll send\na dray down to your boat and get them.""No, sir, I prefer to do business with my friend, Colonel Carvel."I could sell the goods to Texas buyers who are here in the store right\nnow.""Until I get instructions from one of the concern," vowed Captain Lige,\n"I shall do as I always have done, sir.The Captain\'s fist was heard to come down on the desk."You don\'t manage me," he said, "and I reckon you don\'t manage the\nColonel."Hopper\'s face was not pleasant to see as he emerged.But at sight of\nJudge Whipple on the steps his suavity returned."The Colonel will be in any minute, sir," said he.But the Judge walked past him without reply, and into the office.Captain Brent, seeing him; sprang to his feet."Well, well, Judge," said he, heartily, "you fellows have done it now,\nsure.I\'ll say this for you, you\'ve picked a smart man.""Better vote for him, Lige," said the Judge, setting down."A man\'s got a lot of choice this year;" said he."Two governments,\nthirty-three governments, one government patched up for a year ox two.""Lige, you\'re not such a fool as\nto vote against the Union?""Judge," said the Captain, instantly, "I\'m not the only one in this town\nwho will have to decide whether my sympathies are wrong."It\'s not a question of sympathy, Captain," answered the Judge, dryly."Abraham Lincoln himself was born in Kentucky."If Abraham Lincoln is elected, the South\nleaves this Union."The speaker was Colonel Carvel\nhimself.Whipple cried hotly, "then you will be chastised\nand brought back.For at last we have chosen a man who is strong\nenough,--who does not fear your fire-eaters,--whose electors depend on\nNorthern votes alone."Stephen rose apprehensively, So did Captain Lige The Colonel had taken a\nstep forward, and a fire was quick to kindle in his gray eyes.Judge Whipple, deathly pale, staggered and fell into\nStephen\' arms.But it was the Colonel who laid him on the horsehair\nsofa.Nor could the two who listened sound the depth of the pathos the Colonel\nput into those two words.And the brusqueness in his weakened voice\nwas even more pathetic-- "Tut, tut," said he."A little heat, and no\nbreakfast."The Colonel already had a bottle of the famous Bourbon day his hand,\nand Captain Lige brought a glass of muddy iced water.Carvel made an\ninjudicious mixture of the two, and held it to the lips of his friend.cried the Judge, and with this effort he slipped back again.Those\nwho stood there thought that the stamp of death was already on Judge\nWhipple\'s face.But the lips were firmly closed, bidding defiance, as ever, to the\nworld.The Colonel, stroking his goatee, regarded him curiously."Silas," he said slowly, "if you won\'t drink it for me, perhaps you will\ndrink it--for--Abraham--Lincoln."The two who watched that scene have never forgotten it.Outside, in the\ngreat cool store, the rattle of the trucks was heard, and Mr.The straight figure of the Colonel\ntowered above the sofa while he waited.Once Judge\nWhipple\'s bony hand opened and shut, and once his features worked.Then,\nwithout warning, he sat up."Colonel," said he, "I reckon I wouldn\'t be much use to Abe if I took\nthat.But if you\'ll send Ephum after, cup of coffee--"\n\nMr.In two strides he had reached the door\nand given the order.Then he came hack and seated himself on the sofa.He had forgotten the convention\nHe told her what had happened at Mr.Carvel\'s store, and how the Colonel\nhad tried to persuade Judge Whipple to take the Glencoe house while he\nwas in Europe, and how the Judge had refused.Tears were in the widow\'s\neyes when Stephen finished."And he means to stay here in the heat and go through, the campaign?""It will kill him, Stephen," Mrs.And he said that he would die willingly--after\nAbraham Lincoln was elected.He had nothing to live for but to fight for\nthat.He had never understood the world, and had quarrelled with at all\nhis life."He didn\'t dare to look at his mother, nor she at him.And when he\nreached the office, half an hour later, Mr.Whipple was seated in his\nchair, defiant and unapproachable.Stephen sighed as he settled down to\nhis work.The thought of one who might have accomplished what her father\ncould not was in his head.Brinsmade\'s buggy drew up at Mrs.The Brinsmade family had been for some time in the country.And\nfrequently, when that gentleman was detained in town by business, he\nwould stop at the little home for tea.The secret of the good man\'s\nvisit came out as he sat with them on the front steps afterward."I fear that it will be a hot summer, ma\'am," he had said to Mrs."The heat agrees with me remarkably, Mr.Brinsmade," said the lady,\nsmiling."I have heard that Colonel Carvel wishes to rent his house at Glencoe,"\nMr.Brinsmade continued, "The figure is not high.""It struck me that a change of air would do you\ngood, Mrs.Knowing that you shared in our uneasiness\nconcerning Judge Whipple, I thought--"\n\nHe stopped, and looked at her.It was a hard task even for that best\nand roost tactful of gentlemen, Mr.He too had misjudged this\ncalm woman.She saw, as did Stephen,\nthe kindness behind the offer--Colonel Carvel\'s kindness and his own.The gentleman\'s benevolent face brightened:\n\n"And, my dear Madam, do not let the thought of this little house trouble\nyou.It was never my expectation to have it occupied in the summer.If\nwe could induce the Judge to go to Glencoe with you for the summer; I am\nsure it would be a relief for us all."He did not press the matter; but begged Stephen to call on him in a day\nor two, at the bank."What do you think, Stephen," asked his mother, when Mr.Brinsmade was\ngone, Stephen did not reply at once.The\nvision of that proud figure of Miss Virginia was before him, and he\nrevolted.What was kindness from Colonel Carvel and Mr.Brinsmade was\ncharity from her.He could not bear the thought of living in a house\nhaunted by her.And yet why should he let his pride and his feelings\nstand in the way of the health--perhaps of the life--of Judge Whipple?It was characteristic of his mothers strength of mind not to mention the\nsubject again that evening.But\nwhen he rose in the morning he had made up his mind.After breakfast he\nwent straight to the Colonel\'s store, and fortunately found.Carvel\nat his desk, winding up his affairs.The next morning, when the train for the East pulled out of\nIllinoistown, Miss Jinny Carvel stood on the plat form tearfully waving\ngood-by to a knot of friends.Presently she\nwent into the sleeping-car to join the Colonel, who wore a gray liners\nduster.For a long time she sat gazing at the young, corn waving on\nthe prairie, fingering the bunch of June roses on her lap.Clarence had\npicked them only a few hours ago, in the dew at Bellegarde.She saw her\ncousin standing disconsolate under the train sheds, just as she had left\nhim.She pictured him riding out the Bellefontaine Road that afternoon,\nalone.Now that the ocean was to be between them, was it love that she\nfelt for Clarence at last?Once or twice she\nhad suspected him of wishing to separate them.Her Aunt Lillian, indeed,\nhad said as much, and Virginia had silenced her.But when she had asked\nthe Colonel to take Clarence to Europe, he had refused.And yet she knew\nthat he had begged Captain Lige to go.She had seen the change in\nClarence and exulted.The very first day she had surprised him on the\nporch at Bellegarde with "Hardee\'s tactics".From a boy Clarence had\nsuddenly become a man with a Purpose,--and that was the Purpose of the\nSouth."They have dared to nominate that dirty Lincoln," he said.--"Do you\nthink that we will submit to <DW65> equality rule?"If they elect him, I will stand and fight them until my legs\nare shot from under me, and then I will shoot down the Yankees from the\nground."Virginia\'s heart had leaped within her at the words, and into her eyes\nhad flashed once more the look for which the boy had waited and hoped in\nvain.He had the carriage of a soldier, the animation and endurance\nof the thoroughbred when roused.He was of the stuff that made the\nresistance of the South the marvel of the world.And well we know,\nwhatever the sound of it, that his speech was not heroics.Nor was it\nlove for his cousin that inspired it, save in this: he had apotheosized\nVirginia.To him she was the inspired goddess of the South--his country.His admiration and affection had of late been laid upon an altar.Her\nambition for him he felt was likewise the South\'s ambition for him.His mother, Virginia\'s aunt, felt this too, and strove against it with\nher feeble might.She never had had power over her son; nor over any\nman, save the temporal power of beauty.And to her mortification she\nfound herself actually in fear of this girl who might have been her\ndaughter.So in Virginia\'s presence she became more trivial and petty\nthan ever.It had of course been a foregone conclusion that Clarence should join\nCompany A. Few young men of family did not.And now he ran to his room\nto don for Virginia that glorious but useless full dress,--the high\nbearskin rat, the red pigeon-tailed coat, the light blue trousers, and\nthe gorgeous, priceless shackle.He\nheld his big rifle like a veteran, and his face was set with a high\nresolve there was no mistaking.The high color of her pride was on the\ncheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her, his\nmistress.And yet, when he was gone, and she sat alone amid the roses\nawaiting him, came wilfully before her another face that was relentless\ndetermination,--the face of Stephen Brice, as he had stood before her\nin the summer house at Glencoe.Strive as she might against the thought,\ndeny it to herself and others, to Virginia Carvel his way become the\nface of the North.Her patriotism and all that was in her of race\nrebelled.To conquer that face she would have given her own soul, and\nClarence\'s.Angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks, and cried\nout aloud that it was not inflexible.And now, by the car window, looking out over the endless roll of the\nprairie, the memory of this was bitter within her."Did you rent our house at Glencoe?"Brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent,\neven to save Mr.The Colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise.She was leaning\nback on the seat, her eyes half closed."Once you dislike a person, Jinny, you never get over it.I always had\na fancy for the young man, and now I have a better opinion of him than\never before.It was I who insulted them by naming that rent."\'Colonel Carvel,\' said he,\n\'I hear you wish to rent your house.\'\'You rented it once\nbefore, sir,\' said he.\'May I ask you what price you got\nfor it?\'"I told him," said the Colonel, smiling."But I explained that I could\nnot expect to command that price now on short notice.He replied that\nthey would pay it, or not consider the place."Virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields.Brinsmade tells me that young Brice won rather a remarkable case\nlast winter, and since then has had some practice.I believe he declined some sort of an editorial\nposition, preferring to remain at the law.""And so they are going into the house?""Whipple refused point-blank to go to the\ncountry.He said that he would be shirking the only work of his life\nlikely to be worth anything.CHAPTER X. RICHTER\'S SCAR\n\nThis was the summer when Mr.Stephen Brice began to make his appearance\nin public.The very first was rather encouraging than otherwise,\nalthough they were not all so.It was at a little town on the outskirts\nof the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to\nlisten.In writing that speech Stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of\nadvice which Mr."Speak so that the lowest may\nunderstand, and the rest will have no trouble."At\nthe halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately\nwide of the mark.After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his\naudience,--especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in\nthe rear, out of sight of the stand.This may have been Judge Whipple,\nalthough we have no proof of the fact.Stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech.He\nlaughs now when it is spoken of, and calls it a boyish effort, which it\nwas.I have no doubt that many of the master\'s phrases slipped in, as\nyoung Mr.Brice could repeat most of the Debates, and the Cooper Union\nspeech by heart.He had caught more than the phrasing, however.So\nimbued was he with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln that his hearers caught\nit; and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages.The event\nis to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to\nask questions.For one thing, he had not mentioned abolition.Wasn\'t it\ntrue, then, that this Lincoln wished to tear the <DW64> from his master,\ngive him a vote and a subsidy, and set him up as the equal of the man\nthat owned him?"Slavery may stay where it is," cried the young orator."If it is content there, so are we content.What we say is that it shall\nnot go one step farther.No, not one inch into a northern territory."Brice was one of the orators at a much larger\nmeeting in a garden in South St.And this was even a happier event, inasmuch as Mr.Brice was able to\ntrace with some skill the history of the Fatherland from the Napoleonic\nwars to its Revolution.Incidentally he told them why they had emigrated\nto this great and free country.And when in an inspired moment he\ncoupled the names of Abraham Lincoln and Father Jahn, the very leaves of\nthe trees above them trembled at their cheers.And afterwards there was a long-remembered supper in the moonlit grove\nwith Richter and a party of his college friends from Jena.There was\nHerr Tiefel with the little Dresden-blue eyes, red and round and jolly;\nand Hauptmann, long and thin and sallow; and Korner, redbearded and\nponderous; and Konig, a little clean-cut man with a blond mustache\nthat pointed upward.They clattered their steins on the table and sang\nwonderful Jena songs, while Stephen was lifted up and his soul carried\noff to far-away Saxony,--to the clean little University town with\nits towers and crooked streets.And when they sang the Trolksmelodie,\n"Bemooster Bursche zieh\' ich aus,--Ade!"a big tear rolled down the scar\non Richter\'s cheek."Fahrt wohl, ihr Strassen grad and krumm\n        Ich zieh\' nicht mehr in euch herum,\n        Durchton euch nicht mehr mit Gesang,\n        Mit Larm nicht mehr and Sporenklang."As the deep tones died away, the soft night was steeped in the sadness\nof that farewell song.It was Richter who brought the full force of it\nhome to Stephen."Do you recall the day you left your Harvard, and your Boston, my\nfriend?"He had never spoken of the bitterness of that, even\nto his mother.And here was the difference between the Saxon and the\nAnglo-Saxon.Richter smoked his pipe\'mid dreamy silence, the tear still wet upon his\nface."Tiefel and I were at the University together," he said at length."He\nremembers the day I left Jena for good and all.Ah, Stephen, that is\nthe most pathetic thing in life, next to leaving the Fatherland.We\ndine with our student club for the last time at the Burg Keller, a dingy\nlittle tavern under a grim old house, but very dear to us.We swear for\nthe last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic, and to die for\nthe Fatherland, if God so wills.And then we march at the head of a slow\nprocession out of the old West Gate, two and two, old members first,\nthen the fox major and the foxes.""The youngsters--the freshmen, you call them," answered Richter,\nsmiling."And after the foxes," said Herr Tiefel, taking up the story, "after the\nfoxes comes the empty carriage, with its gay postilion and four.And so we go\nslowly until we; come to the Oil Mill Tavern, where we have had many\na schlager-bout with the aristocrats.And the president of our society\nmakes his farewell speech under the vines, and we drink to you with all\nthe honors.And we drank to you, Carl, renowned swordsman!"And Herr\nTiefel, carried away by the recollection, rose to his feet.The others caught fire, and stood up with their mugs high in the air,\nshouting:\n\n"Lebe wohl, Carl!Salamander, salamander, salamander!Ein ist\nein, zwei ist zwei, drei ist drei!And so they toasted every man present, even Stephen himself, whom they\ncomplimented on his speech.And he soon learned to cry Salamander,\nand to rub his mug on the table, German fashion.He was not long in\ndiscovering that Richter was not merely a prime favorite with his\ncompanions, but likewise a person of some political importance in South\nSt.In the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom\nStephen recognized as one of the German leaders (he afterwards became a\nUnited States general) came and stood smiling by the table and joined in\nthe singing.But presently he carried Richter away with him."What a patriot he would have made, had our country been spared to us!""I think he was the best man with the Schlager\nthat Jena ever saw.Even Korner likes not to stand against him in mask\nand fencing hat, all padded.Herr Korner gave a good-natured growl of assent."I have still a welt that he gave me a month since," he said."He has\nleft his mark on many an aristocrat.""And why did you always fight the aristocrats?"They all tried to tell him at once, but Tiefel prevailed."Because they were for making our country Austrian, my friend," he\ncried."Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor.Because the\nmost of them were immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be\nby morality and pure living that our \'Vaterland\' was to be rescued.And\nso we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs.We swore to live by the\nstandards of the great Jahn, of whom you spoke.We swore to strive for\nthe freedom of Germany with manly courage.And when we were not duelling\nwith the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves.""Ja wohl," answered Korner, puffing heavily.The slit in his nose was\nplain even in the moonlight."To keep our hands in, as you would say.You Americans are a brave people--without the Schlager.But we fought\nthat we might not become effete."It was then that Stephen ventured to ask a question that, had been long\nburning within him.Korner," said he, "how did Richter come by that scar?He\nalways gets red when I mention it."Ah, I can well believe that," answered Korner."I will recount that\nmatter,--if you do not tell Carl, lieber Freund.Brice," Herr Korner continued, "has never heard of the Count von\nKalbach.We at Jena had, and all Germany.Many of us of\nthe Burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his Schlager.Von\nKalbach went to Bonn, that university of the aristocrats, where he was\nworshipped.When he came to Berlin with his sister, crowds would gather\nto look at them.exclaimed\nHerr Korner, "there is something in blood, when all is said.He was as\nstraight and strong as an oak of the Black Forest, and she as fair as a\npoplar.It is so with the Pomeranians."It was in the year \'47, when Carl Richter was gone home to Berlin\nbefore his last semester, to see his father: One fine morning von\nKalbach rode in at the Brandenburg gate on a great black stallion.He\nboasted openly that day that none of the despised \'Burschenschaft\' dare\nstand before him.Before night\nall Berlin had heard of the temerity of the young Liberal of the Jena\n\'Burschenschaft\'.To our shame be it said, we who knew and loved Carl\nlikewise feared for him."Carl chose for his second Ebhardt, a man of our own Germanian Club at\nJena, since killed in the Breite Strasse.And if you will believe me,\nmy friend.I tell you that Richter came to the glade at daybreak\nsmoking his pipe.The place was filled, the nobles on one side and\nthe Burschenschaft on the other, and the sun coming up over the trees.Richter would not listen to any of us, not even the surgeon.He would\nnot have the silk wound on his arm, nor the padded breeches, nor the\nneck covering--Nothing!So Ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap,\nand his apron with the device of the Germanians."There stood the Count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue.And\nwhen it was seen that Richter likewise had no protection, but was calmly\nsmoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon\nall.At the sight of the pipe von Kalbach ground his heel in the turf,\nand when the word was given he rushed at Richter like a wild beast.You,\nmy friend, who have never heard the whistle of sharp Schlager cannot\nknow the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade.It was music\nthat morning: You should have seen the noble\'s mighty strokes--\'Prim und\nSecond und Terz und Quart\'.You would have marked how Richter met him\nat every blow.Von Kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke\nfrom the bowl.He was terrible in his fury, and I shiver now to think\nhow we of the Burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was\ndriven back a step, and then another.You must know that it is a lasting\ndisgrace to be forced over one\'s own line.It seemed as if we could not\nbear the agony.And then, while we counted out the last seconds of the\nhalf, came a snap like that of a whip\'s lash, and the bowl of Richter\'s\npipe lay smouldering on the grass.The noble had cut the stem as clean\nas it were sapling twig, and there stood Richter with the piece still\nclenched in his teeth, his eyes ablaze, and his cheek running blood.He\npushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles.The Count\nwas smiling as he put up his sword, his friends crowding around\nhim, when Ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second\nmensur,--though the wound was three needles long.Then Kalbach cried\naloud that he would kill him.Something\nwas in them that made us think as we washed the cut.But when we spoke\nto him he said nothing.Nor could we force the pipe stems from his\nteeth.exclaimed Herr Korner, but reverently, "if I live to a\nhundred I never hope to see such a sight as that \'Mensur\'.The Schlager flew so fast that we only saw the light and heard\nthe ring alone.Before we of the Burschenschaft knew what had happened\nthe Count von Kalbach was over his line and had flung his Schlager into\na great tree, and was striding from the place with his head hung and the\ntears streamin down his face."Amid a silence, Herr Korner lifted his great mug and emptied it slowly.A wind was rising, bearing with it song and laughter from distant\ngroups,--Teutonic song and, laughter.The moonlight trembled through the\nshifting leaves.And Stephen was filled with a sense of the marvelous.It was as if this fierce duel, so full of national significance to a\nGerman, had been fought in another existence, It was incredible to him\nthat the unassuming lawyer he knew, so wholly Americanized, had been the\nhero of it.Strange, indeed, that the striving life of these leaders of\nEuropean Revolution had been suddenly cut off in its vigor.There\ncame to Stephen a flash of that world-comprehension which marks great\nstatesmen.Was it not with a divine purpose that this measureless force\nof patriotism and high ideal had been given to this youngest of the\nnations, that its high mission might be fulfilled?She and her brothers and Jack\nBrinsmade used to banter him when he came a-visiting in Bellefontaine\nRoad.The time was not yet come when neighbor stared coldly upon\nneighbor, when friends of long standing passed each other with averted\nlooks.It was not even a wild dream that white-trash Lincoln would be\nelected.Jack, who made speeches for Breckenridge in the face\nof Mr.Brinsmade\'s Union leanings, laughed at Stephen when he came to\nspend the night.He joined forces with Puss in making clever fun of the\nbooby Dutch, which Stephen was wise enough to take good-naturedly.But\nonce or twice when he met Clarence Colfax at these houses he was aware\nof a decided change in the attitude of that young gentleman.This\ntroubled him more than he cared to admit.For he liked Clarence, who\nreminded him of Virginia--at once a pleasure and a pain.It is no harm to admit (for the benefit of the Society for Psychical\nResearch) that Stephen still dreamed of her.He would go about his work\nabsently all the morning with the dream still in his head, and the girl\nso vividly near him that he could not believe her to be travelling in\nEngland, as Miss Russell said.Puss and Anne were careful to keep him\ninformed as to her whereabouts.Stephen set this down as a most natural\nsupposition on their part that all young men must have an interest in\nVirginia Carvel.How needless to add that Virginia in her correspondence never mentioned\nStephen, although Puss in her letters took pains to record the fact\nevery time that he addressed a Black Republican meeting: Miss Carvel\npaid no attention to this part of the communications.Her concern for\nJudge Whipple Virginia did not hide.How he stood the\nrigors of that campaign were a mystery to friend and foe alike.HOW A PRINCE CAME\n\nWho has not heard of the St.And what memories\nof its October days the mere mention of at brings back to us who knew\nthat hallowed place as children.There was the vast wooden amphitheatre\nwhere mad trotting races were run; where stolid cattle walked past the\nChinese pagoda in the middle circle, and shook the blue ribbons on their\nhorns.But it was underneath the tiers of seats (the whole way around\nthe ring) that the chief attractions lay hid.These were the church\nbooths, where fried oysters and sandwiches and cake and whit candy and\nice-cream were sold by your mothers and sister for charity.These ladies\nwore white aprons as they waited on the burly farmers.And toward the\nclose of the day for which they had volunteered they became distracted.Thayer\'s,\nUnitarian, where Mrs.Davitt\'s, conducted\nby Mr.Eliphalet Hopper on strictly business principles, and the Roman\nCatholic Cathedral, where Miss Renault and other young ladies of French\ndescent presided: and Dr.Posthelwaite\'s, Presbyterian, which we shall\ncome to presently.And others, the whole way around the ring.Louisans still delight to recall,--that\nof the autumn of 1860--Think for a minute.You will remember that\nVirginia Carvel came back from Europe; and made quite a stir in a\ntown where all who were worth knowing were intimates.Stephen caught a\nglimpse of her an the street, received a distant bow, and dreamed of her\nthat night.Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday suit, was at the ferry\nto pay his respects to the Colonel, to offer his services, and to\ntell him how the business fared.Louis face that\nVirginia saw (Captain Lige being in New Orleans), and if she conversed\nwith Eliphalet on the ferry with more warmth than ever before, there is\nnothing strange in that.Hopper rode home with them in the carriage,\nand walked to Miss Crane\'s with his heart thumping against his breast,\nand wild thoughts whirling in his head.The next morning, in Virginia\'s sunny front room tears and laughter\nmingled.There was a present for Eugenie and Anne and Emily and Puss\nand Maude, and a hear kiss from the Colonel for each.And more tears\nand laughter and sighs as Mammy Easter and Rosetta unpacked the English\ntrunks, and with trembling hands and rolling eyes laid each Parisian\ngown upon the bed.At the thought of that glorious year my pen fails me.Why mention the\ndread possibility of the <DW64>-worshiper Lincoln being elected the\nvery next month?Why listen, to the rumblings in the South?Pompeii had\nchariot-races to the mutterings of Vesuvius.Louis was in gala garb\nto greet a Prince.That was the year that Miss Virginia Carvel was given charge of the\nbooth in Dr.Posthelwaite\'s church,--the booth next one of the great\narches through which prancing horses and lowing cattle came.Now who do you think stopped at the booth for a chat with Miss Jinny?Who made her blush as pink as her Paris gown?Who slipped into her hand\nthe contribution for the church, and refused to take the cream candy she\nlaughingly offered him as an equivalent?None other than Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Duke of Saxony, Duke of\nCornwall and Rothesay, Earl of Chester and Carrick, Baron Renfrew, and\nLord of the Isles.Out of compliment to the Republic which he visited,\nhe bore the simple title of Lord Renfrew.Bitter tears of envy, so it was said, were shed in the other booths.Belle Cluyme made a remark which is best suppressed.Eliphalet Hopper,\nin Mr.Davitt\'s booths, stared until his eyes watered.A great throng\npeered into the covered way, kept clear for his Royal Highness and\nsuite, and for the prominent gentlemen who accompanied them.And when\nthe Prince was seen to turn to His Grace, the Duke of Newcastle, and the\nsubscription was forthcoming, a great cheer shook the building, while\nVirginia and the young ladies with her bowed and blushed and smiled.Colonel Carvel, who was a Director, laid his hand paternally on the\nblue coat of the young Prince.Reversing all precedent, he presented\nhis Royal Highness to his daughter and to the other young ladies.It was\ndone with the easy grace of a Southern gentleman.Whereupon Lord Renfrew\nbowed and smiled too, and stroked his mustache, which was a habit he\nhad, and so fell naturally into the ways of Democracy.Miss Puss Russell, who has another name, and whose hair is now white,\nwill tell you how Virginia carried off the occasion with credit to her\ncountry.It is safe to say that the Prince forgot "Silver Heels" and "Royal Oak,"\nalthough they had been trotted past the Pagoda only that morning for his\ndelectation.He had forgotten his Honor the Mayor, who had held fast to\nthe young man\'s arm as the four coal-black horses had pranced through\nthe crowds all the way from Barnum\'s Hotel to the Fair Grounds.His\nRoyal Highness forgot himself still further, and had at length withdrawn\nhis hands from the pockets of his ample pantaloons and thrust his thumbs\ninto his yellow waistcoat.And who shall blame him if Miss Virginia\'s\nreplies to his sallies enchained him?Not the least impressive of those who stood by, smiling, was the figure\nof the tall Colonel, his hat off for once, and pride written on his\nface.Oh, that his dear wife might have lived to see this!What was said in that historic interview with a future Sovereign of\nEngland, far from his royal palaces, on Democratic sawdust, with an\nAmerican Beauty across a board counter, was immediately recorded by the\nColonel, together with an exact description of his Royal Highness\'s blue\ncoat, and light, flowing pantaloons, and yellow waist-coat, and \nkids; even the Prince\'s habit of stroking his mustache did not escape\nthe watchful eye.It is said that his Grace of Newcastle smiled twice at\nMiss Virginia\'s retorts, and Lord Lyons, the British Minister, has more\nthan two to his credit.Miss\nVirginia in the very midst of a sentence paused, and then stopped.Her\neyes had strayed from the Royal Countenance, and were fixed upon a\npoint in the row of heads outside the promenade.Her sentence was\ncompleted--with some confusion.Perhaps it is no wonder that my Lord\nRenfrew, whose intuitions are quick, remarked that he had already\nremained too long, thus depriving the booth of the custom it otherwise\nshould have had.This was a graceful speech, and a kingly.Followed by\nhis retinue and the prominent citizens, he moved on.And it was remarked\nby keen observers that his Honor the Mayor had taken hold once more of\nthe Prince\'s elbow, who divided his talk with Colonel Carver.What a true American of the old type you were.You,\nnor the Mayor, nor the rest of the grave and elderly gentlemen were not\nblinded by the light of a royal Presence.You saw in him only an amiable\nand lovable young man, who was to succeed the most virtuous and lovable\nof sovereigns, Victoria.You, Colonel Carvel, were not one to cringe to\nroyalty.Out of respect for the just and lenient Sovereign, his mother,\nyou did honor to the Prince.But you did not remind him, as you might\nhave, that your ancestors fought for the King at Marston Moor, and that\nyour grandfather was once an intimate of Charles James Fox.Cluyme, and of a few others whose wealth alone\nenabled them to be Directors of the Fair?Miss Isabel Cluyme was duly\npresented, in proper form, to his Royal Highness.Her father owned a\n"peerage," and had been abroad likewise.He made no such bull as the\nColonel.And while the celebrated conversation of which we have spoken\nwas in progress, Mr.Cluyme stood back and blushed for his countryman,\nand smiled apologetically at the few gentlemen of the royal suite who\nglanced his way.His Royal Highness then proceeded to luncheon, which is described by a\nmost amiable Canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account\nof it that I cannot forbear to copy.You may believe what he says, or\nnot, just as you choose: "So interested was his Royal Highness in the\nproceedings that he stayed in the ring three and a half hours witnessing\nthese trotting matches.He was invited to take lunch in a little wooden\nshanty prepared for the Directors, to which he accordingly repaired, but\nwhether he got anything to eat or not, I cannot tell.After much trouble\nhe forced his way to the table, which he found surrounded by a lot of\nravenous animals.And upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices\nof beef, mutton, and buffalo tongue; beside them were great jugs of\nlager beer, rolls of bread, and plates of a sort of cabbage cut into\nthin shreds, raw, and mixed with vinegar.There were neither salt spoons\nnor mustard spoons, the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in\ntheir stead; and, by the aid of nature\'s forks, the slices of beef and\nmutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat.While\nyour correspondent stood looking at the spectacle, the Duke of Newcastle\ncame in, and he sat looking too.He was evidently trying to look\ndemocratic, but could not manage it.By his side stood a man urging him\nto try the lager beer, and cabbage also, I suppose.Henceforth, let the\nNew York Aldermen who gave to the Turkish Ambassador ham sandwiches and\nbad sherry rest in peace."Even that great man whose memory we love and revere, Charles Dickens,\nwas not overkind to us, and saw our faults rather than our virtues.We\nwere a nation of grasshoppers, and spat tobacco from early morning until\nlate at night.This some of us undoubtedly did, to our shame be it\nsaid.Dickens went down the Ohio, early in the \'40\'s, he\ncomplained of the men and women he met; who, bent with care, bolted\nthrough silent meals, and retired within their cabins.Dickens\nsaw our ancestors bowed in a task that had been too great for other\nblood,--the task of bringing into civilization in the compass of a\ncentury a wilderness three thousand miles it breadth.And when his Royal\nHighness came to St.Louis and beheld one hundred thousand people at the\nFair, we are sure that he knew how recently the ground he stood upon had\nbeen conquered from the forest.For, while the Prince lingered\nin front of the booth of Dr.Posthelwaite\'s church and chatted with\nVirginia, a crowd had gathered without.They stood peering over the\nbarricade into the covered way, proud of the self-possession of their\nyoung countrywoman.And here, by a twist of fate, Mr.Stephen Brice\nfound himself perched on a barrel beside his friend Richter.It was\nRichter who discovered her first.It is Miss Carvel herself, Stephen," he cried, impatient at the\nimpassive face of his companion."Yes," said Stephen, "I see."exclaimed the disgusted German, "will nothing move you?I have\nseen German princesses that are peasant women beside her.Stephen saw, and horror held him in a tremor.What if she should raise her eyes, and amid those vulgar stares\ndiscern his own?And yet that was within him which told him that she\nwould look up.It was only a question of moments, and then,--and then\nshe would in truth despise him!Wedged tightly between the people, to\nmove was to be betrayed.Suddenly he rallied, ashamed of his own false shame.This was because\nof one whom he had known for the short, space of a day--whom he was\nto remember for a lifetime.The man he worshipped, and she detested.Abraham Lincoln would not have blushed between honest clerks and farmers\nWhy should Stephen Brice?And what, after all, was this girl to him?Almost the first day he had come to St.Louis the wires\nof their lives had crossed, and since then had crossed many times again,\nalways with a spark.By the might of generations she was one thing, and\nhe another.They were separated by a vast and ever-widening breach only\nto be closed by the blood and bodies of a million of their countrymen.Gradually, charmed like the simple people about him, Stephen became lost\nin the fascination of the scene.Suddenly confronted at a booth in a\npublic fair with the heir to the English throne, who but one of her own\nkind might have carried it off so well, have been so complete a mistress\nof herself?Since, save for a heightened color, Virginia gave no sign of\nexcitement.Undismayed, forgetful of the admiring crowd, unconscious of\ntheir stares until--until the very strength of his gaze had compelled\nher own.Nor did he wonder\nbecause, in that multitude of faces, her eyes had flown so straightly\nhomeward to his.With a rough effort that made an angry stir, Stephen flung the people\naside and escaped, the astonished Richter following in his wake.Nor\ncould the honest German dissuade him from going back to the office for\nthe rest of the day, or discover what had happened.But all through the afternoon that scene was painted on the pages of\nStephen\'s books.The free pose\nof the girl standing in front of her companions, a blue wisp of autumn\nsunlight falling at her feet.The young Prince laughing at her sallies,\nand the elderly gentleman smiling with benevolence upon the pair.INTO WHICH A POTENTATE COMES\n\nVirginia danced with the Prince, "by Special Appointment," at the ball\nthat evening.So likewise was Miss\nBelle Cluyme among those honored and approved.But Virginia wore the\nmost beautiful of her Paris gowns, and seemed a princess to one watching\nfrom the gallery.Stephen was sure that his Royal Highness made that\nparticular dance longer than the others.It was decidedly longer than\nthe one he had with Miss Cluyme, although that young lady had declared\nshe was in heaven.Alas, that princes cannot abide with us forever!His Royal Highness bade\nfarewell to St.Louis, and presently that same \'City of Alton\' which\nbore him northward came back again in like royal state, and this time it\nwas in honor of a Democrat potentate.He is an old friend now, Senator\nand Judge and Presidential Candidate,--Stephen Arnold Douglas,--father\nof the doctrine of Local Sovereignty, which he has come to preach.We are no sooner rid of one hero than we are ready for\nanother.Blow, you bandsmen on the hurricane deck, let the shores echo with your\nnational airs!Let the gay bunting wave in the river breeze!Uniforms\nflash upon the guards, for no campaign is complete without the military.Here are brave companies of the Douglas Guards, the Hickory Sprouts, and\nthe Little Giants to do honor to the person of their hero.Cannon are\nbooming as he steps into his open carriage that evening on the levee,\nwhere the piles of river freight are covered with people.Transparencies\nare dodging in the darkness.A fresh band strikes up "Hail Columbia,"\nand the four horses prance away, followed closely by the "Independent\nBroom Rangers.""The shouts for Douglas," remarked a keen observer who\nwas present, "must have penetrated Abraham\'s bosom at Springfield."Jacob Cluyme, who had been a Bell and Everett man until that day,\nwas not the only person of prominence converted.After the speech he\nassured the Judge that he was now undergoing the greatest pleasure of\nhis life in meeting the popular orator, the true representative man of\nthe Great West, the matured statesman, and the able advocate of national\nprinciples.Douglas looked as if he had heard something\nof the kind before, he pressed Mr.So was the author of Popular Sovereignty, "the great Bulwark of American\nIndependence," escorted to the Court House steps, past houses of his\nstanch supporters; which were illuminated in his honor.Stephen,\nwedged among the people, remarked that the Judge had lost none of his\nself-confidence since that day at Freeport.Who, seeing the Democratic\ncandidate smiling and bowing to the audience that blocked the wide\nsquare, would guess that the Question troubled him at all, or that he\nmissed the votes of the solid South?How gravely the Judge listened to\nthe eulogy of the prominent citizen, who reminded him that his work was\nnot yet finished, and that he still was harnessed to the cause of the\npeople!And how happy was the choice of that word harnessed!The Judge had heard (so he said) with deep emotion the remarks of the\nchairman.Then followed one of those masterful speeches which wove a\nspell about those who listened,--which, like the most popular of novels,\nmoved to laughter and to tears, to anger and to pity.Brice and\nMr Richter were not the only Black Republicans who were depressed that\nnight.And they trudged homeward with the wild enthusiasm still ringing\nin their ears, heavy with the thought that the long, hot campaign of\ntheir own Wide-Awakes might be in vain.They had a grim reproof from Judge Whipple in the morning."So you too, gentlemen, took opium last night," was all he said.Lincoln\'s election did not interfere with\nthe gayeties.Clarence Colfax gave a great\ndance at Bellegarde, in honor of his cousin, Virginia, to which Mr.Virginia would have liked to have had them in uniform.It was at this time that Anne Brinsmade took the notion of having a ball\nin costume.Virginia, on hearing the news, rode over from Bellegarde,\nand flinging her reins to Nicodemus ran up to Anne\'s little\ndressing-room.Anne ran over the long list of their acquaintance, but there was one\nname she omitted.asked Virginia, searchingly, when she\nhad finished."I have invited Stephen Brice, Jinny," she said.Am I to be confronted with that\nYankee everywhere I go?It is always \'Stephen Brice\', and he is ushered\nin with a but."She had dignity, however, and\nplenty of it."You have no right to criticise my guests, Virginia."Virginia, seated on the arm of a chair, tapped her foot on the floor."Why couldn\'t things remain as they were?""We were so happy\nbefore these Yankees came.And they are not content in trying to deprive\nus of our rights."Stephen Brice is a gentleman," answered Anne."He spoils no one\'s\npleasure, and goes no place that he is not asked.""He has not behaved according to my idea of a gentleman, the few\ntimes that I have been unfortunate enough to encounter him," Virginia\nretorted."You are the only one who says so, then."Here the feminine got the\nbetter of Anne\'s prudence, and she added."I saw you waltz with him\nonce, Jinny Carvel, and I am sure you never enjoyed a dance as much in\nyour life.""You may have your ball, and your Yankees,\nall of them you want.How I wish I had never seen\nthat horrid Stephen Brice!Virginia rose and snatched her riding-whip.She threw her arms around her friend without more ado."Don\'t quarrel with me, Jinny," she said tearfully.Brice is not coming, I am sure."And I was going on to\ntell you that he could not come."She stopped, and stared at Virginia in bewilderment.That young lady,\ninstead of beaming, had turned her back.She stood flicking her whip at\nthe window, gazing out over the trees, down the <DW72> to the river."Because he is to be one of the speakers at a big meeting that night.Have you seen him since you got home, Jinny?We are much worried about him, because he has worked so hard this\nsummer."exclaimed Virginia, scornfully ignoring\nthe rest of what was said."Then I\'ll come, Anne dear," she cried,\ntripping the length of the room.She cantered off down the drive and out of the gate, leaving a very\npuzzled young woman watching her from the window.But when Virginia\nreached the forest at the bend of the road, she pulled her horse down to\na walk.She bethought herself of the gown which her Uncle Daniel had sent her\nfrom Calvert House, and of the pearls.And she determined to go as her\ngreat-grandmother, Dorothy Carvel.How many readers will smile before the rest of this\ntrue incident is told?Miss Anne Brinsmade had driven to town in\nher mother\'s Jenny Lind a day or two before, and had stopped (as she\noften did) to pay a call on Mrs.This lady, as may be guessed,\nwas not given to discussion of her husband\'s ancestors, nor of her\nown.But on the walls of the little dining-room hung a Copley and two\nStuarts.One of the Stuarts was a full length of an officer in the buff\nand blue of the Continental Army.And it was this picture which caught\nAnne\'s eye that day."Colonel Wilton Brice, Stephen\'s grandfather.There is a marked\nlook about all the Brices.He was only twenty years of age when the\nRevolution began.That picture was painted much later in life, after\nStuart came back to America, when the Colonel was nearly forty.He had\nkept his uniform, and his wife persuaded him to be painted in it.""If Stephen would only come as Colonel Wilton Brice!""Do you\nthink he would, Mrs."I am afraid not, Anne," she said."I have a part of the uniform\nupstairs, but I could never induce him even to try it on."As she drove from shop to shop that day, Anne reflected that it\ncertainly would not be like Stephen to wear his grandfather\'s uniform to\na ball.But she meant to ask him, at any rate.And she had driven home\nimmediately to write her invitations.It was with keen disappointment\nthat she read his note of regret.However, on the very day of the ball, Anne chanced to be in town again,\nand caught sight of Stephen pushing his way among the people on Fourth\nStreet.She waved her hand to him, and called to Nicodemus to pull up at\nthe sidewalk."We are all so sorry that you are not coming," said she, impulsively.For Anne was a sincere person, and\nremembered Virginia."That is, I am so sorry," she added, a little\nhastily."Stephen, I saw the portrait of your grandfather, and I wanted\nyou to come in his costume."Stephen, smiling down on her, said nothing.And poor Anne, in her fear\nthat he had perceived the shade in her meaning, made another unfortunate\nremark."If you were not a--a Republican--" she said."A Black Republican," he answered, and laughed at her discomfiture."I only meant that if you were not a Republican, there would be no\nmeeting to address that night.""It does not make any difference to you what my politics are, does it?""Some people have discarded me," he said, striving to smile.She wondered whether he meant Virginia, and whether he cared.Still\nfurther embarrassed, she said something which she regretted immediately."Couldn\'t you contrive to come?""I will come, after the meeting, if it is not too late," he said at\nlength.He lifted his hat, and hurried on, leaving Anne in a quandary.Virginia was coming on\nthe condition that he was not to be there.Stephen, too, was almost instantly sorry that he had promised.The\nlittle costumer\'s shop (the only one in the city at that time) had been\nransacked for the occasion, and nothing was left to fit him.But when he\nreached home there was a strong smell of camphor in his mother\'s room.Colonel Brice\'s cocked hat and sword and spurs lay on the bed, and\npresently Hester brought in the blue coat and buff waistcoat from the\nkitchen, where she had been pressing them.Stephen must needs yield to\nhis mother\'s persuasions and try them on--they were more than a passable\nfit.But there were the breeches and cavalry boots to be thought of, and\nthe ruffled shirt and the powdered wig.So before tea he hurried down\nto the costumer\'s again, not quite sure that he was not making a fool\nof himself, and yet at last sufficiently entered into the spirit of the\nthing.The coat was mended and freshened.And when after tea he dressed\nin the character, his appearance was so striking that his mother could\nnot refrain from some little admiration.As for Hester, she was in\ntransports.But still the frivolity of\nit all troubled him.He had inherited from Colonel Wilton Brice, the\nPuritan, other things beside clothes.And he felt in his heart as he\nwalked soberly to the hall that this was no time for fancy dress balls.All intention of going was banished by the time his turn had come to\nspeak.Not caring to sit out the\nmeeting on the platform, he made his way down the side of the crowded\nhall, and ran into (of all people) big Tom Catherwood.As the Southern\nRights politics of the Catherwood family were a matter of note in the\ncity, Stephen did not attempt to conceal his astonishment.He congratulated Stephen on his speech, and\nvolunteered the news that he had come in a spirit of fairness to hear\nwhat the intelligent leaders of the Republican party, such as Judge\nWhipple, had to say.But the sight of him\nstarted in Stephen a train of thought that closed his ears for once\nto the Judge\'s words.He had had before a huge liking for Tom.Now he\nadmired him, for it was no light courage that took one of his position\nthere.And Stephen remembered that Tom was not risking merely the\ndispleasure of his family and his friends, but likewise something of\ngreater value than, either.From childhood Tom had been the devoted\nslave of Virginia Carvel, with as little chance of marrying her as a man\never had.And now he was endangering even that little alliance.And so Stephen began to think of Virginia, and to wonder what she would\nwear at Anne\'s party; and to speculate how she would have treated him if\nhad gone.To speak truth, this last matter had no little weight in his\ndecision to stay away.But we had best leave motives to those whose\nbusiness and equipment it is to weigh to a grain.Since that agonizing\nmoment when her eyes had met his own among the curiously vulgar at the\nFair, Stephen\'s fear of meeting Virginia had grown to the proportions of\na terror.And yet there she was in his mind, to take possession of it on\nthe slightest occasion.When Judge Whipple had finished, Tom rose."Stephen," said he, "of course you\'re going to the Brinsmade\'s.""Why, then, you\'ve got to come with me," says Tom, heartily."It isn\'t\ntoo late, and they\'ll want you.I\'ve a buggy, and I\'m going to the\nRussells\' to change my clothes.BRINSMADE\'S GATE\n\nThe eastern side of the Brinsmade house is almost wholly taken up by the\nbig drawing-room where Anne gave her fancy-dress ball.From the windows\nmight be seen, through the trees in the grounds, the Father of Waters\nbelow.But the room is gloomy now, that once was gay, and a heavy coat\nof soot is spread on the porch at the back, where the apple blossoms\nstill fall thinly in the spring.The huge black town has coiled about\nthe place the garden still struggles on, but the giants of the forest\nare dying and dead.Bellefontaine Road itself, once the drive of\nfashion, is no more.Trucks and cars crowd the streets which follow its\nonce rural windings, and gone forever are those comely wooded hills and\ngreen pastures,--save in the memory of those who have been spared to\ndream.Still the old house stands, begrimed but stately, rebuking the sordid\nlife around it.Still come into it the Brinsmades to marriage and to\ndeath.Calvin Brinsmade took his\nbride there.They sat on the porch in the morning light, harking to\nthe whistle of the quail in the corn, and watching the frightened deer\nscamper across the open.Do you see the bride in her high-waisted gown,\nand Mr.Calvin in his stock and his blue tail-coat and brass buttons?Old people will tell you of the royal hospitality then, of the famous\nmen and women who promenaded under those chandeliers, and sat down to\nthe game-laden table.In 1835 General Atkinson and his officers thought\nnothing of the twenty miles from Jefferson Barracks below, nor of\ndancing all night with the Louisville belles, who were Mrs.Thither came Miss Todd of Kentucky, long before she thought\nof taking for a husband that rude man of the people, Abraham Lincoln.Foreigners of distinction fell in love with the place, with its\nopen-hearted master and mistress, and wrote of it in their journals.Would that many of our countrymen, who think of the West as rough, might\nhave known the quality of the Brinsmades and their neighbors!An era of charity, of golden simplicity, was passing on that October\nnight of Anne Brinsmade\'s ball.Those who made merry there were soon\nto be driven and scattered before the winds of war; to die at Wilson\'s\nCreek, or Shiloh, or to be spared for heroes of the Wilderness.Some\nwere to eke out a life of widowhood in poverty.All were to live\nsoberly, chastened by what they had seen.A fear knocked at Colonel\nCarvel\'s heart as he stood watching the bright figures."Brinsmade," he said, "do you remember this room in May, \'46?"Brinsmade, startled, turned upon him quickly."Why, Colonel, you have read my very thoughts," he said."Some of those\nwho were here then are--are still in Mexico.""And some who came home, Brinsmade, blamed God because they had not\nfallen," said the Colonel."Hush, Comyn, His will be done," he answered; "He has left a daughter to\ncomfort you."In her gown of faded primrose\nand blue with its quaint stays and short sleeves, she seemed to have\ncaught the very air of the decorous century to which it belonged.She\nwas standing against one of the pilasters at the side of the\nroom, laughing demurely at the antics of Becky Sharp and Sir John\nFalstaff,--Miss Puss Russell and Mr.Tennyson\'s "Idylls" having appeared but the year before, Anne was\ndressed as Elaine, a part which suited her very well.It was strange\nindeed to see her waltzing with Daniel Boone (Mr.Clarence Colfax)\nin his Indian buckskins.Eugenie went as Marie Antoinette.Tall Maude\nCatherwood was most imposing as Rebecca; and her brother George made a\ntowering Friar Tuck, Even little fifteen-year-old Spencer Catherwood,\nthe contradiction of the family, was there.He went as the lieutenant\nNapoleon, walking about with his hands behind his back and his brows\nthoughtfully contracted.It was at tine very height of the\nfestivities that Dorothy Carvel and Mr.Daniel Boone were making their\nway together to the porch when the giant gate-keeper of Kenilworth\nCastle came stalking up the steps out of the darkness, brandishing his\nclub in their faces.Dorothy screamed, and even the doughty Daniel gave\nback a step."I\'m sorry, Jinny, indeed I am," said the giant, repentant, and holding\nher hand in his.demanded Virginia, a little mollified."I\'ve been to a Lincoln meeting," said honest Tom; "where I heard a very\nfine speech from a friend of yours.""You might have been better employed," said she, and added, with\ndignity, "I have no friends who speak at Black Republican meetings.""No," said Tom, "I meant--"\n\nHe got no further.Virginia slipped her arm through Clarence\'s, and they\nwent off together to the end of the veranda.He passed on into\nthe gay drawing-room, but the zest had been taken out of his antics for\nthat night."Whom did he mean, Jinny?"said Clarence, when they were on the seat\nunder the vines."He meant that Yankee, Stephen Brice," answered Virginia, languidly."I\nam so tired of hearing about him.""So am I," said Clarence, with a fervor by no means false."By George,\nI think he will make a Black Republican out of Tom, if he keeps on.Puss and Jack have been talking about him all summer, until I am out\nof patience.But suppose he has addressed fifty\nLincoln meetings, as they say, is that any reason for making much\nof him?I should not have him at Bellegarde."He is on the Brinsmade charity list.""He is not on their charity list, nor on any other," said Virginia,\nquickly."Stephen Brice is the last person who would submit to charity.""And you are the last person who I supposed would stand up for him,"\ncried her cousin, surprised and nettled."I want to be fair, Max," she said quietly."Pa offered them our Glencoe\nHouse last summer at a low price, and they insisted on paying what\nMr.Edwards gave five years ago,--or nothing.You know that I detest\na Yankee as much as you do," she continued, indignation growing in her\nvoice."I did not come out here with you to be insulted."With her hand on the rail, she made as if to rise.Clarence was perforce\nmollified."Don\'t go, Jinny," he said beseechingly."I didn\'t mean to make you\nangry--"\n\n"I can\'t see why you should always be dragging in this Mr.Brice," she\nsaid, almost tearfully.(It will not do to pause now and inquire into\nVirginia\'s logic.)"I came out to hear what you had to tell me.""Jinny, I have been made second lieutenant of Company A.""Oh, Max, I am so glad!"I suppose that you have heard the result of the October elections,\nJinny.""Pa said something about them to-night," she answered; "why?""It looks now as if there were a chance of the Republicans winning," he\nanswered.But it was elation that caught his voice, not gloom."You mean that this white trash Lincoln may be President?""The South will not submit to that until every man\nwho can bear arms is shot down."The strains of a waltz\nmingled with talk and laughter floated out of the open window.His voice\ndropped to a low intensity."We are getting ready in Company A," he\nsaid; "the traitors will be dropped.We are getting ready to fight for\nMissouri and for the South."The girl felt his excitement, his exaltation."And if you were not, Max, I should disown you," she whispered.He leaned forward until his face was close to hers."I am ready to work, to starve, to go to prison, to help--"\n\nHe sank back heavily into the corner."Oh, if a woman could only do more!"Do you remember\nwhen you told me that I was good for nothing, that I lacked purpose?""I have thought it over since," he went on rapidly; "you were right.I\ncannot work--it is not in me.But I have always felt that I could make a\nname for myself--for you--in the army.I am sure that I could command a\nregiment.She did not answer him, but absently twisted the fringe of his buckskins\nin her fingers."Ever since I have known what love is I have loved you, Jinny.It was so\nwhen we climbed the cherry trees at Bellegarde.And you loved me then--I\nknow you did.You loved me when I went East to school at the Military\nInstitute.But it has not been the same of late," he faltered.I felt it first on that day you rode out to\nBellegarde when you said that my life was of no use.Jinny, I don\'t ask\nmuch.War is coming, and we shall have\nto free ourselves from Yankee insolence.It is what we have both wished\nfor.When I am a general, will you marry me?"For a wavering instant she might have thrown herself into his\noutstretched arms.Why not, and have done with sickening doubts?Perhaps\nher hesitation hung on the very boyishness of his proposal.Perhaps the\nrevelation that she did not then fathom was that he had not developed\nsince those childish days.But even while she held back, came the beat\nof hoofs on the gravel below them, and one of the Bellegarde servants\nrode into the light pouring through the open door.Clarence muttered his dismay as he followed his cousin to the steps."Nothing; I forgot to sign the deed to the Elleardsville property,\nand Worington wants it to-night."Cutting short <DW71>\'s explanations,\nClarence vaulted on the horse.Leaning over\nin the saddle, he whispered: "I\'ll be back in a quarter of an hour Will\nyou wait?""Yes," she said, so that he barely heard.He was away at a gallop, leaving Virginia standing bareheaded to the\nnight, alone.A spring of pity, of affection for Clarence suddenly\nwelled up within her.There came again something of her old admiration\nfor a boy, impetuous and lovable, who had tormented and defended her\nwith the same hand.Patriotism, stronger in Virginia than many of us now can conceive, was\non Clarence\'s side.Now was she all\nafire with the thought that she, a woman, might by a single word\ngive the South a leader.That word would steady him, for there was no\nquestion of her influence.She trembled at the reckless lengths he might\ngo in his dejection, and a memory returned to her of a day at Glencoe,\nbefore he had gone off to school, when she had refused to drive with\nhim.Colonel Carvel had been away from home.In spite of Ned\'s beseechings Clarence had ridden off on a wild\nthoroughbred colt and had left her to an afternoon of agony.Vividly\nshe recalled his home-coming in the twilight, his coat torn and muddy, a\nbleeding cut on his forehead, and the colt quivering tame.In those days she had thought of herself unreservedly as meant for\nhim.Dash and courage and generosity had been the beacon lights on her\nhorizon.Yes, and Clarence\nshould have these, too.She also had been\nat fault, and perhaps it was because of her wavering loyalty to him that\nhe had not gained them.Her name spoken within the hall startled Virginia from her reverie, and\nshe began to walk rapidly down the winding drive.A fragment of the air\nto which they were dancing brought her to a stop.It was the Jenny Lind\nwaltz.And with it came clear and persistent the image she had sought to\nshut out and failed.As if to escape it now, she fairly ran all the way\nto the light at the entrance and hid in the magnolias clustered beside\nthe gateway.It was her cousin\'s name she whispered over and over to\nherself as she waited, vibrant with a strange excitement.It was as\nthough the very elements might thwart her wail.Clarence would be\ndelayed, or they would miss her at the house, and search.It seemed an\neternity before she heard the muffled thud of a horse cantering in the\nclay road.Virginia stood out in the light fairly between the gate posts.Too late\nshe saw the horse rear as the rider flew back in his seat, for she had\nseized the bridle.The beams from the lamp fell upon a Revolutionary\nhorseman, with cooked hat and sword and high riding-boots.For her his\nprofile was in silhouette, and the bold nose and chin belonged to but\none man she knew.She gave a cry of astonishment\nand dropped the rein in dismay.Her\nimpulse was to fly, nor could she tell what force that stayed her feet.As for Stephen, he stood high in his stirrups and stared down at the\ngirl.She was standing full in the light,--her lashes fallen, her face\ncrimson.But no sound of surprise escaped him because it was she, nor\ndid he wonder at her gown of a gone-by century.Her words came first,\nand they were low."I--I thought that you were my cousin," she said.She gave a step backward, and raised her frightened eyes to his."I can\'t say why," he said quickly, "but it seems to me as if this had\nhappened before.I know that I am talking nonsense--"\n\nVirginia was trembling now.And her answer was not of her own choosing."It may have been in a dream," he answered her, "that I saw you as you\nstand there by my bridle.And what mystery\nwas it that sent him here this night of all nights?She could not even\nhave said that it was her own voice making reply."And I--I have seen you, with the sword, and the powdered hair, and the\nblue coat and the buff waistcoat.It is a buff waistcoat like that my\ngreat-grandfather wears in his pictures.""It is a buff waistcoat," he said, all sense of strangeness gone.The roses she held dropped on the gravel, and she put out her hand\nagainst his horse\'s flank.In an instant he had leaped from his saddle,\nand his arm was holding her.She did not resist, marvelling rather at\nhis own steadiness, nor did she then resent a tenderness in his voice."I hope you will forgive me--Virginia," he said."It was I who stopped you," she said; "I was waiting for--"\n\n"For whom?"Colfax," she answered, in another tone.And as she\nspoke she drew away from him, up the driveway.But she had scarcely\ntaken five steps whey she turned again, her face burning defiance."They\ntold me you were not coming," she said almost fiercely."You know I would not have been\nhere had I thought you were coming.Anne promised me that you would not\ncome."What would she not have given for those words back again\n\nStephen took astride toward her, and to the girl that stride betokened a\nthousand things that went to the man\'s character.Within its compass the\ncomparison in her mind was all complete.He was master of himself when\nhe spoke."You dislike me, Miss Carvel," he said steadily.Nor do I flatter myself that it is only because you believe one thing,\nand I another.But I assure you that it is my misfortune rather than my\nfault that I have not pleased you,--that I have met you only to anger\nyou."He paused, for she did not seem to hear him.She was gazing at the\ndistant lights moving on the river.Had he come one step farther?--but\nhe did not.Presently she knew that he was speaking again, in the same\nmeasured tone."Had Miss Brinsmade told me that my presence here would cause you\nannoyance, I should have stayed away.I hope that you will think nothing\nof the--the mistake at the gate.You may be sure that I shall not\nmention it.He lifted his hat, mounted his horse, and was gone.She had not even\nknown that he could ride--that was strangely the first thought.The\nsecond discovered herself intent upon the rhythm of his canter as it\ndied southward upon the road.There was shame in this, mingled with a\nthankfulness that he would not meet Clarence.She hurried a few steps\ntoward the house, and stopped again.Ringing there was her talk with\nStephen Brice, as though it were still rapidly going on.His questions\nand her replies--over and over again.Each trivial incident of an\nencounter real and yet unreal!His transformation in the uniform, which\nhad seemed so natural.Though she strove to make it so, nothing of all\nthis was unbearable now, nor the remembrance of the firm torch of his\narm about her nor yet again his calling her by her name.Absently she took her way again up the drive, now pausing, now going on,\nforgetful.First it was alarm she felt when her cousin leaped down at\nher side,--then dread."I thought I should never get back," he cried breathlessly, as he threw\nhis reins to <DW71>."I ought not to have asked you to wait outside.She answered something, There was a seat near by under the trees.To\nlead her to it he seized her hand, but it was limp and cold, and a\nsudden fear came into his voice.She remembered long how he\nstood in the scattered light from the bright windows, a tall, black\nfigure of dismay.But her own\nresponse, warm half an hour since, was lifeless."Jinny," he said, "what is the matter?"Only I was very foolish to say I would wait for you.""Then--then you won\'t marry me?""Oh, Max," she cried, "it is no time to talk of that now.I feel\nto-night as if something dreadful were to happen.""But war is what we want," he cried, "what we have prayed for, what we\nhave both been longing for to-night, Jinny.War alone will give us our\nrights--"\n\nHe stopped short.Virginia had bowed her head an her hands, and he saw\nher shoulders shaken by a sob.Clarence bent over her in bewilderment\nand anxiety."You are not well, Jinny," he said.But when they went in at the door, he saw that her eyes were dry.Those were the days when a dozen young ladies were in the habit of\nstaying all night after a dance in the country; of long whispered talks\n(nay, not always whispered) until early morning.Miss Russell had not been the only one who remarked Virginia\'s long\nabsence with her cousin; but Puss found her friend in one of those moods\nwhich even she dared not disturb.Accordingly Miss Russell stayed all\nnight with Anne.And the two spent most of the dark hours remaining in unprofitable\ndiscussion as to whether Virginia were at last engaged to her cousin,\nand in vain queried over another unsolved mystery.This mystery was\ntaken up at the breakfast table the next morning, when Miss Carvel\nsurprised Mrs.Brinsmade and the male household by appearing at\nhalf-past seven.Brinsmade, "what does this mean?I always\nthought that young ladies did not get up after a ball until noon.""I am going to ask you to take me to town when you go, Mr."Why, certainly, my dear," he said."But I under stood that your aunt\nwas to send for you this afternoon from Bellegarde.""There is something I wish to do in town.""I\'ll drive her in, Pa," said Jack.Will you go with\nme, Jinny?""But you must eat some breakfast, Jinny," said Mrs Brinsmade, glancing\nanxiously at the girl."Where was Stephen Brice last night, Jack?""I understood Anne\nto say that he had spoke; of coming late.""Why, sir," said Jack, "that\'s what we can\'t make out.Tom Catherwood,\nwho is always doing queer things, you know, went to a Black Republican\nmeeting last night, and met Stephen there.They came out in Tom\'s buggy\nto the Russells\', and Tom got into his clothes first and rode over.Stephen was to have followed on Puss Russell\'s horse.At least I can find no one who saw him.But Virginia did not raise her eyes from her plate."There might have been an accident, Jack," said that lady, with concern."Send Nicodemus over to Mrs.Brice is a Northerner, and may not be able to ride.""He rides like a dragoon, mother," said he."I don\'t know where he\npicked it up.""The reason I mentioned him," said Mr.Brinsmade, lifting the blanket\nsheet and adjusting his spectacles, "was because his name caught my eye\nin this paper.His speech last night at the Library Hall is one of the\nfew sensible Republican speeches I have read.I think it very remarkable\nfor a man as young as he."Brinsmade began to read: "\'While waiting\nfor the speaker of the evening, who was half an hour late, Mr.Tiefel\nrose in the audience and called loudly for Mr.Many citizens in\nthe hall were astonished at the cheering which followed the mention\nof this name.Brice is a young lawyer with a quiet manner and a\ndetermined face, who has sacrificed much to the Party\'s cause this\nsummer.He was introduced by Judge Whipple, in whose office he is.He had hardly begun to speak before he had the ear of everyone in the\nhouse.Brice\'s personality is prepossessing, his words are spoken\nsharply, and he has a singular emphasis at times which seems to drive\nhis arguments into the minds of his hearers.We venture to say that if\nparty orators here and elsewhere were as logical and temperate as Mr.Brice; if, like him, they appealed to reason rather than to passion,\nthose bitter and lamentable differences which threaten our country\'s\npeace might be amicably adjusted.\'But he was interrupted by the rising of Virginia.A high color was on\nthe girl\'s face as she said:\n\n"Please excuse me, Mrs.Brinsmade, I must go and get ready.""But you\'ve eaten nothing, my dear.""You ought not have read that, Pa," Mr.Jack remonstrated; "you know\nthat she detests Yankees."THE BREACH BECOMES TOO WIDE ABRAHAM LINCOLN!At the foot of Breed\'s Hill in Charlestown an American had been born\ninto the world, by the might of whose genius that fateful name was\nsped to the uttermost parts of the nation.Abraham Lincoln was elected\nPresident of the United States.And the moan of the storm gathering in\nthe South grew suddenly loud and louder.Stephen Brice read the news in the black headlines and laid down the\nnewspaper, a sense of the miraculous upon him.There again was the\nangled, low-celled room of the country tavern, reeking with food and\nlamps and perspiration; for a central figure the man of surpassing\nhomeliness,--coatless, tieless, and vestless,--telling a story in\nthe vernacular.He reflected that it might well seem strange yea, and\nintolerable--to many that this comedian of the country store, this crude\nlawyer and politician, should inherit the seat dignified by Washington\nand the Adamses.For to him had been vouchsafed the glimpse\nbeyond.That was a dark winter that followed, the darkest in our history.Gloom\nand despondency came fast upon the heels of Republican exultation.Men\nrose early for tidings from Charleston, the storm centre.Would it crumble in pieces before Abraham\nLincoln got to Washington?One smoky morning early in December Stephen arrived late at the office\nto find Richter sitting idle on his stool, concern graven on his face."The Judge has had no breakfast, Stephen," he whispered.Shadrach tells me he has been doing that since six this morning, when he\ngot his newspaper."Stephen listened, and he heard the Judge pacing and pacing in his room.Presently the door was flung open, And they saw Mr.Whipple standing in\nthe threshold, stern and dishevelled.He came out and sat down in Stephen\'s chair, striking the newspaper in\nhis hand, and they feared at first that his Mind had wandered.he cried, "propitiate, propitiate, and again propitiate.Suddenly he turned upon Stephen, who was frightened.But now his voice was natural, and he thrust the paper into the young\nman\'s lap."Have you read the President\'s message to Congress, sir?God\nhelp me that I am spared to call that wobbling Buchanan President.Perhaps you can tell me why,\nif a man admits that it is wrong for a state to abandon this Union, he\ncannot call upon Congress for men and money to bring her back.No, this\nweakling lets Floyd stock the Southern arsenals.He is for bribing them not to be angry.Take Cuba from Spain,\nsays he, and steal the rest of Mexico that the maw of slavery may be\nfilled, and the demon propitiated."And so he went back into his room, shutting\nthe door.That day no clients saw him, even those poor ones dependent\non his charity whom had never before denied.Richter and Stephen took\ncounsel together, and sent Shadrach out for his dinner.There arrived a sparkling Sunday, brought down the\nvalley of the Missouri from the frozen northwest.The Saturday had been\nsoggy and warm.Thursday had seen South Carolina leave that Union into which she was\nborn, amid prayers and the ringing of bells.A young lady, who had listened to a solemn sermon of Dr.Posthelwaite\'s, slipped out of Church before the prayers were ended,\nand hurried into that deserted portion of the town about the Court House\nwhere on week days business held its sway.She stopped once at the bottom of the grimy flight of steps leading to\nJudge Whipple\'s office.At the top she paused again, and for a short\nspace stood alert, her glance resting on the little table in the corner,\non top of which a few thumbed law books lay neatly piled.Once she made\na hesitating step in this direction.Then, as if by a resolution quickly\ntaken, she turned her back and softly opened the door of the Judge\'s\nroom.A book was open in his lap,\nbut it did not seem to Virginia that he was reading it."Uncle Silas," she said, "aren\'t you coming to dinner any more?"He looked up swiftly from under his shaggy brows."Uncle Silas," said Virginia, bravely, "I came to get you to-day."Never before had she known him to turn away from man or woman, but now\nJudge Whipple drew his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose\nviolently.A woman\'s intuition told her that locked tight in his heart\nwas what he longed to say, and could not.The shiny black overcoat he\nwore was on the bed.Virginia picked it up and held it out to him, an\nappeal in her eyes.Many people walking home\nfrom church that morning marvelled as they saw these two on Locust\nStreet together, the young girl supporting the elderly man over the\nslippery places at the crossings.For neighbor had begun to look coldly\nupon neighbor.Colonel Carvel beheld them from his armchair by the sitting-room window,\nand leaned forward with a start.His lips moved as he closed his Bible\nreverently and marked his place.At the foot of the stairs he surprised\nJackson by waving him aside, for the Colonel himself flung open the door\nand held out his hand to his friend.The Judge released Virginia\'s arm,\nand his own trembled as he gave it."Silas," said the Colonel, "Silas, we\'ve missed you."Virginia stood by, smiling, but her breath came deeply.Judge Whipple did not go in at the\ndoor--He stood uncompromisingly planted on the threshold, his head flung\nback, and actual fierceness in his stare."Do you guess we can keep off the subject, Comyn?"Carvel, so used to the Judge\'s ways, was a bit taken aback by\nthis question.It set him tugging at his goatee, and his voice was not\nquite steady as he answered:\n\n"God knows, Silas.We are human, and we can only try."It lacked a quarter of an hour of\ndinner,--a crucial period to tax the resources of any woman.Virginia\nled the talk, but oh, the pathetic lameness of it.Her own mind was\nwandering when it should not, and recollections she had tried to\nstrangle had sprung up once more.Only that morning in church she had\nlived over again the scene by Mr.Brinsmade\'s gate, and it was then that\na wayward but resistless impulse to go to the Judge\'s office had seized\nher.The thought of the old man lonely and bitter in his room decided\nher.On her knees she prayed that she might save the bond between him\nand her father.For the Colonel had been morose on Sundays, and had\ntaken to reading the Bible, a custom he had not had since she was a\nchild.In the dining-room Jackson, bowing and smiling, pulled out the Judge\'s\nchair, and got his customary curt nod as a reward."Oh, Uncle Silas," she cried, "I am so glad that we have a wild turkey.The girl carved deftly, feverishly,\ntalking the while, aided by that most kind and accomplished of hosts,\nher father.In the corner the dreaded skeleton of the subject grinned\nsardonically.Were they going to be able to keep it off?There was to be\nno help from Judge Whipple, who sat in grim silence.A man who feels\nhis soul burning is not given to small talk.Virginia alone had ever\npossessed the power to make him forget."Uncle Silas, I am sure there are some things about our trip that we\nnever told you.How we saw Napoleon and his beautiful Empress driving\nin the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and bowed at the people.I never\nsaw such enthusiasm in my life.And oh, I learned such a lot of French\nhistory.All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus\nalong the Loire.You really ought to have\ngone with us.""I had other work to do, Jinny," said the Judge."I told you that we stayed with a real lord in England, didn\'t I?""He wasn\'t half as nice as the Prince.But he had a beautiful house\nin Surrey, all windows, which was built in Elizabeth\'s time.They called\nthe architecture Tudor, didn\'t they, Pa?""Yes, dear," said the Colonel, smiling."The Countess was nice to me," continued the girl, "and took me to\ngarden parties.But Lord Jermyn was always talking politics."The Colonel was stroking his goatee."Tell Silas about the house, Jinny--Jackson, help the Judge again.""No," said Virginia, drawing a breath."I\'m going to tell him about that\nqueer club where my great-grand-father used to bet with Charles Fox.We\nsaw a great many places where Richard Carvel had been in England.Uncle Daniel read me some of his memoirs when\nwe were at Calvert House.I know that you would be interested in them,\nUncle Silas."And fought for his country and for his flag, Virginia," said the Judge,\nwho had scarcely spoken until then."No, I could not bear to read them\nnow, when those who should love that country are leaving it in passion."Virginia did not dare to look at her father.But the Colonel said, gently:\n\n"Not in passion, Silas, but in sorrow."But the effort was beyond him, and the\nflood within him broke loose."Colonel Carvel," he cried, "South Carolina is mad--She is departing in\nsin, in order that a fiendish practice may be perpetuated.If her people\nstopped to think they would know that slavery cannot exist except by\nmeans of this Union.But let this milksop of a President do his worst.We have chosen a man who has the strength to say, \'You shall not go!\'"The saving grace of it was that respect and love\nfor her father filled Virginia\'s heart.In his just anger Colonel\nCarvel remembered that he was the host, and strove to think only of his\naffection for his old friend."To invade a sovereign state, sir, is a crime against the sacred spirit\nof this government," he said."There is no such thing as a sovereign state, sir," exclaimed the Judge,\nhotly."I am an American, and not a Missourian.""When the time comes, sir," said the Colonel, with dignity, "Missouri\nwill join with her sister sovereign states against oppression.""Missouri will not secede, sir.""Because, sir, when the worst comes, the Soothing Syrup men will rally\nfor the Union.And there are enough loyal people here to keep her\nstraight."Foreign Republican hirelings, sir," exclaimed\nthe Colonel, standing up."We shall drive them like sheep if they oppose\nus.You are drilling them now that they may murder your own blood when\nyou think the time is ripe."The Colonel did not hear Virginia leave the room, so softly had she\ngone, He made a grand figure of a man as he stood up, straight and tall,\nthose gray eyes a-kindle at last.But the fire died as quickly as it had\nflared.Pity had come and quenched it,--pity that an unselfish life\nof suffering and loneliness should be crowned with these.The Colonel\nlonged then to clasp his friend in his arms.Quarrels they had had\nby the hundred, never yet a misunderstanding.God had given to Silas\nWhipple a nature stern and harsh that repelled all save the charitable\nfew whose gift it was to see below the surface, and Colonel Carvel had\nbeen the chief of them.But now the Judge\'s vision was clouded.Steadying himself by his chair, he had risen glaring, the loose skin\ntwitching on his sallow face.He began firmly but his voice shook ere he\nhad finished."Colonel Carvel," said he, "I expect that the day has come when you\ngo your way and I go mine.It will be better if--we do not meet again,\nsir."And so he turned from the man whose friendship had stayed him for the\nscore of years he had battled with his enemies, from that house which\nhad been for so long his only home.For the last time Jackson came\nforward to help him with his coat.The Judge did not see him, nor did he\nsee the tearful face of a young girl leaning over the banisters above.Whipple, blinded by a moisture strange to\nhis eyes, clung to the iron railing as he felt his way down the steps.Before he reached the bottom a stronger arm had seize his own, and was\nhelping him.The Judge brushed his eyes with his sleeve, and turned a defiant face\nupon Captain Elijah Brent--then his voice broke.His anger was\nsuddenly gone, and his thought had flown back to the Colonel\'s thousand\ncharities."Lige," he said, "Lige, it has come."In answer the Captain pressed the Judge\'s hand, nodding vigorously to\nhide his rising emotion.cried the Captain, "I wish I knew.""Lige," said the Judge, gravely, "you\'re too good a man to be for\nSoothing Syrup.""You\'re too smart to be fooled, Lige," he said, with a note near to\npleading."The time has come when you Bell people and the Douglas people\nhave got to decide.Never in my life did I know it to do good to dodge\na question.We\'ve got to be white or black, Lige.Nobody\'s got much\nuse for the grays.And don\'t let yourself be fooled with Constitutional\nUnion Meetings, and compromises.The time is almost here, Lige, when it\nwill take a rascal to steer a middle course."Captain Lige listened, and he shifted from one foot to the other, and\nrubbed his hands, which were red.Some odd trick of the mind had put\ninto his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme."Lige, you\'ve got to decide.Can you look\non while our own states defy us, and not lift a hand?Can you sit still\nwhile the Governor and all the secessionists in this state are plotting\nto take Missouri, too, out of the Union?The militia is riddled with\nrebels, and the rest are forming companies of minute men.""And you Black Republicans," the Captain cried "have organized your\nDutch Wideawakes, and are arming them to resist Americans born.""They are Americans by our Constitution, sir, which the South pretends\nto revere," cried the Judge."And they are showing themselves better\nAmericans than many who have been on the soil for generations.""My sympathies are with the South," said the Captain, doggedly, "and my\nlove is for the South."Both men raised their eyes to the house of him\nwhose loving hospitality had been a light in the lives of both.When at\nlast the Captain spoke, his voice was rent with feeling."Judge," he began, "when I was a poor young man on the old \'Vicksburg\',\nsecond officer under old Stetson, Colonel Carvel used to take me up to\nhis house on Fourth Street to dinner.And he gave me the clothes on\nmy back, so that I might not be ashamed before the fashion which came\nthere.One day the sheriff sold the\nVicksburg.That left me high and dry in the mud.And he says to me, \'Lige, you\'re\ncaptain now, the youngest captain on the river.You\ncan pay me principal and interest when you get ready.\'"Judge Whipple, I never had any other home than right in, this house.I\nnever had any other pleasure than bringing Jinny presents, and tryin\' to\nshow \'em gratitude.He took me into his house and cared for me at a time\nwhen I wanted to go to the devil along with the stevedores when I was\na wanderer he kept me out of the streets, and out of temptation.Judge,\nI\'d a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in\nhere and tell him I\'d fight for the North."The Judge steadied himself on his hickory stick and walked off without\na word.For a while Captain Lige stood staring after him.Then he slowly\nclimbed the steps and disappeared.MUTTERINGS\n\nEarly in the next year, 1861,--that red year in the Calendar of our\nhistory,--several gentlemen met secretly in the dingy counting-room of\na prominent citizen to consider how the state of Missouri might be saved\nto the Union.One of these gentlemen was Judge Whipple, another, Mr.Brinsmade; and another a masterly and fearless lawyer who afterward\nbecame a general, and who shall be mentioned in these pages as the\nLeader.By his dash and boldness and statesmanlike grasp of a black\nsituation St.Louis was snatched from the very bosom of secession.Alas, that chronicles may not stretch so as to embrace all great men of\na time.There is Captain Nathaniel Lyon,--name with the fateful ring.Nathaniel Lyon, with the wild red hair and blue eye, born and bred a\nsoldier, ordered to St.Louis, and become subordinate to a wavering\nofficer of ordnance.Lyon was one who brooked no trifling.He had the\nface of a man who knows his mind and intention; the quick speech and\naction which go with this.Red tape made by the reel to bind him, he\nbroke.Courts-martial had no terrors for him.He proved the ablest of\nlieutenants to the strong civilian who was the Leader.If God had willed that the South should win, there\nwould have been no occasion.Even as Judge Whipple had said, the time was come for all men to decide.Out of the way, all hopes of compromises that benumbed Washington.No\nConstitutional Unionists, no Douglas Democrats, no Republicans now.The speech-making was not done with yet.Partisanship must be overcome, and patriotism instilled in its place.One day Stephen Brice saw the Leader go into Judge Whipple\'s room,\nand presently he was sent for.After that he was heard of in various\nout-of-the-way neighborhoods, exhorting all men to forget their quarrels\nand uphold the flag.The Leader himself knew not night from day in his toil,--in organizing,\nconciliating, compelling when necessary.And, after that solemn inauguration, between him and\nWashington.It was an open secret that the Governor of Missouri held out\nhis arms to Jefferson Davis, just elected President of the new Southern\nConfederacy.It soon became plain to the feeblest brain what the Leader\nand his friends had perceived long before, that the Governor intended\nto use the militia (purged of Yankee sympathizers) to save the state for\nthe South.The Government Arsenal, with its stores of arms and ammunition, was\nthe prize.This building and its grounds lay to the south of the\nCity, overlooking the river.It was in command of a doubting major\nof ordnance; the corps of officers of Jefferson Barracks hard by was\nmottled with secession.In all the South, Pickens and Sumter alone stood\nstanch to the flag.A general, wearing the uniform of the army of the\nUnited States, surrendered the whole state of Texas.Louis Arsenal was next in succession, and the little band of\nregulars at the Barracks was powerless to save it.What could the Leader\nand Captain Lyon do without troops?That was the question that rang\nin Stephen\'s head, and in the heads of many others.For, if President\nLincoln sent troops to St.And the President had other uses for the handful in the army.There came a rain-sodden night when a mysterious message arrived at\nthe little house in Olive Street.Brice\'s eyes as they followed her son out of the door.At Twelfth\nStreet two men were lounging on the corners, each of whom glanced at\nhim listessly as he passed.He went up a dark and narrow stair into a\nlighted hall with shrouded windows.Men with sober faces were forming\nline on the sawdust of the floors.The Leader was there giving military\norders in a low voice.That marked the beginning of the aggressive Union\nmovement.Stephen, standing apart at the entrance, remarked that many of the men\nwere Germans.Indeed, he spied his friend Tiefel there, and presently\nRichter came from the ranks to greet him."My friend," he said, "you are made second lieutenant of our company,\nthe Black Jaegers.""But I have never drilled in my life," said Stephen.The Leader, smiling a little, put a vigorous stop to his protestations,\nand told him to buy a tactics.The next man Stephen saw was big Tom\nCatherwood, who blushed to the line of his hair as he returned Stephen\'s\ngrip."Well," said Tom, embarrassed, "a fellow has got to do what he think\'s\nright.""I reckon they\'ll disown me, Stephen, when they find it out."Richter walked home as far as Stephen\'s house.He was to take the Fifth\nStreet car for South St.And they talked of Tom\'s courage, and of\nthe broad and secret military organization the Leader had planned that\nnight.Could he afford to risk his life in the war that was coming, and leave\nhis mother dependent upon charity?It was shortly after this that Stephen paid his last visit for many a\nlong day upon Miss Puss Russell.It was a Sunday afternoon, and Puss was\nentertaining, as usual, a whole parlor-full of young men, whose leanings\nand sympathies Stephen divined while taking off his coat in the hall.Then he heard Miss Russell cry:\n\n"I believe that they are drilling those nasty Dutch hirelings in\nsecret.""I am sure they are," said George Catherwood."One of the halls is on\nTwelfth Street, and they have sentries posted out so that you can\'t get\nnear them.And he told him that if\nhe ever got evidence of it, he\'d show him the door.""Do you really think that Tom is with the Yankees?""Tom\'s a fool," said George, with emphasis, "but he isn\'t a coward.He\'d just as soon tell Pa to-morrow that he was drilling if the Yankee\nleaders wished it known.""Virginia will never speak to him again," said Eugenie, in an awed\nvoice.said Puss, "Tom never had a chance with Jinny.Did you ever know any one to change so,\nsince this military business has begun?I hear\nthat they are thinking of making him captain of a company of dragoons.""And that is the company I intend to join.""Well," began Puss, with her usual recklessness, "it\'s a good thing for\nClarence that all this is happening.I know somebody else--"\n\nPoor Stephen in the hall knew not whether to stay or fly.Emily Russell came down the stairs at that instant\nand spoke to him.As the two entered the parlor, there was a hush\npregnant with many things unsaid.Puss\'s face was scarlet, but her hand\nwas cold as she held it out to him.For the first time in that house\nhe felt like an intruder.Jack Brinsmade bowed with great ceremony,\nand took his departure.There was scarcely a distant cordiality in\nthe greeting of the other young men.And Puss, whose tongue was loosed\nagain, talked rapidly of entertainments to which Stephen either had not\nbeen invited, or from which he had stayed away.The rest of the company\nwere almost moodily silent.Profoundly depressed, Stephen sat straight in the velvet chair, awaiting\na seasonable time to bring his visit to a close.This was to be the last, then, of his intercourse with a warmhearted\nand lovable people.This was to be the end of his friendship with this\nimpetuous and generous girl who had done so much to brighten his life\nsince he had come to St: Louis.Henceforth this house would be shut to\nhim, and all others save Mr.Presently, in one of the intervals of Miss Russell\'s feverish talk,\nhe rose to go.Dusk was gathering, and a deep and ominous silence\npenetrated like the shadows into the tall room.Impulsively, almost tearfully, Puss put her hand in his.Then she\npressed it unexpectedly, so that he had to gulp down a lump that was in\nhis throat.Just then a loud cry was heard from without, the men jumped\nfrom their chairs, and something heavy dropped on the carpet.Some ran to the window, others to the door.Directly across the street\nwas the house of Mr.One of the third\nstory windows was open, and out of it was pouring a mass of gray wood\nsmoke.George Catherwood was the first to speak."I hope it will burn down," he cried.Stephen picked up the object on the floor, which had dropped from his\npocket, and handed it to him.THE GUNS OF SUMTER\n\nWinter had vanished.Toward a little island\nset in the blue waters of Charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained.God alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still\nhours of the night for the guns of Sumter.One sultry night in April\nStephen\'s mother awoke with fear in her heart, for she had heard them.that is the roar now, faint but sullen.That is the red flash\nfar across the black Southern sky.For in our beds are the terrors and\ncruelties of life revealed to us.There is a demon to be faced, and\nnought alone.The lightning revealed her as she bent over him.On the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great Boston\nhouse with the rounded front, and he saw the nursery with its high\nwindows looking out across the Common.Often in the dark had she come to\nhim thus, her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered.She said: "Stephen, I am afraid that the war has come."Even he did not guess the agony in her heart.We have nothing left but the little I\nearn.And if I were--" He did not finish the sentence, for he felt her\ntrembling.But she said again, with that courage which seems woman\'s\nalone:\n\n"Remember Wilton Brice.It was the hour he had dreaded, stolen suddenly upon him out of the\nnight.How many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself!He,\nStephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union,\na renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike!He had talked for his\ncountry, but he would not risk his life for it.He saw them passing him silently on the street.Shamefully\nhe remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very\nuniform of his Revolutionary ancestor.And high above the tier of his\naccusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of\nhis soul.Before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the\nstruggle, that face shining through the black veil of the darkness.If\nhe were to march away in the blue of his country (alas, not of hers!)she would respect him for risking life for conviction.If he stayed at\nhome, she would not understand.And\nyet he knew that Virginia Carvel and the women like her were ready to\nfollow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the South.The rain was come now, in a flood.Stephen\'s mother could not see in the\nblackness the bitterness on his face.Above the roar of the waters she\nlistened for his voice."I will not go, mother," he said."If at length every man is needed,\nthat will be different.""It is for you to decide, my son," she answered."There are many ways in\nwhich you can serve your country here.But remember that you may have to\nface hard things.""I have had to do that before, mother," he replied calmly."I cannot\nleave you dependent upon charity."She went back into her room to pray, for she knew that he had laid his\nambition at her feet.It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came.All through\nthe Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked\non.Through a wide land was that numbness which\nprecedes action.Force of habit sent men to their places of business,\nto sit idle.South\nCarolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered.On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers.The outraged reply of her governor\nwent back,--never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states.Little did Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of\nall the Union in the number of men she was to give.To her was credited\nin the end even more men than stanch Massachusetts.The noise of preparation was in the city--in the land.On the Monday\nmorning, when Stephen went wearily to the office, he was met by Richter\nat the top of the stairs, who seized his shoulders and looked into his\nface.The light of the zealot was on Richter\'s own."We shall drill every night now, my friend, until further orders.Until we go to the front, Stephen, to put down\nrebellion."Stephen sank into a chair, and bowed his head.What would\nhe think,--this man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native\nland for his convictions?Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die\nfor them?How was he to confess to Richter, of all men?"Carl," he said at length, "I--I cannot go."But Richter, suddenly divining, laid his hands\nimpulsively on Stephen\'s shoulders."Ach, I see," he said.It shall be\nfor your mother while you are away."Then, in spite of\nhis feelings, he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his\ncharacter.implored Richter, "I would give a fortune, if\nI had it.Ah, my friend, that would please me so.And I do not need the\nmoney now.Spring was in the air; the first faint smell of verdure wafted across\nthe river on the wind.Stephen turned to the open window, tears of\nintense agony in his eyes.In that instant he saw the regiment marching,\nand the flag flying at its head."It is my duty to stay here, Carl," he said brokenly.Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped.He realized that\nwith this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable.In\nall his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change.With the\ndemonstrative sympathy of his race, he yearned to comfort him, and knew\nnot how.Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be\nbroken down.At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared.Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass\ndoor, scarce knowing what to expect,--and scarce caring, as on that\nfirst day he had gone in there.Whipple himself closed the door, and\nthen the transom.Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their\nhiding-place.Brice," he said at last, "the President has called for seventy-five\nthousand volunteers to crush this rebellion.They will go, and be\nswallowed up, and more will go to fill their places.Brice, people\nwill tell you that the war will be over in ninety days.But I tell you,\nsir, that it will not be over in seven times ninety days."He brought\ndown his fist heavily upon the table."This, sir, will be a war to the\ndeath.One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let,\nand until their homes are all ruins."He darted at Stephen one look from\nunder those fierce eyebrows."No, sir," he answered, steadily, "not\nnow."Then he began what seemed a never-ending search\namong the papers on his desk.At length he drew out a letter, put on his\nspectacles and read it, and finally put it down again.Whipple, "you are doing a courageous thing.But if\nwe elect to follow our conscience in this world, we must not expect to\nescape persecution, sir.Two weeks ago," he continued slowly, "two weeks\nago I had a letter from Mr.cried Stephen\n\nThe Judge smiled a little.Lincoln never forgets any one," said\nhe."He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the\nRepublican party, and sends you his kindest regards."This was the first and only time that Mr.Whipple spoke to him of his\nlabors.Stephen has often laughed at this since, and said that he\nwould not have heard of them at all had not the Judge\'s sense of duty\ncompelled him to convey the message.And it was with a lighter heart\nthan he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door.Some weeks later, five regiments were mustered into the service of the\nUnited States.And in response to his\nappeals, despite the presence of officers of higher rank, the President\nhad given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri.Stephen stood among the angry, jeering crowd that lined the streets as\nthe regiments marched past.Their step was not as steady, nor their files as straight\nas Company A. There was Richter, his head high, his blue eyes defiant.And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant\nthat Stephen himself should have filled.Here was another company,\nand at the end of the first four, big Tom Catherwood.His father\nhad disowned him the day before, His two brothers, George and little\nSpencer, were in a house not far away--a house from which a strange flag\ndrooped.Clouds were lowering over the city, and big drops falling, as Stephen\nthreaded his way homeward, the damp anal gloom of the weather in his\nvery soul.He went past the house where the strange flag hung against\nits staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged.The house\nwas thrown wide open that day, and in its window lounged young men of\nhonored families.And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee\ncowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to\nthe strange banner that they had set up.In the hall, through the open\ndoorway, the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen.The guardians\nwere the Minute Men, organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the\nstate of Missouri.Across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people,\nand among these Stephen paused.Two young men were standing on the\nsteps, and one was Clarence Colfax.His hands were in his pockets, and\na careless, scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the\nstreet.Anger swept over him in a hot flame,\nas at the slave auction years agone.That was the unquenchable fire of\nthe war.The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyed,--and yet\nhe stopped.What right had he to pull down that flag, to die on the pavement before\nthat house?CAMP JACKSON\n\nWhat enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning, the Sixth of May, 1861!Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred\nfeet across, and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is\ngathering there.Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to\nCamp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction.Half a mile nearer the river, on the house of the Minute Men, the\nstrange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day.On Twelfth Street the sun is shining, drums are beating, and bands\nare playing, and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited\nchargers.One by one the companies are marching up, and taking place in\nline; the city companies in natty gray fatigue, the country companies\noften in their Sunday clothes.But they walk with heads erect and chests\nout, and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them.Louis Grays, Company A; there come the Washington\nGuards and Washington Blues, and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and\nDavis Guards.Yes, this is Secession Day, this Monday.And the colors\nare the Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed.A clatter and a\ncloud of dust by the market place, an ecstasy of cheers running in waves\nthe length of the crowd.Here they come\nat last, four and four, the horses prancing and dancing and pointing\nquivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons.Maude Catherwood squeezes Virginia\'s arm.There, riding in front, erect\nand firm in the saddle, is Captain Clarence Colfax.Virginia is red and\nwhite, and red again,--true colors of the Confederacy.Oh, that was his true\ncalling, a soldier\'s life.In that moment she saw him at the head of\narmies, from the South, driving the Yankee hordes northward and still\nnorthward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation.Down to a trot they slow, Clarence\'s black thorough-bred arching his\nlong neck, proud as his master of the squadron which follows, four and\nfour.The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four, whose\nhorse is built like a Crusader\'s, is George Catherwood.And Eugenie\ngives a cry and points to the rear where Maurice is riding.Can the Yankee regiments with their\nslouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it!If there are any Yankees in Twelfth\nStreet that day, they are silent.And there are\nsome, even in the ranks of this Militia--who will fight for the Union.There is another wait, the companies standing at ease.Some of the\ndragoons dismount, but not the handsome young captain, who rides\nstraight to the bright group which has caught his eye, Colonel Carvel\nwrings his gauntleted hand."Clarence, we are proud of you, sir," he says.And Virginia, repeats his words, her eyes sparkling, her fingers\ncaressing the silken curve of Jefferson\'s neck."Clarence, you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river.""Hush, Jinny," he answered, "we are merely going into camp to learn to\ndrill, that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes.""You will have your cousin court-martialed, my dear," said the Colonel.But he must needs press Virginia\'s hand\nfirst, and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his.Then he goes\noff at a slow canter to join his dragoons, waving his glove at them, and\nturning to give the sharp order, "Attention"!Once more she has swept from her heart\nevery vestige of doubt.Chosen\nunanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since, Clarence had\ntaken command like a veteran.George Catherwood and Maurice had told the\nstory.And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North.The bands are started, the general and\nstaff begin to move, and the column swings into the Olive Street road,\nfollowed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot, the horse cars\ncrowded.Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage, and\nbehind Ned, on the box, is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up, the\ngirls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front.Olive Street, now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley\nwires, was a country road then.Green trees took the place of crowded\nrows of houses and stores, and little "bob-tail" yellow cars were drawn\nby plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley, surrounded by\na board fence, known as Lindell Grove.It was then a resort, a picnic\nground, what is now covered by close residences which have long shown\nthe wear of time.Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd, the rich and the poor, the\nproprietor and the salesmen, to watch the soldiers pitch their tents\nunder the spreading trees.The gallant dragoons were off to the west,\nacross a little stream which trickled through the grounds.By the side\nof it Virginia and Maude, enchanted, beheld Captain Colfax shouting\nhis orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons, and\nstaggered under it to the line.The\nCaptain lost his temper, his troopers, perspiring over Gordian knots in\nthe ropes, uttered strange soldier oaths, while the mad wind which blew\nthat day played a hundred pranks.To the discomfiture of the young ladies, Colonel Carvel pulled his\ngoatee and guffawed."How mean, Pa," she said indignantly."How car, you expect them to do it\nright the first day, and in this wind?""He is pulled\nover on his head."And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by\nlaughed, too."You will see that they can fight," she said."They can beat the Yankees\nand Dutch."This speech made the Colonel glance around him: Then he smiled,--in\nresponse to other smiles."My dear," he said, "you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of\ninstruction of the state militia.There fly the Stars and Stripes from\nthe general\'s tent.Do you see that they are above the state flag?Jinny stamped her foot\n\n"Oh, I hate dissimulation," she cried, "Why can\'t we, say outright that\nwe are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and\nHessians out of the Arsenal."She had forgotten that one of\nher brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians."Why aren\'t women made generals and governors?""If we were," answered Virginia, "something might be accomplished.""Isn\'t Clarence enough of a fire-eater to suit you?"But the tents were pitched, and at that moment the young Captain was\nseen to hand over his horse to an orderly, and to come toward them.He\nwas followed by George Catherwood."Come, Jinny," cried her cousin, "let us go over to the main camp.""And walk on Davis Avenue," said Virginia, flushing with pride."Yes, and a Lee Avenue, and a Beauregard Avenue," said George, taking\nhis sister\'s arm."We shall walk in them all," said Virginia.The rustling trees and the young grass\nof early May, and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military\nprecision.Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade, proud\nfathers and mothers, and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala\ndress.Wear your bright gowns now, you devoted women.The day is coming\nwhen you will make them over and over again, or tear them to lint, to\nstanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well.Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp\nJackson.All the fashion and beauty of the city were there.The bands\nplayed, the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses,\nand walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young\ngentlemen in white trousers and brass-buttoned jackets.All was not\nsoldier fare at the regimental messes.Cakes and jellies and even ices\nand more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents.Dress\nparade was one long sigh of delight: Better not to have been born than\nto have been a young man in St.Louis, early in Camp Jackson week, and\nnot be a militiaman.One young man whom we know, however, had little of pomp and vanity\nabout him,--none other than the young manager (some whispered "silent\npartner") of Carvel & Company.Eliphalet had had political\nambition, or political leanings, during the half-year which had just\npassed, he had not shown them.Cluyme (no mean business man himself)\nhad pronounced Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended\nto his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself.Seeing a regiment of\nMissouri Volunteers slouching down Fifth street in citizens\' clothes he\nhad been remarked to smile cynically.But he kept his opinions so close\nthat he was supposed not to have any.On Thursday of Camp Jackson week, an event occurred in Mr.Carvel\'s\nstore which excited a buzz of comment.Barbo, the book-keeper, that he should not be there after four o\'clock.To be sure, times were more than dull.The Colonel that morning had read\nover some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the\nimpossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the\ncountry.The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed.Hopper\'s equanimity was spoken of at the widow\'s\ntable.Hopper took an Olive Street car, tucking himself\ninto the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who\nmight enter.In the course of an hour or so, he alighted at the western\ngate of the camp on the Olive Street road.Refreshing himself with a\nlittle tobacco, he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between\nthe rows of tents.A philosophy of his own (which many men before and\nsince have adopted) permitted him to stare with a superior good nature\nat the open love-making around him.He imagined his own figure,--which\nwas already growing a little stout,--in a light gray jacket and duck\ntrousers, and laughed.Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that\nkind.These heroes might have their hero-worship.As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree, it so\nchanced that he was overtaken by Mr.Only\nthat morning, this gentleman, in glancing through the real estate column\nof his newspaper, had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink.He\nreminded his wife that Mr.Hopper had not been to supper of late.Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality.Hopper took it, the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own.But it may be well to remark that Mr.Hopper himself did not do any\nsqueezing.He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle."I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again, Mr."We only have plain and simple things, but they are\nwholesome, sir.Dainties are poor things to work on.I told that to his\nRoyal Highness when he was here last fall.He was speaking to me on the\nmerits of roast beef--"\n\n"It\'s a fine day," said Mr.Letting his gaze wander over the camp,\nhe added casually, "I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers\nsince yesterday.I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about,\nwhich came on the \'Swon\' marked\'marble.\'They say Jeff Davis sent the\nstuff to \'em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton\nRouge.They\'re pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now."He was not greatly interested in\nthis matter which had stirred the city to the quick.Cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved.Just then, as if to spare the\npains of a reply, a "Jenny Lind" passed them.Miss Belle recognized the\ncarriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known\nin St.Every day she drove out, dressed in black bombazine, and\nheavily veiled.As the mother-in-law of the stalwart\nUnion leader of the city, Miss Belle\'s comment about her appearance in\nCamp Jackson was not out of place.she exclaimed, "I\'d like to know what she\'s doing here!"Hopper\'s answer revealed a keenness which, in the course of a few\ndays, engendered in Mr.Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of."I don\'t know," said Eliphalet; "but I cal\'late she\'s got stouter.""That Union principles must be healthy," said he, and laughed.Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma.The appearance\nof two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind.Eliphalet, too, had seen them.One was the tall young Captain of\nDragoons, in cavalry boots, and the other a young lady with dark brown\nhair, in a lawn dress."They think they are alone in the\ngarden of Eden.But since he\'s\na captain, and has got a uniform, she\'s come round pretty quick.I\'m\nthankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms."She glanced at Eliphalet, to find that his eyes were fixed on the\napproaching couple."Clarence is handsome, but worthless," she continued in her sprightly\nway."I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him.Do you think\nshe\'s so very pretty, Mr."Neither do I," Miss Belle assented.And upon that, greatly to\nthe astonishment of Eliphalet, she left him and ran towards them.she cried; "Jinny, I have something so interesting to tell\nyou!"The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was\nnot one of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive.Putting her arm through\nVirginia\'s, she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds,\nClarence maintaining now a distance of three feet, and not caring to\nhide his annoyance.Eliphalet\'s eyes smouldered, following the three until they were lost\nin the crowd.That expression of Virginia\'s had reminded him of a\ntime, years gone, when she had come into the store on her return from\nKentucky, and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival.And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts.She has wealth, and manners,\nand looks.Too bad he holds such views\non secession.I have always thought, sir, that you were singularly\nfortunate in your connection with him."There was a point of light now in each of Mr.Cluyme continued:\n\n"What a pity, I say, that he should run the risk of crippling himself by\nhis opinions."And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on--"\n\nBut Mr.Cluyme has misjudged his man.If he had come to Eliphalet for\ninformation of Colonel Carvel\'s affairs, or of any one else\'s affairs,\nhe was not likely to get it.It is not meet to repeat here the long\nbusiness conversation which followed.Cluyme,\nwho was in dry goods himself, was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet\nas when he met him.But he had a greater respect than ever for the\nshrewdness of the business manager of Carvel & Company..........................\n\nThat same Thursday, when the first families of the city were whispering\njubilantly in each other\'s ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and\nstands of arms at Camp Jackson, something of significance was happening\nwithin the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal,\nfar to the southward.The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen.Richter gone, and the\nJudge often away in mysterious conference, he was left for hours at\na spell the sole tenant of the office.Fortunately there was work of\nRichter\'s and of Mr.Whipple\'s left undone that kept him busy.This\nThursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best\nblack coat which he wore on occasions.His manner had recently lost much\nof its gruffness."Stephen," said he, "they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the\nregiments at the arsenal.asked Stephen, when they had reached the\nstreet."Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the\nfirst trick, sir," said the Judge.As they got on the Fifth Street car, Stephen\'s attention was at once\nattracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner, with his children about\nhim.He was lean, and he had a face of great keenness and animation.He\nhad no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of\nmilitary abruptness."That is Major William T. Sherman," said the Judge to Stephen."He\nused to be in the army, and fought in the Mexican War.He came here two\nmonths ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line."They crossed over to him, the Judge introducing Stephen to Major\nSherman, who looked at him very hard, and then decided to bestow on him\na vigorous nod."Well, Whipple," he said, "this nation is going to the devil; eh?"For it was a bold man who expressed\nradical opinions (provided they were not Southern opinions) in a St."Who\'s man enough in Washington\nto shake his fist in a rebel\'s face?Our leniency--our timidity--has\nparalyzed us, sir."By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in\nthe conversation.Major Sherman paid them no attention, and the Judge,\nonce launched in an argument, forgot his surroundings."Seventy-five thousand for three months!"said the Major, vehemently,\n"a bucketful on a conflagration I tell you, Whipple, we\'ll need all the\nwater we\'ve got in the North."The Judge expressed his belief in this, and also that Mr.Lincoln would\ndraw all the water before he got through.Now\'s the time to stop\n\'em.The longer we let \'em rear and kick, the harder to break \'em.You\ndon\'t catch me going back to the army for three months.If they want me,\nthey\'ve got to guarantee me three years.Turning\nto Stephen, he added: "Don\'t you sign any three months\' contract, young\nman."By this time the car was full, and silent.No one had\noffered to quarrel with the Major.Nor did it seem likely that any one\nwould."I\'m afraid I can\'t go, sir.""Because, sir," said the Judge, bluntly, "his mother\'s a widow, and they\nhave no money.He was a lieutenant in one of Blair\'s companies before\nthe call came."The Major looked at Stephen, and his expression changed.Stephen\'s expression must have satisfied him, but he nodded again, more\nvigorously than before.But he hoped to fall out of the talk.Much to his\ndiscomfiture, the Major gave him another of those queer looks.His whole\nmanner, and even his appearance, reminded Stephen strangely of Captain\nElijah Brent."Aren\'t you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile\nLibrary Hall?"At that the Major put out his hand impulsively, and gripped Stephen\'s."Well, sir," he said, "I have yet to read a more sensible speech, except\nsome of Abraham Lincoln\'s.Brinsmade gave it to me to read.Whipple,\nthat speech reminded me of Lincoln.Lincoln\'s debate with Judge Douglas at \'Freeport," said\nStephen; beginning to be amused."I admire your frankness, sir," he said."I meant to say that its logic\nrather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln.""I tried to learn what I could from him, Major Sherman."At length the car stopped, and they passed into the Arsenal grounds.Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments, all at last\nin the blue of their country\'s service.Old soldiers with baskets of\ncartridges were stepping from file to file, giving handfuls to the\nrecruits.Many of these thrust them in their pockets, for there were not\nenough belts to go around.The men were standing at ease, and as Stephen\nsaw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned.It was driven away again by Major Sherman\'s vivacious comments.For\nsuddenly Captain Lyon, the man of the hour, came into view.cried the Major, "he\'s a man after my own heart.Just\nlook at him running about with his hair flying in the wind, and the\npapers bulging from his pockets.But\nthis isn\'t the time to be dignified.If there were some like Lyon in\nWashington, our troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time.The gallant Captain was a sight, indeed, and vividly described by Major\nSherman\'s picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment,\nand from company to company, with his sandy hair awry, pointing,\ngesticulating, commanding.In him Stephen recognized the force that had\nswept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith, that snapped the\ntape with which they had tied him.Would he be duped by the Governor\'s ruse of establishing a State Camp at\nthis time?Stephen, as he gazed at him, was sure that he would not.This\nman could see to the bottom, through every specious argument.Little\nmatters of law and precedence did not trouble him.Nor did he believe\nelderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops\nwere there for peace.After the ranks were broken, Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to\nCaptain Lyon and the Union Leader, who was now a Colonel of one of\nthe Volunteer regiments.Stephen sought Richter, who told him that the\nregiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow, prepared to march."We are not consulted, my friend," he said."Will you come into my\nquarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel?"It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship\nwas gone.To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were\nasunder, and he was become an outcast.THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED\n\nThat Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something\nwas to happen.For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension\nwhich comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterday\'s\nincidents at the Arsenal, and leaped out of bed."I think that Lyon is going to attack Camp Jackson to-day," he said to\nhis mother after breakfast, when Hester had left the room."I went down to the Arsenal with the Judge yesterday and saw them\nfinishing the equipment of the new regiments.Any one could see that from the way Lyon was flying about.I think he\nmust have proof that the Camp Jackson people have received supplies from\nthe South."Brice looked fixedly at her son, and then smiled in spite of the\napprehension she felt."Is that why you were working over that map of the city last night?""I was trying to see how Lyon would dispose his troops.I meant to tell\nyou about a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who used\nto be in the army.Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many\nother prominent men here.Louis some months ago to take\nthe position of president of the Fifth Street Line.He is the keenest,\nthe most original man I have ever met.As long as I live I shall never\nforget his description of Lyon.""Is the Major going back into the army?"Brice, Stephen\ndid not remark the little falter in her voice.He laughed over the\nrecollection of the conversation in the street car."Not unless matters in Washington change to suit him," he said."He\nthinks that things have been very badly managed, and does not scruple\nto say so anywhere.I could not have believed it possible that two men\ncould have talked in public as he and Judge Whipple did yesterday and\nnot be shot down.I thought that it was as much as a man\'s life is worth\nto mention allegiance to the Union here in a crowd.Sherman pitched into the Rebels in that car full of people was enough to\nmake your hair stand on end.""He must be a bold man," murmured Mrs."Does he think that the--the Rebellion can be put down?""Not with seventy-five thousand men, nor with ten times that number."Brice sighed, and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief."I am afraid we shall see great misery, Stephen," she said.From that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed\nvery far away.The morning sun poured in through the south windows and\nwas scattered by the silver on the sideboard.From above, on the wall,\nColonel Wilton Brice gazed soberly down.Stephen\'s eyes lighted on the\nportrait, and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to\nply his father with questions about it.Then the picture had suggested\nonly the glory and honor which illumines the page of history.Something\nworthy to look back upon, to keep ones head high.The hatred and the\nsuffering and the tears, the heartrending, tearing apart for all time of\nloving ones who have grown together,--these were not upon that canvas,\nWill war ever be painted with a wart?The sound of feet was heard on the pavement.Stephen rose, glancing at\nhis mother."I am going to the Arsenal," he said.To her, as has been said, was given wisdom beyond most women.She did\nnot try to prevent him as he kissed her good-by.But when the door had\nshut behind him, a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to\nstrain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.His steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag,\nominously quiet at that early hour.At sight of it anger made him hot\nagain.Louis stood at the end of the line, fast\nfilling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of\nthe equipment of the new troops.There was little talk among them, and\nthat little guarded.It was a May morning to rouse a sluggard; the night air tingled into\nlife at the touch of the sunshine, the trees in the flitting glory\nof their first green.Stephen found the shaded street in front of the\nArsenal already filled with an expectant crowd.Sharp commands broke the\nsilence, and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the\nwall.Truly, events were in the air,--great events in which he had no\npart.As he stood leaning against a tree-box by the curb, dragged down once\nmore by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard familiar voices\nclose beside him.Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr.Hopper," he said, "in spite of what you say, I expect you\nare dust as eager as I am to see what is going on.You\'ve taken an early\nstart this morning for sightseeing."Eliphalet\'s equanimity was far from shaken."I don\'t cal\'late to take a great deal of stock in the military," he\nanswered.And a man must keep an eye on what\nis moving."Cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers, and lowered his\nvoice."You\'re right, Hopper," he assented."And if this city is going to be\nUnion, we ought to know it right away."Stephen, listening with growing indignation to this talk, was unaware of\na man who stood on the other side of the tree, and who now came forward\nbefore Mr."My friend," said the stranger, quietly, "I think we have met before,\nwhen your actions were not greatly to your credit.I do not forget a\nface, even when I see it in the dark.Now I hear you utter words which\nare a disgrace to a citizen of the United States.As soon as Stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise, he saw that\nEliphalet had changed countenance.The manner of an important man of\naffairs, which he hay so assiduously cultivated, fell away from him.He\ntook a step backward, and his eyes made an ugly shift.Stephen rejoiced\nto see the stranger turn his back on the manager of Carvel & Company\nbefore that dignitary had time to depart, and stand unconcernedly there\nas if nothing had occurred.He was not a man you would look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a\ngreat El Sol cigar.He wore clothes that were anything but new, a slouch\nhat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots.His trousers were creased at\nthe knees.His head fell forward a little from his square shoulders, and\nleaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively.He had a light brown beard\nthat was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.And yet the very plainness of the man\'s\nappearance only added to his curiosity.His\nwords, his action, too, had been remarkable.The art of administering\na rebuke like that was not given to many men.It was perfectly quiet,\nperfectly final.And then, when it was over, he had turned his back and\ndismissed it.Next Stephen began to wonder what he could know about Hopper.Stephen\nhad suspected Eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain,\nand hence the conversation with Mr.Cluyme had given him no shock in\nthe way of a revelation, But if Hopper were a rogue, ought not Colonel\nCarvel to hear it?Ought not he, Stephen Brice, to ask this man with the\ncigar what he knew, and tell Judge Whipple?The sudden rattle of drums\ngave him a start, and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and\nhatred fast widening between the friends.All this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar, his hand\nagainst the tree-box.A regiment in column came out of the Arsenal gate,\nthe Union leader in his colonel\'s uniform, on horseback at its head.He pulled up in the street opposite to Stephen, and sat in his saddle,\nchatting with other officers around him.Then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up\nto the Colonel\'s horse, He was still smoking.This move, too, was\nsurprising enough, It argued even more assurance."Colonel Blair, my name is Grant," he said briefly.The Colonel faced quickly about, and held out his gloved hand cordially,\n"Captain Ulysses Grant," said he; "of the old army?""I wanted to wish you luck," he said."Thank you, Grant," answered the Colonel."I moved to Illinois after I left here," replied Mr.Grant, as quietly\nas before, "and have been in Galena, in the Leather business there.I\nwent down to Springfield with the company they organized in Galena, to\nbe of any help I could.They made me a clerk in the adjutant general\'s\noffice of the state I ruled blanks, and made out forms for a while."He\npaused, as if to let the humble character of this position sink into\nthe Colonel\'s comprehension."Then they found out that I\'d been\nquartermaster and commissary, and knew something about military orders\nNow I\'m a state mustering officer.I came down to Belleville to muster\nin a regiment, which wasn\'t ready.And so I ran over here to see what\nyou fellows were doing."If this humble account had been delivered volubly, and in another tone,\nit is probable that the citizen-colonel would not have listened, since\nthe events of that day were to crown his work of a winter.Grant\npossessed a manner of holding attention.. It was very evident, however;\nthat Colonel Blair had other things to think of.Nevertheless he said\nkindly:\n\n"Aren\'t you going in, Grant?""I can\'t afford to go in as a captain of volunteers," was the calm\nreply: "I served nine years in the regular army and I think I can\ncommand a regiment."The Colonel, whose attention was called away at that moment, did not\nreply.Some of the younger officers\nwho were there, laughed as they followed his retreating figure.cried one, a lieutenant whom Stephen recognized\nas having been a bookkeeper at Edwards, James, & Doddington\'s, and whose\nstiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly."I guess I\'m about as fit to\ncommand a regiment as Grant is.""That man\'s forty years old, if he\'s a day," put in another."I remember\nwhen he came here to St.He\'d resigned from\nthe army on the Pacific Coast.He put up a log cabin down on the Gravois\nRoad, and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man I ever saw until\nlast year."I spotted him by the El Sol cigar.He used to bring a\nload of wood to the city once in a while, and then he\'d go over to the\nPlanters\' House, or somewhere else, and smoke one of these long fellows,\nand sit against the wall as silent as a wooden Indian.After that he\ncame up to the city without his family and went into real estate one\nwinter.Curious, it is just a year ago this\nmonth than he went over to Illinois.He\'s an honest fellow, and hard\nworking enough, but he don\'t know how.laughed the first, again, as of this in particular\nhad struck his sense of humor."I guess he won\'t get a regiment in a\nhurry, There\'s lots of those military carpet-baggers hanging around for\ngood jobs now.""He might fool you fellows yet," said the one caller, though his tone\nwas not one of conviction."I understand he had a first-rate record an\nthe Mexican War."Just then an aide rode up, and the Colonel gave a sharp command which\nput an end to this desultory talk.As the First Regiment took up\nthe march, the words "Camp Jackson" ran from mouth to mouth on the\nsidewalks.Catching fire, Stephen ran with the crowd, and leaping on\npassing street car, was borne cityward with the drums of the coming\nhosts beating in his ears.In the city, shutters were going up on the stores.The streets were\nfilled with, restless citizens seeking news, and drays were halted here\nand there on the corners, the white eyes and frenzied calls of the <DW64>\ndrivers betraying their excitement.While Stephen related to his mother\nthe events of the morning, Hester burned the dinner.It lay; still\nuntouched, on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the\nfront steps.Sigel\'s regiment had swung into the street, drawing in its\nwake a seething crowd.Three persons came out of the big house next door.One was Anna\nBrinsmade; and there was her father, his white hairs uncovered.His sister was cringing to him appealingly, and he\nstruggling in her grasp.Out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of\na pepperbox revolver."Do you think I can stay here while my\npeople are shot down by a lot of damned Dutchman?"Brinsmade, sternly, "I cannot let you join a mob.I\ncannot let you shoot at men who carry the Union flag.""You cannot prevent me, sir," shouted the young man, in a frenzy."When\nforeigners take our flag for them own, it is time for us to shoot them\ndown."Wrenching himself free, he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of\nthe regiment.Then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and\nwhile these were passing the two stood there as in a dream.After that\nsilence fell upon the street, and Mr.Brinsmade turned and went back\ninto the house, his head bowed as in prayer.Stephen and his mother drew\nback, but Anne saw them."He is a rebel," she faltered.She looked at Stephen appealingly, unashamed of the tears in her eyes."I cannot stay here mother," he said.As he slammed the gate, Anne ran down the steps calling his name.He\npaused, and she caught his sleeve."I knew you would go," she said, "I knew you would go.Oh, Stephen, you\nhave a cool head.But when he reached the corner and\nlooked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to\nmeet his mother.Now and again he was\nstopped by feverish questions, but at length he reached the top of the\nsecond ridge from the river, along which crowded Eighteenth Street now\nruns.Spencer Catherwood had\nbuilt two years before on the outskirts of the town, with the wall at\nthe side, and the brick stable and stable yard.As Stephen approached\nit, the thought came to him how little this world\'s goods avail in times\nof trouble.One of the big Catherwood boys was in the blue marching\nregiment that day, and had been told by his father never again to darken\nhis doors.Another was in Clarence Colfax\'s company of dragoons, and\nstill another had fled southward the night after Sumter.Stephen stopped at the crest of the hill, in the white dust of the\nnew-turned street, to gaze westward.Clouds were gathering in the sky,\nbut the sun still shone brightly, Half way up the rise two blue lines\nhad crawled, followed by black splotches, and at the southwest was the\nglint of the sun on rifle barrels.Directed by a genius in the art of\nwar, the regiments were closing about Camp Jackson.As he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who\nhurried past, a few familiar notes were struck on a piano.They came\nthrough the wide-shuttered window above his head.Then a girl\'s voice\nrose above the notes, in tones that were exultant:--\n\n       "Away down South in de fields of cotton,\n        Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,\n        Look away, look away, Look away, look away.Den I wish I was in Dixie\'s Land,\n        Oh, oh!In Dixie\'s Land I\'ll take my stand,\n        And live and die in Dixie\'s Land.The song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter.Jinny Carvel, how dare you!""We\nshall have a whole regiment of Hessians in here."Old Uncle Ben, the Catherwoods\' coachman, came out of the stable yard.The whites of his eyes were rolling, half in amusement, half in terror.Seeing Stephen standing there, he exclaimed:\n\n"Mistah Brice, if de Dutch take Camp Jackson, is we <DW65>s gwinter be\nfree?"Stephen did not answer, for the piano had started again,\n\n       "If ever I consent to be married,\n        And who could refuse a good mate?The man whom I give my hand to,\n        Must believe in the Rights of the State."Then the blinds were flung aside, and a young lady in\na dress of white trimmed with crimson stood in the window, smiling.For an\ninstant she stared at him, and then turned to the girls crowding behind\nher.What she said, he did not wait to hear.THE TENTH OF MAY\n\nWould the sons of the first families surrender, "Never!"cried a young\nlady who sat behind the blinds in Mrs.It seemed to\nher when she stopped to listen for the first guns of the coming battle\nthat the tumult in her heart would drown their roar."But, Jinny," ventured that Miss Puss Russell who never feared to speak\nher mind, "it would be folly for them to fight.The Dutch and Yankees\noutnumber them ten to one, and they haven\'t any powder and bullets.""And Camp Jackson is down in a hollow," said Maude Catherwood,\ndejectedly.And yet hopefully, too, for at the thought of bloodshed she\nwas near to fainting."Oh," exclaimed Virginia, passionately, "I believe you want them to\nsurrender.I should rather see Clarence dead than giving his sword to a\nYankee."At that the other two were silent again, and sat on through an endless\nafternoon of uncertainty and hope and dread in the darkened room.Catherwood\'s heavy step was heard as he paced the hall.From time to time they glanced at Virginia, as if to fathom her\nthought.She and Puss Russell had come that day to dine with Maude.Catherwood\'s Ben, reeking of the stable, had brought the rumor of the\nmarching on the camp into the dining-room, and close upon the heels of\nthis the rumble of the drums and the passing of Sigel\'s regiment.It was\nVirginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of\nthe troops, and the crowd had cheered her.It was Virginia who flew to\nthe piano to play Dixie ere they could get by, to the awe and admiration\nof the girls and the delight of Mr.Catherwood who applauded her spirit\ndespite the trouble which weighed upon him.Once more the crowd had\ncheered,--and hesitated.But the Dutch regiment slouched on, impassive,\nand the people followed.Virginia remained at the piano, her mood exalted patriotism, uplifted\nin spirit by that grand song.At first she had played it with all her\nmight.She laughed in very scorn of the booby soldiers\nshe had seen.A million of these, with all the firearms in the world,\ncould not prevail against the flower of the South.Then she had begun\nwhimsically to sing a verse of a song she had heard the week before, and\nsuddenly her exaltation was fled, and her fingers left the keys.Gaining\nthe window, trembling, half-expectant, she flung open a blind.The troops, the people, were gone, and there alone in the road\nstood--Stephen Brice.The others close behind her saw him, too, and Puss\ncried out in her surprise.The impression, when the room was dark once\nmore, was of sternness and sadness,--and of strength.Effaced was the\npicture of the plodding recruits with their coarse and ill-fitting\nuniforms of blue.Not a word escaped her, nor could they tell\nwhy--they did not dare to question her then.An hour passed, perhaps\ntwo, before the shrill voice of a boy was heard in the street below.They heard the patter of his bare feet on the pavement, and the cry\nrepeated.Bitter before, now was she on fire.Close her lips as tightly as she might, the tears forced themselves to\nher eyes.How hard it is for us of this age to understand that feeling.The girls gathered around her, pale and frightened and anxious.Suddenly\ncourage returned to her, the courage which made Spartans of Southern\nwomen.Catherwood was on the sidewalk,\ntalking to a breathless man.Barbo, Colonel Carvel\'s\nbook-keeper."Yes," he was saying, "they--they surrendered.There was nothing else\nfor them to do.Catherwood from a kind of stupor."Virginia, we shall make them smart for this yet, My God!"he cried,\n"what have I done that my son should be a traitor, in arms against his\nown brother fighting for his people?To think that a Catherwood should\nbe with the Yankees!You, Ben," he shouted, suddenly perceiving an\nobject for his anger."What do you mean by coming out of the yard?By\nG-d, I\'ll have you whipped.I\'ll show you <DW65>s whether you\'re to be\nfree or not."Catherwood was a good man, who treated his servants well.Suddenly he dropped Virginia\'s hand and ran westward down the hill.Well\nthat she could not see beyond the second rise.Let us stand on the little mound at\nthe northeast of it, on the Olive Street Road, whence Captain Lyon\'s\nartillery commands it.Davis Avenue is\nno longer a fashionable promenade, flashing with bright dresses.Those\nquiet men in blue, who are standing beside the arms of the state troops,\nstacked and surrendered, are United States regulars.They have been in\nKansas, and are used to scenes of this sort.The five Hessian regiments have surrounded the camp.Each commander\nhas obeyed the master mind of his chief, who has calculated the time\nof marching with precision.Here, at the western gate, Colonel Blair\'s\nregiment is in open order.See the prisoners taking their places between\nthe ranks, some smiling, as if to say all is not over yet; some with\nheads hung down, in sulky shame.Still others, who are true to the\nUnion, openly relieved.But who is this officer breaking his sword to\nbits against the fence, rather than surrender it to a Yankee?Listen to\nthe crowd as they cheer him.Listen to the epithets and vile names which\nthey hurl at the stolid blue line of the victors, "Mudsills!""<DW64>\nWorshippers."Yes, the crowd is there, seething with conflicting passions.Men with\nbrows bent and fists clenched, yelling excitedly.Others pushing, and\neager to see,--there in curiosity only.And, alas, women and children\nby the score, as if what they looked upon were not war, but a parade,\na spectacle.As the gray uniforms file out of the gate, the crowd has\nbecome a mob, now flowing back into the fields on each side of the road,\nnow pressing forward vindictively until stopped by the sergeants and\ncorporals.Listen to them calling to sons, and brothers, and husbands in\ngray!See, there is a woman who spits in a soldier\'s face!Throughout it all, the officers sit their horses, unmoved.A man on the\nbank above draws a pistol and aims at a captain.A German private steps\nfrom the ranks, forgetful of discipline, and points at the man, who is\ncursing the captain\'s name.The captain, imperturbable, orders his man\nback to his place.Now are the prisoners of that regiment all in place between the two\nfiles of it.A band (one of those which played lightsome music on the\nbirthday of the camp) is marched around to the head of the column.The\nregiment with its freight moves on to make place for a battalion of\nregulars, amid imprecations and cries of "Hurrah for Jeff Davis!"Stephen Brice stood among the people in Lindell\'s Grove, looking up at\nthe troops on the road, which was on an embankment.Through the rows of\nfaces he had searched in vain for one.His motive he did not attempt\nto fathom--in truth, he was not conscious at the time of any motive.He\nheard the name shouted at the gate."Here they are,--the dragoons!Dismounted, at the head of his\nsmall following, the young Captain walked erect.He did not seem to hear\nthe cheers.His face was set, and he held his gloved hand over the place\nwhere his sword had been, as if over a wound.On his features, in his\nattitude, was stamped the undying determination of the South.How those\nthoroughbreds of the Cavaliers showed it!The\nfire of humiliation burned, but could not destroy their indomitable\nspirit.They were the first of their people in the field, and the last\nto leave it.Historians may say that the classes of the South caused the\nwar; they cannot say that they did not take upon themselves the greatest\nburden of the suffering.Twice that day was the future revealed to Stephen.Once as he stood\non the hill-crest, when he had seen a girl in crimson and white in\na window,--in her face.And now again he read it in the face of her\ncousin.It was as if he had seen unrolled the years of suffering that\nwere to come.In that moment of deep bitterness his reason wavered.Surely there was no such feeling in the North as these\npeople betrayed.That most dangerous of gifts, the seeing of two\nsides of a quarrel, had been given him.He\nsympathized with the Southern people.They had befriended him in his\npoverty.Why had he not been born, like Clarence Colfax, the owner of a\nlarge plantation, the believer in the divine right of his race to rule?Would that his path had been as\nstraight, his duty as easy, as that of the handsome young Captain.Presently these thoughts were distracted by the sight of a back\nstrangely familiar.The back belonged to a gentleman who was\nenergetically climbing the embankment in front of him, on the top\nof which Major Sexton, a regular, army officer, sat his horse.The\ngentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand, and held a\nnewspaper tightly rolled in the other.Stephen smiled to himself when it\ncame over him that this gentleman was none other than that Mr.William\nT. Sherman he had met in the street car the day before.Somehow Stephen\nwas fascinated by the decision and energy of Mr.He gave Major Saxton a salute, quick and genial.Then, almost\nwith one motion he unrolled the newspaper, pointed to a paragraph, and\nhanded it to the officer.Major Saxton was still reading when a drunken\nruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through\nthe lines.Sherman slid down the\nbank with his boy into the grove beside Stephen.A corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank, and\nhe rolled at Mr.With a curse, he picked himself up,\nfumbling in his pocket.There was a flash, and as the smoke rolled from\nbefore his eyes, Stephen saw a man of a German regiment stagger and\nfall.It was the signal for a rattle of shots.Stones and bricks filled the\nair, and were heard striking steel and flesh in the ranks.The regiment\nquivered,--then halted at the loud command of the officers, and the\nranks faced out with level guns, Stephen reached for Mr.Sherman\'s boy,\nbut a gentleman had already thrown him and was covering his body.He contrived to throw down a woman standing beside him before the\nmini-balls swished over their heads, and the leaves and branches began\nto fall.Between the popping of the shots sounded the shrieks of wounded\nwomen and children, the groans and curses of men, and the stampeding of\nhundreds.He was about to obey when a young; man, small and agile, ran past him\nfrom behind, heedless of the panic.Stopping at the foot of the bank he\ndropped on one knee, resting his revolver in the hollow of his left\narm.At the same time two of the soldiers above\nlowered their barrels to cover him.When it\nrolled away, Brinsmade lay on the ground.He staggered to his feet with\nan oath, and confronted a young man who was hatless, and upon whose\nforehead was burned a black powder mark.he cried, reaching out wildly, "curse you, you d--d Yankee.Maddened, he made a rush at Stephen\'s throat.But Stephen seized his\nhands and bent them down, and held them firmly while he kicked and\nstruggled.he panted; "curse you, you let me go and I\'ll kill\nyou,--you Yankee upstart!"One of the\nofficers, seeing the struggle, started down the bank, was reviled, and\nhesitated."Let him go, Brice," he said, in a tone of command.Whereupon Brinsmade made a dash for his pistol on the ground."Now see here, Jack," he said, picking it up, "I don\'t want to shoot\nyou, but I may have to.That young man saved your life at the risk of\nhis own.If that fool Dutchman had had a ball in his gun instead of a\nwad, Mr.Brinsmade took one long look at Stephen,\nturned on his heel, and walked off rapidly through the grove.And it may\nbe added that for some years after he was not seen in St.For a moment the other two stood staring after him.Sherman\ntook his boy by the hand.Brice," he said, "I\'ve seen a few things done in my life, but\nnothing better than this.Perhaps the day may come when you and I may\nmeet in the army.They don\'t seem to think much of us now," he added,\nsmiling, "but we may be of use to \'em later.If ever I can serve you,\nMr.Brice, I beg you to call on me."Sherman, nodding his head\nvigorously, went away southward through the grove, toward Market Street.The dead were being laid in carriages, and the\nwounded tended by such physicians as chanced to be on the spot.Stephen,\ndazed at what had happened, took up the march to town.He strode faster\nthan the regiments with their load of prisoners, and presently he found\nhimself abreast the little file of dragoons who were guarded by some of\nBlair\'s men.It was then that he discovered that the prisoners\' band in\nfront was playing "Dixie."They are climbing the second hill, and are coming now to the fringe\nof new residences which the rich citizens have built.In the windows and on the steps of others women are\ncrying or waving handkerchiefs and calling out to the prisoners, some\nof whom are gay, and others sullen.A distracted father tries to break\nthrough the ranks and rescue his son.Ah, here is the Catherwood house.Catherwood, with her hand on her husband\'s arm, with\nred eyes, is scanning those faces for the sight of George.Will the Yankees murder him for treason,\nor send him North to languish the rest of his life?James has,\nacross the street, and is even now being carried into the house.Few\nof us can see into the hearts of those women that day, and speak of the\nsuffering there.His face is cast down as\nhe passes the house from which he is banished.Nor do father, or mother,\nor sister in their agony make any sound or sign.The\nwelcome and the mourning and the tears are all for him.The band is playing "Dixie" once more.George is coming, and some one\nelse.The girls are standing in a knot bend the old people, dry-eyed,\ntheir handkerchiefs in their hands.Some of the prisoners take off their\nhats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown\nhair, who wears the red and white of the South as if she were born to\nthem.Ah, at last she sees him, walking erect\nat the head of his dragoons.He gives her one look of entreaty, and that\nsmile which should have won her heart long ago.As if by common consent\nthe heads of the troopers are uncovered before her.How bravely she\nwaves at them until they are gone down the street!Then only do her eyes\nfill with tears, and she passes into the house.Had she waited, she might have seen a solitary figure leaving the line\nof march and striding across to Pine Street.That night the sluices of the heavens were opened, and the blood was\nwashed from the grass in Lindell Grove.The rain descended in floods\non the distracted city, and the great river rose and flung brush from\nMinnesota forests high up on the stones of the levee.Down in the long\nbarracks weary recruits, who had stood and marched all the day long,\nwent supperless to their hard pallets.Many a boy, prisoner or volunteer, sobbed\nhimself to sleep in the darkness.All were prisoners alike, prisoners\nof war.Sobbed themselves to sleep, to dream of the dear homes that were\nhere within sight and sound of them, and to which they were powerless to\ngo.Sisters, and mothers, and wives were there, beyond the rain, holding\nout arms to them.But what of\nthe long nights when husband and wife have lain side by side?What of\nthe children who ask piteously where their father is going, and who are\ngathered by a sobbing mother to her breast?Where is the picture of that\nlast breakfast at home?So in the midst of the cheer which is saddest in\nlife comes the thought that, just one year ago, he who is the staff\nof the house was wont to sit down just so merrily to his morning meal,\nbefore going to work in the office.Why had they not thanked God on\ntheir knees for peace while they had it?See the brave little wife waiting on the porch of her home for him to go\nby.The sun shines, and the grass is green on the little plot, and the\ngeraniums red.Last spring she was sewing here with a song on her lips,\nwatching for him to turn the corner as he came back to dinner.Her good\nneighbors, the doctor and his wife, come in at the little gate to cheer\nher.Why does God mock her with sunlight and\nwith friends?And that is his dear face, the second from the end.Look, he is smiling bravely, as if to say a thousand\ntender things."Will, are the flannels in your knapsack?You have not\nforgotten that medicine for your cough?"What courage sublime is that\nwhich lets her wave at him?Well for you, little woman, that you cannot\nsee the faces of the good doctor and his wife behind you.Oh, those guns\nof Sumter, how they roar in your head!Ay, and will roar again, through\nforty years of widowhood!Brice was in the little parlor that Friday night, listening to the\ncry of the rain outside.Why\nshould she be happy, and other mothers miserable?The day of reckoning\nfor her happiness must surely come, when she must kiss Stephen a brave\nfarewell and give him to his country.For the sins of the fathers are\nvisited on the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them\nthat hate Him who is the Ruler of all things.The bell rang, and Stephen went to the door.That gentleman was suddenly aged, and his clothes were wet\nand spattered with mud.He sank into a chair, but refused the spirits\nand water which Mrs."Stephen," he said, "I have been searching the city for John.Did you\nsee him at Camp Jackson--was he hurt?""I think not, sir," Stephen answered, with clear eyes."I saw him walking southward after the firing was all over.""If you will excuse me,\nmadam, I shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter.I have been able to\nfind no one who saw him."As he went out he glanced at Stephen\'s forehead.But for once in his\nlife, Mr.Brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of\nanother."Stephen, you did not tell me that you saw John," said his mother, when\nthe door was closed.IN THE ARSENAL\n\nThere was a dismal tea at Colonel Carvel\'s house in Locust Street that\nevening Virginia did not touch a mouthful, and the Colonel merely made a\npretence of eating.Addison Colfax had driven in\nfrom Bellegarde, nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash\nthe foam from her panting horses.She did not wait for Jackson to come\nout with an umbrella, but rushed through the wet from the carriage\nto the door in her haste to urge the Colonel to go to the Arsenal and\ndemand Clarence\'s release.Carvel assured her\nit would do no good, in vain that he told her of a more important matter\nthat claimed him.Could there be a more important matter than his\nown nephew kept in durance, and in danger of being murdered by Dutch\nbutchers in the frenzy of their victory?Colfax shut herself up in\nher room, and through the door Virginia heard her sobs as she went down\nto tea.The Colonel made no secret of his uneasiness.With his hat on his head,\nand his hands in his pockets, he paced up and down the room.He let his\ncigar go out,--a more serious sign still.Finally he stood with his face\nto the black window, against which the big drops were beating in a fury.Virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table, still in that gown\nof white and crimson, which she had worn in honor of the defenders of\nthe state.Expressionless, save for a glance of solicitation at her\nfather\'s back.If resolve were feminine, Virginia might have sat for\nthat portrait.There was a light in her dark blue eyes.Underneath there\nwere traces of the day\'s fatigue.When she spoke, there was little life\nin her voice."Aren\'t you going to the Planters\' House, Pa The Colonel turned, and\ntried to smile."I reckon not to-night, Jinny."To find out what they are going to do with Clarence," she said\nindignantly."I reckon they don\'t know at the Planters\' House," he said."Then--" began Virginia, and stopped."Then why not go to the Barracks?Order the carriage, and I will go with\nyou."He stood looking down at her fixedly, as was sometimes\nhis habit."Jinny," he said slowly, "Jinny, do you mean to marry Clarence?"The suddenness of the question took her breath.But she answered\nsteadily:\n\n"Yes."Still he stood, and it seemed to her that her father\'s gaze pierced to\nher secret soul."Come here, my dear," he said.He held out his arms, and she fluttered into them.It was not the first time she had cried out her troubles\nagainst that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge.From\nchildhood she had been comforted there.Had she broken her doll, had\nMammy Easter been cross, had lessons gone wrong at school, was she\nill, or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is woman\'s inevitable\nlot,--this was her sanctuary.This burden God Himself had sent,\nand none save her Heavenly Father might cure it.Through his great love\nfor her it was given to Colonel Carvel to divine it--only vaguely.Many times he strove to speak, and could not.But presently, as if\nashamed of her tears, she drew back from him and took her old seat on\nthe arm of his chair.By the light of his intuition, the Colonel chose tins words well.What\nhe had to speak of was another sorrow, yet a healing one."You must not think of marriage now, my dear, when the bread we eat may\nfail us.Jinny, we are not as rich as we used to be.Our trade was\nin the South and West, and now the South and West cannot pay.Hopper yesterday, and he tells me that we must be\nprepared.""And did you think I would care, dear?""I can bear\nwith poverty and rags, to win this war.""His own eyes were dim, but pride shone in them.Jackson came in on\ntiptoe, and hesitated.At the Colonel\'s motion he took away the china\nand the silver, and removed the white cloth, and turned low the lights\nin the chandelier.He went out softly, and closed the door."Pa," said Virginia, presently, "do you trust Mr.He improved the business greatly before this trouble\ncame.And even now we are not in such straits as some other houses.""Eliphalet Hopper will serve you so long as\nhe serves himself."I think you do him an injustice, my dear," answered the Colonel.But\nuneasiness was in his voice."Hopper is hard working, scrupulous to a\ncent.He owns two slaves now who are running the river.He keeps out of\npolitics, and he has none of the Yankee faults."Getting up, he went over to the\nbell-cord at the door and pulled it."To Jefferson City, dear, to see the Governor.He smiled, and stooped to kiss her."Yes," he answered, "in the rain as far as the depot, I can trust\nyou, Jinny.And Lige\'s boat will be back from New Orleans to-morrow or\nSunday."The next morning the city awoke benumbed, her heart beating but feebly.A long line of boats lay idle,\nwith noses to the levee.Men stood on the street corners in the rain,\nreading of the capture of Camp Jackson, and of the riot, and thousands\nlifted up their voices to execrate the Foreign City below Market Street.A vague terror, maliciously born, subtly spread.The Dutch had broken\nup the camp, a peaceable state institution, they had shot down innocent\nwomen and children.What might they not do to the defenceless city under\ntheir victorious hand, whose citizens were nobly loyal to the South?Ladies who ventured out that day\ncrossed the street to avoid Union gentlemen of their acquaintance.It was early when Mammy Easter brought the news paper to her mistress.Virginia read the news, and ran joyfully to her aunt\'s room.Three times\nshe knocked, and then she heard a cry within.Then the key was turned\nand the bolt cautiously withdrawn, and a crack of six inches disclosed\nher aunt."Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!""I thought it was the\nDutch coming to murder us all, What have they done to Clarence?""We shall see him to-day, Aunt Lillian," was the joyful answer."The\nnewspaper says that all the Camp Jackson prisoners are to be set free\nto-day, on parole.Oh, I knew they would not dare to hold them.The\nwhole state would have risen to their rescue."Colfax did not receive these tidings with transports.She permitted\nher niece to come into her room, and then: sank into a chair before the\nmirror of her dressing-table, and scanned her face there."I could not sleep a wink, Jinny, all night long.I\nam afraid I am going to have another of my attacks."I\'ll get it for you," said Virginia, used to her aunt\'s vagaries."It says that they will be paroled to-day, and that they passed a\ncomfortable night.""It must be a Yankee lie," said the lady.I saw them\ntorturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians!I know he had to sleep\non a dirty floor with low-down trash.""But we shall have him here to-night, Aunt Lillian!""Mammy, tell Uncle Ben that Mr."Has he gone down to see\nClarence?""He went to Jefferson City last night," replied Virginia.Colfax exclaimed in horror at this news."Do you mean that he has deserted us?""That he has left us\nhere defenceless,--at the mercy of the Dutch, that they may wreak their\nvengeance upon us women?If I were your\nage and able to drag myself to the street, I should be at the Arsenal\nnow.I should be on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even\nif he is a Yankee.""I do not go on my knees to any man," she said."Rosetta, tell Ned I\nwish the carriage at once."Her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm."Your Pa would never forgive\nme if anything happened to you."A smile, half pity, crossed the girl\'s anxious face."I am afraid that I must risk adding to your misfortune, Aunt Lillian,"\nshe said, and left the room.His was one of the Union houses which\nshe might visit and not lose her self respect.Like many Southerners,\nwhen it became a question of go or stay, Mr.Brinsmade\'s unfaltering\nlove for the Union had kept him in.Bell, and later\nhad presided at Crittenden Compromise meetings.In short, as a man of\npeace, he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace.And now\nthat it was to be war, and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with\nthe Union, the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could\nnot bring themselves to regard him as an enemy.He never hurt their\nfeelings; and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work\nwhich has been done by self-denying Christians of all ages,--the relief\nof suffering.He visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless, and\nmany a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying, Yankee and\nRebel alike, and wrote their last letters home.And Yankee and Rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of\nperplexity or trouble, rather than hotheaded advice from their own\nleaders.Brinsmade\'s own carriage was drawn up at his door; and that\ngentleman himself standing on the threshold.He came down his steps\nbareheaded in the wet to hand Virginia from her carriage.Courteous and kind as ever, he asked for her father and her aunt as\nhe led her into the house.However such men may try to hide their own\ntrials under a cheerful mien, they do not succeed with spirits of a\nkindred nature.With the others, who are less generous, it matters\nnot.Virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not\nperceive that a trouble had come to this good man.Absorbed as she was\nin her own affairs, she forgot some of them in his presence.The fire\nleft her tongue, and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of\nan enemy.Such was her state of mind, when she was led into the\ndrawing-room.From the corner of it Anne arose and came forward to throw\nher arms around her friend."Jinny, it was so good of you to come."Because we are Union," said honest Anne, wishing to have no shadow of\ndoubt."Anne," she cried, "if you were German, I believe\nI should love you."I should not have dared go to your house,\nbecause I know that you feel so deeply."That Jack has run away--has gone South, we think.Perhaps," she cried,\n"perhaps he may be dead."She drew Anne to the sofa and\nkissed her."No, he is not dead," she said gently, but with a confidence in her\nvoice of rare quality."He is not dead, Anne dear, or you would have\nheard."Had she glanced up, she would have seen Mr.He\nlooked kindly at all people, but this expression he reserved for those\nwhom he honored.A life of service to others had made him guess that,\nin the absence of her father, this girl had come to him for help of some\nkind."Virginia is right, Anne," he said."John has gone to fight for his\nprinciples, as every gentleman who is free should; we must remember\nthat this is his home, and that we must not quarrel with him, because\nwe think differently.""There is\nsomething I can do for you, my dear?"And yet her honesty was as\ngreat as Anne\'s.She would not have it thought that she came for other\nreasons."My aunt is in such a state of worry over Clarence that I came\nto ask you if you thought the news true, that the prisoners are to be\nparoled.She thinks it is a--" Virginia flushed, and bit a rebellious\ntongue.Brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made.He\nunderstood the girl, and admired her."I\'ll drive to the Arsenal with you, Jinny," he answered."I know\nCaptain Lyon, and we shall find out certainly.""You will do nothing of the kind, sir," said Virginia, with emphasis."Had I known this--about John, I should not have come."What a gentleman of the old school\nhe was, with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye\nkindling with charity."My dear," he answered, "Nicodemus is waiting.I was just going myself\nto ask Captain Lyon about John."Virginia\'s further objections were cut\nshort by the violent clanging of the door-bell, and the entrance of a\ntall, energetic gentleman, whom Virginia had introduced to her as\nMajor Sherman, late of the army, and now president of the Fifth Street\nRailroad.He then proceeded, as was\nevidently his habit, directly to the business on which he was come.Brinsmade," he said, "I heard, accidentally, half an hour ago that\nyou were seeking news of your son.I regret to say, sir, that the news I\nhave will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts.But in justice to\na young gentleman of this city I think I ought to tell you what happened\nat Camp Jackson."With\nsome gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story,\nhe gave a most terse and vivid account of Mr.John\'s arrival at the\nembankment by the grove--of his charging a whole regiment of Union\nvolunteers.Sherman did not believe in\nmincing matters even to a father and sister."And, sir," said he, "you may thank the young man who lives next door to\nyou--Mr.Brice, I believe--for saving your son\'s life."Virginia felt Anne\'s hand tighten But her own was limp.A hot wave swept\nover her, Was she never to hear the end of this man."Yes, sir, Stephen Brice," answered Mr."And I never in my life\nsaw a finer thing done, in the Mexican War or out of it.""As sure as I know you," said the Major, with excessive conviction.Brinsmade, "I was in there last night, I knew the young\nman had been at the camp.He told me\nthat he had, by the embankment.But he never mentioned a word about\nsaving his life.""By glory, but he\'s even better than I\nthought him, Did you see a black powder mark on his face?""Why, yes, sir, I saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead.""Well, sir, if one of the Dutchmen who shot at Jack had known enough to\nput a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr.Brice, who was only\nten feet away, standing before your son."Anne gave a little cry--Virginia was silent--Her lips were parted.Though she realized it not, she was thirsting %a hear the whole of the\nstory.The Major told it, soldier fashion, but well.Sherman) had seen Brice throw the woman down and\nhad cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the\nregiment, and how men and women were falling all about them; and how\nStephen had flung Jack and covered him with his body.Had she any right to treat\nsuch a man with contempt?She remembered hour he had looked, at her when\nhe stood on the corner by the Catherwoods\' house.And, worst of all, she\nremembered many spiteful remarks she had made, even to Anne, the gist of\nwhich had been that Mr.Brice was better at preaching than at fighting.She knew now--and she had known in her heart before--that this was the\ngreatest injustice she could have done him.It was Anne who tremblingly asked the Major.Sherman,\napparently, was not the man to say that Jack would have shot Stephen had\nhe not interfered.John would have\nshot the man who saved his life.Brinsmade and Anne had\ngone upstairs to the sickbed, these were the tidings the Major told\nVirginia, who kept it in her heart.The reason he told her was because\nshe had guessed a part of it.Brinsmade drove to the Arsenal with her that Saturday,\nin his own carriage.Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to\nhim to talk cheerily with her.He told her many little anecdotes of his\ntravel, but not one of them did she hear.Again, at the moment when she\nthought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she\nfound herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter\nyoung Bostonian.In spite of herself she had to admit that Stephen\'s\ndeed was splendid.Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy.But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would\nClarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr.Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr.As if to aggravate her torture, Mr.Brinsmade\'s talk drifted to the\nsubject of young Mr.He told her of the\nbrave struggle Stephen had made, and how he had earned luxuries, and\noften necessities, for his mother by writing for the newspapers.Brinsmade, "often I have been unable to sleep, and\nhave seen the light in Stephen\'s room until the small hours of the\nmorning.""Can\'t you tell me something bad\nabout him?The good gentleman started, and looked searchingly at the girl by his\nside, flushed and confused.Perhaps he thought--but how can we tell what\nhe thought?How can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after\nthey have caned us for them?We do not remember that our parents have\nonce been young themselves, and that some word or look of our own brings\na part of their past vividly before them.Brinsmade was silent, but\nhe looked out of the carriage window, away from Virginia.And presently,\nas they splashed through the mud near the Arsenal, they met a knot of\ngentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city.Nicodemus stopped\nat his master\'s signal.Here was George Catherwood, and his father was\nwith him."They have released us on parole," said George."Yes, we had a fearful\nnight of it.They could not have kept us--they had no quarters."How changed he was from the gay trooper of yesterday!His bright uniform\nwas creased and soiled and muddy, his face unshaven, and dark rings of\nweariness under his eyes."Do you know if Clarence Colfax has gone home?""Clarence is an idiot," cried George, ill-naturedly.Brinsmade, of\nall the prisoners here, he refused to take the parole, or the oath of\nallegiance.He swears he will remain a prisoner until he is exchanged.""The young man is Quixotic," declared the elder Catherwood, who was not\nhimself in the best of humors.Brinsmade, with as much severity as he was ever known\nto use, "sir, I honor that young man for this more than I can tell you.Nicodemus, you may drive on."Perhaps George had caught sight of a face in the depths of the carriage,\nfor he turned purple, and stood staring on the pavement after his\ncholeric parent had gone on.Of all the thousand and more young men who had upheld\nthe honor of their state that week, there was but the one who chose to\nremain in durance vile within the Arsenal wall--Captain Clarence Colfax,\nlate of the Dragoons.Brinsmade was rapidly admitted to the Arsenal, and treated with the\nrespect which his long service to the city deserved.He and Virginia\nwere shown into the bare military room of the commanding officer, and\nthither presently came Captain Lyon himself.Virginia tingled with\nantagonism when she saw this man who had made the city tremble, who had\nset an iron heel on the flaming brand of her Cause.He, too, showed the\nmarks of his Herculean labors, but only on his clothes and person.His\nlong red hair was unbrushed, his boots covered with black mud, and his\ncoat unbuttoned.His face was ruddy, and his eye as clear as though\nhe had arisen from twelve hours\' sleep.He bowed to Virginia (not too\npolitely, to be sure).Her own nod of are recognition did not seem to\ntrouble him."Yes, sir," he said incisively, in response to Mr.Brinsmade\'s question,\n"we are forced to retain Captain Colfax.He prefers to remain a prisoner\nuntil he is exchanged.He refuses to take the oath of allegiance to the\nUnited States."And why should he be made to, Captain Lyon?In what way has he opposed\nthe United States troops?""You will pardon me, Miss Carvel," said Captain Lyon, gravely, "if I\nrefuse to discuss that question with you."Colfax is a near relative of yours, Miss Carvel,"\nthe Captain continued."His friends may come here to see him during\nthe day.And I believe it is not out of place for me to express my\nadmiration of the captain\'s conduct.You may care to see him now--"\n\n"Thank you," said Virginia, curtly."Orderly, my respects to Captain Colfax, and ask him if a he will be\nkind enough to come in here.Brinsmade," said the Captain, "I\nshould like a few words with you, sir."And so, thanks to the Captain\'s\ndelicacy, when Clarence arrived he found Virginia alone.She was much\nagitated She ran toward him as he entered the door, calling his name."Max, you are going to stay here?"Aglow with admiration, she threw herself into his arms.Now, indeed, was\nshe proud of him.Of all the thousand defenders of the state, he alone\nwas true to his principles--to the South.Within sight of home, he alone\nhad chosen privation.She looked up into his face, which showed marks of excitement and\nfatigue.She knew that he could live on\nexcitement.The thought came to her--was it that which sustained him\nnow?Surely the touch of this experience\nwould transform the boy into the man.This was the weak point in the\narmor which she wore so bravely for her cousin.He had known neither care nor\nresponsibility.His one longing from a child had been that love of\nfighting and adventure which is born in the race.Until this gloomy\nday in the Arsenal, Virginia had never characterized it as a love of\nexcitement---as any thing which contained a selfish element.She looked\nup into his face, I say, and saw that which it is given to a woman only\nto see.His eyes burned with a light that was far away.Even with his\narms around her he seemed to have forgotten her presence, and that she\nhad come all the way to the Arsenal to see him.Her hands dropped limply\nfrom his shoulders She drew away, as he did not seem to notice.Above and beyond the sacrifice of a woman\'s life, the\njoy of possessing her soul and affection, is something more desirable\nstill--fame and glory--personal fame and glory, The woman may share\nthem, of course, and be content with the radiance.When the Governor\nin making his inauguration speech, does he always think of the help the\nlittle wife has given him.And so, in moments of excitement, when we see\nfar ahead into a glorious future, we do not feel the arms about us,\nor value the sweets which, in more humdrum days, we labored so hard to\nattain.Virginia drew away, and the one searching glance she gave him he did\nnot see.He was staring far beyond; tears started in her eyes, and she\nturned from him to look out over the Arsenal grounds, still wet and\nheavy with the night\'s storm.She\nthought of the supper cooking at home.And yet, in that moment of bitterness Virginia loved him.Such are the\nways of women, even of the proudest, who love their country too.It was\nbut right that he should not think of her when the honor of the South\nwas at stake; and the anger that rose within her was against those nine\nhundred and ninety-nine who had weakly accepted the parole."He has gone to Jefferson City, to see the Governor.."\n\n"And you came alone?"What a relief that should have come\namong the first.She was\nafraid," (Virginia had to smile), "she was afraid the Yankees would kill\nyou.""They have behaved very well for Yankees," replied he, "No luxury, and\nthey will not hear of my having a servant.They are used to doing their\nown work.But they have treated me much better since I refused to take\ntheir abominable oath.""And you will be honored for it when the news reaches town."Clarence asked eagerly, "I reckon they will\nthink me a fool!""I should like to hear any one say so," she flashed out."No," said Virginia, "our friends will force them to release you.But you have done nothing to be imprisoned\nfor.""I do not want to be\nreleased.""You do not want to be released," she repeated.If I remain a prisoner, it will\nhave a greater effect--for the South."She smiled again, this time at the boyish touch of heroics.Experience,\nresponsibility, and he would get over that.She remembered once, long\nago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and\nhe had tortured her by remaining there for two whole days.It was well on in the afternoon when she drove back to the city with Mr.Neither of them had eaten since morning, nor had they even\nthought of hunger.Brinsmade was silent, leaning back in the corner\nof the carriage, and Virginia absorbed in her own thoughts.Drawing near\nthe city, that dreaded sound, the rumble of drums, roused them.A shot\nrang out, and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses.As they dashed across Walnut at Seventh came the fusillade.Down the vista of the street was a mass of\nblue uniforms, and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of\nthe old Presbyterian Church Mr.Brinsmade quietly drew her back into the\ncarriage.The shots ceased, giving place to an angry roar that struck terror to\nher heart that wet and lowering afternoon.Nicodemus tugging at the reins, and great splotches of\nmud flying in at the windows.The roar of the crowd died to an ominous\nmoaning behind them.Brinsmade was speaking:--\n"From battle and murder, and from sudden death--from all sedition, privy\nconspiracy, and rebellion,--Good Lord, deliver us."He was repeating the Litany--that Litany which had come down through the\nages.They had chanted it in Cromwell\'s time, when homes were ruined and\nlaid waste, and innocents slaughtered.They had chanted it on the dark,\nbarricaded stairways of mediaeval Paris, through St.Bartholomew\'s\nnight, when the narrow and twisted streets, ran with blood.They had\nchanted it in ancient India, and now it was heard again in the New World\nand the New Republic of Peace and Good Will.The girl flinched at the word which the good gentleman had\nuttered in his prayers.Was she a traitor to that flag for which her\npeople had fought in three wars?She burned to blot it\nforever from the book Oh, the bitterness of that day, which was prophecy\nof the bitterness to come.Brinsmade escorted her up her own steps.He held her hand a little at parting, and bade her be of good cheer.Perhaps he guessed something of the trial she was to go through that\nnight alone with her aunt, Clarence\'s mother.Brinsmade did not go\ndirectly home.He went first to the little house next door to his.Brice and Judge Whipple were in the parlor: What passed between them\nthere has not been told, but presently the Judge and Mr.Brinsmade came\nout together and stood along time in, the yard, conversing, heedless of\nthe rain.THE STAMPEDE\n\nSunday dawned, and the people flocked to the churches.But even in the\nhouse of God were dissension and strife.Posthelwaite\'s Virginia saw men and women rise from their knees and\nwalk out--their faces pale with anger.Mark\'s the prayer for\nthe President of the United States was omitted.Catherwood nodded approvingly over the sermon in which the South was\njustified, and the sanction of Holy Writ laid upon her Institution.With not indifferent elation these gentlemen watched the departure of\nbrethren with whom they had labored for many years, save only when Mr.Brinsmade walked down the aisle never to return.So it is that war, like\na devastating flood, creeps insistent into the most sacred places, and\nwill not be denied.Davitt, at least, preached that day to an united\ncongregation,--which is to say that none of them went out.Hopper,\nwho now shared a pew with Miss Crane, listened as usual with a most\nreverent attention.The clouds were low and the streets wet as people\nwalked home to dinner, to discuss, many in passion and some in sorrow,\nthe doings of the morning.A certain clergyman had prayed to be\ndelivered from the Irish, the Dutch, and the Devil.Was it he who\nstarted the old rumor which made such havoc that afternoon?Those\nbarbarians of the foreign city to the south, drunk with power, were to\nsack and loot the city.How it flew across street and alley, from\nyard to yard, and from house to house!Privileged Ned ran into the\ndining-room where Virginia and her aunt were sitting, his eyes rolling\nand his face ashen with terror, crying out that the Dutch were marching\non the city, firebrands in hand and murder in their hearts."De Gen\'ral done gib out er procl\'mation, Miss Jinny," he cried."De\nGen\'ral done say in dat procl\'mation dat he ain\'t got no control ober de\nDutch soldiers.""Oh Miss Jinny, ain\'t you gwineter Glencoe?Ain\'t you gwineter flee\naway?Every fambly on dis here street\'s gwine away--is packin\' up fo\' de\ncountry.Doan\'t you hear \'em, Miss Jinny?What\'ll your pa say to Ned of\nhe ain\'t make you clear out!Doan\'t you hear de carridges a-rattlin\' off\nto de country?"Virginia rose in agitation, yet trying to be calm, and to remember\nthat the safety of the household depended upon her alone.That was her\nthought,--bred into her by generations,--the safety of the household,\nof the humblest slave whose happiness and welfare depended upon her\nfather\'s bounty.How she longed in that instant for her father or\nCaptain Lige, for some man\'s strength, to depend upon.She has seen her aunt swoon before,\nand her maid Susan knows well what to do."Laws Mussy, no, Miss Jinny.One <DW65> laik me doan\'t make no\ndifference.My Marsa he say: \'Whaffor you leave ma house to be ramsacked\nby de Dutch?\'Oh Miss Jinny, you an\' Miss Lill an\' Mammy\nEaster an\' Susan\'s gwine with Jackson, an\' de othah niggahs can walk.Ephum an\' me\'ll jes\' put up de shutters an\' load de Colonel\'s gun."By this time the room was filled with excited <DW64>s, some crying,\nand some laughing hysterically.Uncle Ben had come in from the kitchen;\nJackson was there, and the women were a wailing bunch in the corner by\nthe sideboard.Old Ephum, impassive, and Ned stood together.Virginia\'s\neye rested upon them, and the light of love and affection was in it.Yes, carriages were indeed rattling outside, though\na sharp shower was falling.Across the street Alphonse, M. Renault\'s\nbutler, was depositing bags and bundles on the steps.M. Renault himself\nbustled out into the rain, gesticulating excitedly.Spying her at the\nwindow, he put his hands to his mouth, cried out something, and ran in\nagain.Virginia flung open the sash and listened for the dreaded sound\nof drums.Then she crossed quickly over to where her aunt was lying on\nthe lounge."O Jinny," murmured that lady, who had revived, "can\'t you do something?They will be here any moment to burn us, to\nmurder us--to--oh, my poor boy!Why isn\'t he here to protect his mother!Why was Comyn so senseless, so thoughtless, as to leave us at such a\ntime!""I don\'t think there is any need to be frightened," said Virginia, with\na calmness that made her aunt tremble with anger."It is probably only a\nrumor.Brinsmade\'s and ask him about it."However loath to go, Ned departed at once.All honor to those old-time\n<DW64>s who are now memories, whose devotion to their masters was next\nto their love of God.A great fear was in Ned\'s heart, but he went.And he believed devoutly that he would never see his young mistress any\nmore.Colfax is summoning\nthat courage which comes to persons of her character at such times.She\ngathers her jewels into a bag, and her fine dresses into her trunk,\nwith trembling hands, although she is well enough now.The picture of\nClarence in the diamond frame she puts inside the waist of her gown.No,\nshe will not go to Bellegarde.With frantic\nhaste she closes the trunk, which Ephum and Jackson carry downstairs and\nplace between the seats of the carriage.Ned had had the horses in it\nsince church time.It is three in the afternoon, and Jackson explains that,\nwith the load, they would not reach there until midnight, if at all.Yes; many of the first families live there,\nand would take them in for the night.Equipages of all sorts are\npassing,--private carriages and public, and corner-stand hacks.The\nblack drivers are cracking whips over galloping horses.Pedestrians are hurrying by with bundles under their arms, some running\neast, and some west, and some stopping to discuss excitedly the chances\nof each direction.From the river comes the hoarse whistle of the boats\nbreaking the Sabbath stillness there.Virginia leaned against the iron railing of the steps, watching the\nscene, and waiting for Ned to return from Mr.Her face was\ntroubled, as well it might be.The most alarming reports were cried up\nto her from the street, and she looked every moment for the black smoke\nof destruction to appear to the southward.Around her were gathered the\nCarvel servants, most of them crying, and imploring her not to leave\nthem.Colfax\'s trunk was brought down and placed in the\ncarriage where three of them might have ridden to safety, a groan of\ndespair and entreaty rose from the faithful group that went to her\nheart."Miss Jinny, you ain\'t gwineter leave yo\' ol mammy?""Hush, Mammy," she said."No, you shall all go, if I have to stay\nmyself.Ephum, go to the livery stable and get another carriage."She went up into her own deserted room to gather the few things she\nwould take with her--the little jewellery case with the necklace of\npearls which her great-grandmother had worn at her wedding.Rosetta and\nMammy Easter were of no use, and she had sent them downstairs again.With a flutter she opened her wardrobe door, to take one last look at\nthe gowns there.They were part of happier days\ngone by.She fell down on her knees and opened the great drawer at the\nbottom, and there on the top lay the dainty gown which had belonged\nto Dorothy Manners.A tear fell upon one of the flowers of the stays.Irresistibly pressed into her mind the memory of Anne\'s fancy dress\nball,--of the episode by the gate, upon which she had thought so often\nwith burning face.The voices below grow louder, but she does not hear.She is folding the\ngown hurriedly into a little package.It was her great-grandmother\'s;\nher chief heirloom after the pearls.Silk and satin from Paris are\nleft behind.With one glance at the bed in which she had slept since\nchildhood, and at the picture over it which had been her mother\'s, she\nhurries downstairs.And Dorothy Manners\'s gown is under her arm.On the\nlanding she stops to brush her eyes with her handkerchief.Ned simply pointed out a young man standing on the\nsteps behind the <DW64>s.Crimson stains were on Virginia\'s cheeks,\nand the package she carried under her arm was like lead.The young\nman, although he showed no signs of excitement, reddened too as he came\nforward and took off his hat.But the sight of him had acurious effect\nupon Virginia, of which she was at first unconscious.A sense of\nsecurity came upon her as she looked at his face and listened to his\nvoice.Brinsmade has gone to the hospital, Miss Carvel," he said.Brinsmade asked me to come here with your man in the hope that I might\npersuade you to stay where you are.""Then the Germans are not moving on the city?"It was that smile that angered her,\nthat made her rebel against the advice he had to offer; that made her\nforget the insult he had risked at her hands by coming there.For she\nbelieved him utterly, without reservation.The moment he had spoken she\nwas convinced that the panic was a silly scare which would be food for\nmerriment in future years.And yet--was not that smile in derision of\nherself--of her friends who were running away?Was it not an assumption\nof Northern superiority, to be resented?"It is only a malicious rumor, Miss Carvel," he answered."You have\nbeen told so upon good authority, I suppose," she said dryly.And at the\nchange in her tone she saw his face fall."I have not," he replied honestly, "but I will submit it to your own\njudgment.Yesterday General Harney superseded Captain Lyon in command\nin St.Some citizens of prominence begged the General to send the\ntroops away, to avoid further ill-feeling and perhaps--bloodshed."(They\nboth winced at the word.)"Colonel Blair represented to the General that\nthe troops could not be sent away, as they had been enlisted to serve\nonly in St.Louis; whereupon the General in his proclamation states that\nhe has no control over these Home Guards.That sentence has been twisted\nby some rascal into a confession that the Home Guards are not to be\ncontrolled.I can assure you, Miss Carvel," added Stephen, speaking\nwith a force which made her start and thrill, "I can assure you from a\npersonal knowledge of the German troops that they are not a riotous lot,\nand that they are under perfect control.If they were not, there are\nenough regulars in the city to repress them."And she was silent, forgetful of the hub-bub around her.It\nwas then that her aunt called out to her, with distressing shrillness,\nfrom the carriage:-- "Jinny, Jinny, how can you stand there talking to\nyoung men when our lives are in danger?"She glanced hurriedly at Stephen, who said gently; "I do not wish to\ndelay you, Miss Carvel, if you are bent upon going."His tone was not resentful, simply quiet.Ephum turned the\ncorner of the street, the perspiration running on his black face."Miss Jinny, dey ain\'t no carridges to be had in this town.This was the occasion for another groan from the <DW64>s, and they began\nonce more to beseech her not to leave them.In the midst of their cries\nshe heard her aunt calling from the carriage, where, beside the trunk,\nthere was just room for her to squeeze in."Jinny," cried that lady, frantically, "are you to go or stay?The\nHessians will be here at any moment.Oh, I cannot stay here to be\nmurdered!"Unconsciously the girl glanced again at Stephen.He had not gone, but\nwas still standing in the rain on the steps, the one figure of strength\nand coolness she had seen this afternoon.Distracted, she blamed the\nfate which had made this man an enemy.How willingly would she have\nleaned upon such as he, and submitted to his guidance.Unluckily at\nthat moment came down the street a group which had been ludicrous on any\nother day, and was, in truth, ludicrous to Stephen then.At the head\nof it was a little gentleman with red mutton-chop whiskers, hatless, in\nspite of the rain beginning to fall.His face was the very caricature of\nterror.His clothes, usually neat, were awry, and his arms were full\nof various things, not the least conspicuous of which was a magnificent\nbronze clock.It was this object that caught Virginia\'s eye.But years\npassed before she laughed over it.Cluyme (for it was he)\ntrotted his family.Cluyme, in a pink wrapper, carried an armful\nof the family silver; then came Belle with certain articles of feminine\napparel which need not be enumerated, and the three small Cluymes of\nvarious ages brought up the rear.Cluyme, at the top of his speed, was come opposite to the carriage\nwhen the lady occupant got out of it.Clutching at his sleeve, she\ndemanded where he was going.His wife coming after\nhim had a narrower escape still.Colfax retained a handful of lace\nfrom the wrapper, the owner of which emitted a shriek of fright."Virginia, I am going to the river," said Mrs."No, indeedy, Miss Lilly, I ain\'t a-gwine \'thout\nyoung Miss.The Dutch kin cotch me an\' hang me, but I ain\'t a-gwine\n\'thout Miss Jinny."Colfax drew her shawl about her shoulders with dignity."Ill as I am, I shall walk.Bear\nwitness that I have spent a precious hour trying to save you.If I live\nto see your father again, I shall tell him that you preferred to stay\nhere and carry on disgracefully with a Yankee, that you let your own\naunt risk her life alone in the rain.She did not run down the steps, but she caught\nher aunt by the arm ere that lady had taken six paces.The girl\'s face\nfrightened Mrs.Colfax into submission, and she let herself be led back\ninto the carriage beside the trunk.Colfax\'s stung\nStephen to righteous anger and resentment--for Virginia.As to himself, he had looked for insult.He turned to go that he might\nnot look upon her confusion; and hanging on the resolution, swung on his\nheel again, his eyes blazeing.He saw in hers the deep blue light of\nthe skies after an evening\'s storm.She was calm, and save for a little\nquiver of the voice, mistress of herself as she spoke to the group of\ncowering servants."Mammy," she said, "get up on the box with Ned.And, Ned, walk the\nhorses to the levee, so that the rest may follow.Ephum, you stay here\nwith the house, and I will send Ned back to keep you company."With these words, clasping tightly the precious little bundle under her\narm, she stepped into the carriage.Heedless of the risk he ran, sheer\nadmiration sent Stephen to the carriage door."If I can be of any service, Miss Carvel," he said, "I shall be happy."And as the horses slipped and started she slammed the door in his face.Down on the levee wheels rattled over the white stones washed clean by\nthe driving rain.The drops pelted the chocolate water into froth, and a\nblue veil hid the distant bluffs beyond the Illinois bottom-lands.Down\non the Levee rich and poor battled for places on the landing-stages, and\nwould have thrown themselves into the flood had there been no boats\nto save them from the dreaded Dutch.Attila and his Huns were not\nmore feared.What might not its\nBarbarians do when roused?The rich and poor struggled together; but\nmoney was a power that day, and many were pitilessly turned off because\nthey did not have the high price to carry them--who knew where?Boats which screamed, and boats which had a dragon\'s roar were backing\nout of the close ranks where they had stood wheel-house to wheel-house,\nand were dodging and bumping in the channel.See, their guards are black\nwith people!Colfax, when they are come out of the narrow street\ninto the great open space, remarks this with alarm.All the boats will\nbe gone before they can get near one.She\nis thinking of other things than the steamboats, and wondering whether\nit had not been preferable to be killed by Hessians.Vance, is\na friend of the family.What a mighty contempt did Ned and his kind have\nfor foot passengers!Laying about him with his whip, and shouting at the\ntop of his voice to make himself heard, he sent the Colonel\'s Kentucky\nbays through the crowd down to the Barbara\'s landing stage, the people\nscampering to the right and left, and the Carvel servants, headed by\nUncle Ben, hanging on to the carriage springs, trailing behind.He will tell you to this day how\nMr.Catherwood\'s carriage was pocketed by drays and bales, and how Mrs.James\'s horses were seized by the bridles and turned back.Ned had a\nhead on his shoulders, and eyes in his head.He spied Captain Vance\nhimself on the stage, and bade Uncle Ben hold to the horses while he\nshouldered his way to that gentleman.The result was that the Captain\ncame bowing to the carriage door, and offered his own cabin to the\nladies.But the <DW65>s---he would take no <DW65>s except a maid for\neach; and he begged Mrs.Colfax\'s pardon--he could not carry her trunk.So Virginia chose Mammy Easter, whose red and yellow turban was awry\nfrom fear lest she be left behind and Ned was instructed to drive the\nrest with all haste to Bellegarde.Colfax his\narm, and Virginia his eyes.He escorted the ladies to quarters in the\ntexas, and presently was heard swearing prodigiously as the boat was\ncast off.It was said of him that he could turn an oath better than any\nman on the river, which was no mean reputation.Colfax was assisted to bed by Susan.Virginia stood by the little\nwindow of the cabin, and as the Barbara paddled and floated down the\nriver she looked anxiously for signals of a conflagration.Nay, in that\nhour she wished that the city might burn.So it is that the best of us\nmay at times desire misery to thousands that our own malice may be\nfed.Virginia longed to see the yellow flame creep along the wet,\ngray clouds.Passionate tears came to her eyes at the thought of the\nhumiliation she had suffered,--and before him, of all men.Could she\never live with her aunt after what she had said?"Carrying on with that\nYankee!"Her anger, too, was still against Stephen.Once more he had been sent by\ncircumstances to mock her and her people.If the city would only burn,\nthat his cocksure judgment might for once be mistaken, his calmness for\nonce broken!The rain ceased, the clouds parted, and the sun turned the muddy river\nto gold.The bluffs shone May-green in the western flood of light, and a\nhaze hung over the bottom-lands.Not a sound disturbed the quiet of\nthe city receding to the northward, and the rain had washed the pall\nof smoke from over it.On the boat excited voices died down to natural\ntones; men smoked on the guards and promenaded on the hurricane deck,\nas if this were some pleasant excursion.Women waved to the other boats\nflocking after.Colfax stirred in\nher berth and began to talk.Virginia did not move\n\n"Jinny!"In that hour she remembered that great good-natured man, her\nmother\'s brother, and for his sake Colonel Carvel had put up with much\nfrom his wife\'s sister in-law.She could pass over, but never forgive\nwhat her aunt had said to her that afternoon.Colfax had often been\ncruel before, and inconsiderate.But as the girl thought of the speech,\nstaring out on the waters, it suddenly occurred to her that no lady\nwould have uttered it.In all her life she had never realized till now\nthat her aunt was not a lady.From that time forth Virginia\'s attitude\ntoward her aunt was changed.She controlled herself, however, and answered something, and went out\nlistlessly to find the Captain and inquire the destination of the boat.At the foot of the companionway\nleading to the saloon deck she saw, of all people, Mr.Eliphalet Hopper\nleaning on the rail, and pensively expectorating on the roof of the\nwheel-house.In another mood Virginia would have laughed, for at sight\nof her he straightened convulsively, thrust his quid into his cheek, and\nremoved his hat with more zeal than the grudging deference he usually\naccorded to the sex.Clearly Eliphalet would not have chosen the\nsituation."I cal\'late we didn\'t get out any too soon, Miss Carvel," he remarked,\nwith a sad attempt at jocoseness."There won\'t be a great deal in that\ntown when the Dutch get through with it.""I think that there are enough men left in it to save it," said\nVirginia.Hopper found no suitable answer to this, for he made\nnone.He continued to glance at her uneasily.There was an impudent\ntribute in his look which she resented strongly."He\'s down below--ma\'am," he replied."Yes," she said, with abrupt maliciousness, "you may tell me where you\nare going.""I cal\'late, up the Cumberland River.That\'s where she\'s bound for,\nif she don\'t stop before she gets there Guess there ain\'t many of \'em\ninquired where she was goin\', or cared much," he added, with a ghastly\neffort to be genial."I didn\'t see any use in gettin\' murdered, when I couldn\'t do anything."He stared after her up the companionway, bit off a\ngenerous piece of tobacco, and ruminated.If to be a genius is to\npossess an infinite stock of patience, Mr.But it was not a pleasant smile to look upon.She had told her aunt the news, and stood\nin the breeze on the hurricane deck looking southward, with her hand\nshading her eyes.The \'Barbara Lane\' happened to be a boat with a\nrecord, and her name was often in the papers.She had already caught up\nwith and distanced others which had had half an hour\'s start of her, and\nwas near the head of the procession.Virginia presently became aware that people were gathering around her in\nknots, gazing at a boat coming toward them.Others had been met which,\non learning the dread news, turned back.But this one kept her bow\nsteadily up the current, although she had passed within a biscuit-toss\nof the leader of the line of refugees.It was then that Captain Vance\'s\nhairy head appeared above the deck.he said, "if here ain\'t pig-headed Brent, steaming the\n\'Jewanita\' straight to destruction.""Oh, are you sure it\'s Captain Brent?""If that there was Shreve\'s old Enterprise come to life again, I\'d lay\ncotton to sawdust that Brent had her.Danged if he wouldn\'t take her\nright into the jaws of the Dutch."The Captain\'s words spread, and caused considerable excitement.On board\nthe Barbara Lane were many gentlemen who had begun to be shamefaced over\ntheir panic, and these went in a body to the Captain and asked him to\ncommunicate with the \'Juanita\'.Whereupon a certain number of whistles\nwere sounded, and the Barbara\'s bows headed for the other side of the\nchannel.As the Juanita drew near, Virginia saw the square figure and clean,\nsmooth-shaven face of Captain Lige standing in front of his wheel-house\nPeace crept back into her soul, and she tingled with joy as the bells\nclanged and the bucket-planks churned, and the great New Orleans packet\ncrept slowly to the Barbara\'s side."You ain\'t goin\' in, Brent?"At the sound of his voice Virginia could\nhave wept."The Dutch are sacking the city," said Vance.A general titter went along the guards, and Virginia blushed."I\'m on my reg\'lar trip, of course," said Vance.Out there on the sunlit\nriver the situation seemed to call for an apology."Seems to be a little more loaded than common," remarked Captain Lige,\ndryly, at which there was another general laugh."If you\'re really goin\' up," said Captain Vance, "I reckon there\'s a few\nhere would like to be massacred, if you\'ll take \'em."Brent; "I\'m bound for the barbecue."While the two great boats were manoeuvring, and slashing with one wheel\nand the other, the gongs sounding, Virginia ran into the cabin."Oh, Aunt Lillian," she exclaimed, "here is Captain Lige and the\nJuanita, and he is going to take us back with him.It its unnecessary here to repeat the moral persuasion which Virginia\nused to get her aunt up and dressed.That lady, when she had heard the\nwhistle and the gongs, had let her imagination loose.Turning her face\nto the wall, she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece\nentered.A big stevedore carried her down two decks to where the gang-plank\nwas thrown across.Captain Lige himself was at the other end.His face\nlighted, Pushing the people aside, he rushed across, snatched the lady\nfrom the <DW64>\'s arms, crying:\n\n"Jinny!The stevedore\'s\nservices were required for Mammy Easter.And behind the burly shield\nthus formed, a stoutish gentleman slipped over, all unnoticed, with a\ncarpet-bag in his hand It bore the initials E. H.\n\nThe plank was drawn in.The great wheels began to turn and hiss, the\nBarbara\'s passengers waved good-by to the foolhardy lunatics who had\nelected to go back into the jaws of destruction.Colfax was put\ninto a cabin; and Virginia, in a glow, climbed with Captain Lige to the\nhurricane deck.There they stood for a while in silence, watching the\nbroad stern of the Barbara growing smaller."Just to think," Miss Carvel\nremarked, with a little hysterical sigh, "just to think that some of\nthose people brought bronze clocks instead of tooth-brushes.""And what did you bring, my girl?"asked the Captain, glancing at the\nparcel she held so tightly under her arm.He never knew why she blushed so furiously.THE STRAINING OF ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP\n\nCaptain Lige asked but two questions: where was the Colonel, and was\nit true that Clarence had refused to be paroled?Though not possessing\nover-fine susceptibilities, the Captain knew a mud-drum from a lady\'s\nwatch, as he himself said.In his solicitude for Virginia, he saw that\nshe was in no state of mind to talk of the occurrences of the last few\ndays.So he helped her to climb the little stair that winds to the top\nof the texas,--that sanctified roof where the pilot-house squats.The\ngirl clung to her bonnet Will you like her any the less when you know\nthat it was a shovel bonnet, with long red ribbons that tied under\nher chin?"Captain Lige," she said, almost\ntearfully, as she took his arm, "how I thank heaven that you came up the\nriver this afternoon!""Jinny," said the Captain, "did you ever know why cabins are called\nstaterooms?""Why, no," answered she, puzzled."There was an old fellow named Shreve who ran steamboats before Jackson\nfought the redcoats at New Orleans.In Shreve\'s time the cabins were\ncurtained off, just like these new-fangled sleeping-car berths.The old\nman built wooden rooms, and he named them after the different states,\nKentuck, and Illinois, and Pennsylvania.So that when a fellow came\naboard he\'d say: \'What state am I in, Cap?\'And from this river has the\nname spread all over the world--stateroom.That\'s mighty interesting,"\nsaid Captain Lige."Yea," said Virginia; "why didn\'t you tell me long ago.""And I\'ll bet you can\'t say," the Captain continued, "why this house\nwe\'re standing on is called the texas.""Because it is annexed to the states," she replied, quick a flash."Well, you\'re bright," said he."Old Tufts got that notion, when Texas\ncame in.Bill Jenks was Captain Brent\'s senior pilot.His skin hung on his face\nin folds, like that of a rhinoceros It was very much the same color.His\ngrizzled hair was all lengths, like a worn-out mop; his hand reminded\none of an eagle\'s claw, and his teeth were a pine yellow.He greeted\nonly such people as he deemed worthy of notice, but he had held Virginia\nin his arms."William," said the young lady, roguishly, "how is the eye, location,\nand memory?"When this happened it was put in\nthe Juanita\'s log."So the Cap\'n be still harpin\' on that?"he said, "Miss Jinny, he\'s just\nplumb crazy on a pilot\'s qualifications.""He says that you are the best pilot on the river, but I don\'t believe\nit," said Virginia.He made a place for her on the leather-padded\nseat at the back of the pilot house, where for a long time she sat\nstaring at the flag trembling on the jackstaff between the great sombre\npipes.The sun fell down, but his light lingered in the air above as the\nbig boat forged abreast the foreign city of South St.There\nwas the arsenal--grim despite its dress of green, where Clarence was\nconfined alone.Captain Lige came in from his duties below."Well, Jinny, we\'ll soon be\nat home," he said."We\'ve made a quick trip against the rains.""And--and do you think the city is safe?""Jinny, would\nyou like to blow the whistle?""I should just love to," said Virginia.Jenks\'s\ndirections she put her toe on the tread, and shrank back when the\nmonster responded with a snort and a roar.River men along the levee\nheard that signal and laughed.The joke was certainly not on sturdy\nElijah Brent.An hour later, Virginia and her aunt and the Captain, followed by Mammy\naster and Rosetta and Susan, were walking through the streets of the\nstillest city in the Union.All that they met was a provost\'s guard, for\nSt.Once in a while they saw the light of\nsome contemptuous citizen of the residence district who had stayed to\nlaugh.Out in the suburbs, at the country houses of the first families,\npeople of distinction slept five and six in a room--many with only a\nquilt between body and matting.Little wonder that these dreamed of\nHessians and destruction.In town they slept with their doors open,\nthose who remained and had faith.Martial law means passes and\nexplanations, and walking generally in the light of day.Martial law\nmeans that the Commander-in-chief, if he be an artist in well doing,\nmay use his boot freely on politicians bland or beetle-browed.No police\nforce ever gave the sense of security inspired by a provost\'s guard.Captain Lige sat on the steps of Colonel Carvel\'s house that night, long\nafter the ladies were gone to bed.The only sounds breaking the silence\nof the city were the beat of the feet of the marching squads and the\ncall of the corporal\'s relief.But the Captain smoked in agony until the\nclouds of two days slipped away from under the stars, for he was trying\nto decide a Question.Then he went up to a room in the house which had\nbeen known as his since the rafters were put down on that floor.The next morning, as the Captain and Virginia sit at breakfast together\nwith only Mammy Easter to cook and Rosetta to wait on them, the Colonel\nbursts in.He is dusty and travel-stained from his night on the train,\nbut his gray eyes light with affection as he sees his friend beside his\ndaughter."Jinny," he cries as he kisses her, "Jinny, I\'m proud oil you, my girl!You didn\'t let the Yankees frighten you--But where is Jackson?"And so the whole miserable tale has to be told over again, between\nlaughter and tears on Virginia\'s part, and laughter and strong language\non Colonel Carvel\'s.What--blessing that Lige met them, else the\nColonel might now be starting for the Cumberland River in search of his\ndaughter.The Captain does not take much part in the conversation, and\nhe refuses the cigar which is offered him."Lige," he says, "this is the first time to my knowledge.""I smoked too many last night," says the Captain.The Colonel sat down,\nwith his feet against the mantel, too full of affairs to take much\nnotice of Mr."The Yanks have taken the first trick--that\'s sure," he said."But I\nthink we\'ll laugh last, Jinny.The\nstate has got more militia, or will have more militia in a day or\ntwo.We won\'t miss the thousand they stole in Camp Jackson.And I\'ve got a few commissions right here," and he\ntapped his pocket."Pa," said Virginia, "did you volunteer?""The Governor wouldn\'t have me," he answered."He said I was more good\nhere in St.The Colonel listened with\nmany exclamations, slapping his knee from time to time as she proceeded.he cried, when she had finished, "the boy has it in him, after\nall!They can\'t hold him a day--can they, Lige?"(No answer from the\nCaptain, who is eating his breakfast in silence.)"All that we have to\ndo is to go for Worington and get a habeas corpus from the United States\nDistrict Court.The Captain got up excitedly, his face\npurple."I reckon you\'ll have to excuse me, Colonel," he said."There\'s a cargo\non my boat which has got to come off."And without more ado he left the\nroom.In consternation they heard the front door close behind him.And\nyet, neither father nor daughter dared in that hour add to the trial\nof the other by speaking out the dread that was in their hearts.The\nColonel smoked for a while, not a word escaping him, and then he patted\nVirginia\'s cheek."I reckon I\'ll run over and see Russell, Jinny," he said, striving to\nbe cheerful.He stopped\nabruptly in the hall and pressed his hand to his forehead."My God," he\nwhispered to himself, "if I could only go to Silas!"Colfax\'s lawyer, of whose politics it is not necessary to speak.There\nwas plenty of excitement around the Government building where his Honor\nissued the writ.There lacked not gentlemen of influence who went with\nMr.Russell and Colonel Carvel and the lawyer and the Commissioner to\nthe Arsenal.They were admitted to the presence of the indomitable Lyon,\nwho informed them that Captain Colfax was a prisoner of war, and, since\nthe arsenal was Government property, not in the state.The Commissioner\nthereupon attested the affidavit to Colonel Carvel, and thus the\napplication for the writ was made legal.These things the Colonel reported to Virginia; and to Mrs.Colfax, who\nreceived them with red eyes and a thousand queries as to whether that\nYankee ruffian would pay any attention to the Sovereign law which he\npretended to uphold; whether the Marshal would not be cast over the\nArsenal wall by the slack of his raiment when he went to serve the writ.This was not the language, but the purport, of the lady\'s questions.Colonel Carvel had made but a light breakfast: he had had no dinner,\nand little rest on the train.But he answered his sister-in-law with\nunfailing courtesy.He was too honest to express a hope which he did not\nfeel.He had returned that evening to a dreary household.During the\nday the servants had straggled in from Bellegarde, and Virginia had had\nprepared those dishes which her father loved.Colfax chose to keep\nher room, for which the two were silently thankful.The Colonel was humming a tune as he went down the stairs, but\nVirginia was not deceived.He would not see the yearning in her eyes as\nhe took his chair; he would not glance at Captain Lige\'s empty seat.She caught her breath when she saw that the\nfood on his plate lay untouched.He pushed his chair away, such suffering in his look as she had never\nseen."Jinny," he said, "I reckon Lige is for the Yankees.""I have known it all along," she said, but faintly."My God," cried the Colonel, in agony, "to think that he kept it from me\nI to think that Lige kept it from me!""It is because he loves you, Pa," answered the girl, gently, "it is\nbecause he loves us."Virginia got up, and went softly around the\ntable."Yes," he said, his voice lifeless.But her courage was not to be lightly shaken."Pa, will you forbid him\nto come here--now?"A long while she waited for his answer, while the big clock ticked out\nthe slow seconds in the hall, and her heart beat wildly."As long as I have a roof, Lige may come under\nit."She did not ask him where he was\ngoing, but ordered Jackson to keep the supper warm, and went into the\ndrawing-room.The lights were out, then, but the great piano that was\nher mother\'s lay open.That wondrous\nhymn which Judge Whipple loved, which for years has been the comfort\nof those in distress, floated softly with the night air out of the\nopen window.Colonel Carvel heard it, and\npaused.He did not stop again until he reached the narrow street at the top\nof the levee bank, where the quaint stone houses of the old French\nresidents were being loaded with wares.He took a few steps back-up the\nhill.Then he wheeled about, walked swiftly down the levee, and on to\nthe landing-stage beside which the big \'Juanita\' loomed in the night.On\nher bows was set, fantastically, a yellow street-car.Its unexpected appearance there had\nserved to break the current of his meditations.He stood staring at it,\nwhile the roustabouts passed and repassed, noisily carrying great logs\nof wood on shoulders padded by their woollen caps."That\'ll be the first street-car used in the city of New Orleans, if it\never gets there, Colonel.""Reckon I\'ll have to stay here and boss the cargo all night.Want to\nget in as many trips as I can before--navigation closes," the Captain\nconcluded significantly."You were never too busy to come for\nsupper, Lige.Captain Lige shot at him a swift look."Come over here on the levee," said the Colonel, sternly.They walked\nout together, and for some distance in silence."Lige," said the elder gentleman, striking his stick on the stones, "if\nthere ever was a straight goer, that\'s you.You\'ve always dealt squarely\nwith me, and now I\'m going to ask you a plain question."I\'m North, I reckon," answered the Captain, bluntly.It was a long time before he spoke again.The Captain waited\nlike a man who expects and deserve, the severest verdict."And you wouldn\'t tell me, Lige?"My God, Colonel," exclaimed the other, passionately, "how could I?I\nowe what I have to your charity.But for you and--and Jinny I should\nhave gone to the devil.If you and she are taken away, what have I left\nin life?I was a coward, sir, not to tell you.And yet,--God help me,--I can\'t stand by and see the nation go to\npieces.Your fathers fought that\nwe Americans might inherit the earth--" He stopped abruptly.Then he\ncontinued haltingly, "Colonel, I know you\'re a man of strong feelings\nand convictions.All I ask is that you and Jinny will think of me as a\nfriend--"\n\nHe choked, and turned away, not heeding the direction of his feet.The\nColonel, his stick raised, stood looking after him.He was folded in the\nnear darkness before he called his name.He came back, wondering, across the rough stones until he stood beside\nthe tall figure.Below them, the lights glided along the dark water."Lige, didn\'t I raise you?Haven\'t I taught you that my house was your\nhome?But--but never speak to me again of this night!Not a word passed between them as they went up the quiet street.At the\nsound of their feet in the entry the door was flung open, and Virginia,\nwith her hands out stretched, stood under the hall light."Oh, Pa, I knew you would bring him back," she said.OF CLARENCE\n\nCaptain Clarence Colfax, late of the State Dragoons, awoke on Sunday\nmorning the chief of the many topics of the conversation of a big city.His conduct drew forth enthusiastic praise from the gentlemen and ladies\nwho had thronged Beauregard and Davis avenues, and honest admiration\nfrom the party which had broken up the camp.There were many doting parents, like Mr.Catherwood, whose boys had\naccepted the parole, whose praise was a trifle lukewarm, to be sure.But popular opinion, when once aroused, will draw a grunt from the most\ngrudging.We are not permitted, alas, to go behind these stern walls and discover\nhow Captain Colfax passed that eventful Sunday of the Exodus.We know\nthat, in his loneliness, he hoped for a visit from his cousin, and took\nto pacing his room in the afternoon, when a smarting sense of injustice\ncrept upon him.And how was he to guess, as he\nlooked out in astonishment upon the frightened flock of white boats\nswimming southward, that his mother and his sweetheart were there?On Monday, while the Colonel and many prominent citizens were busying\nthemselves about procuring the legal writ which was at once to release\nMr.Colfax, and so cleanse the whole body of Camp Jackson\'s defenders\nfrom any, veiled intentions toward the Government, many well known\ncarriages drew up before the Carvel House in Locust Street to\ncongratulate the widow and the Colonel upon the possession of such a\nson and nephew.There were some who slyly congratulated Virginia, whose\nmartyrdom it was to sit up with people all the day long.Colfax\nkept her room, and admitted only a few of her bosom friends to cry with\nher.When the last of the callers was gone, Virginia was admitted to her\naunt\'s presence."Aunt Lillian, to-morrow morning Pa and I are going to the Arsenal with\na basket for Max.Pa seems to think there is a chance that he may come\nback with us.The lady smiled wearily at the proposal, and raised her hands in\nprotest, the lace on the sleeves of her dressing gown falling away from\nher white arms.she exclaimed, "when I can\'t walk to my bureau after that\nterrible Sunday.No," she added, with conviction,\n"I never again expect to see him alive.Comyn says they may release him,\ndoes he?The girl went away, not in anger or impatience, but in sadness.Brought\nup to reverence her elders, she had ignored the shallowness of her\naunt\'s character in happier days.Colfax\'s conduct carried\na prophecy with it.Virginia sat down on the landing to ponder on the\nyears to come,--on the pain they were likely to bring with them from\nthis source--Clarence gone to the war; her father gone (for she felt\nthat he would go in the end), Virginia foresaw the lonely days of trial\nin company with this vain woman whom accident made her cousin\'s mother.Ay, and more, fate had made her the mother of the man she was to marry.The girl could scarcely bear the thought--through the hurry and swing of\nthe events of two days she had kept it from her mind.To-morrow he would be coming home\nto her joyfully for his reward, and she did not love him.She was bound\nto face that again and again.She had cheated herself again and again\nwith other feelings.She had set up intense love of country in the\nshrine where it did not belong, and it had answered--for a while.She\nsaw Clarence in a hero\'s light--until a fatal intimate knowledge made\nher shudder and draw back.Captain Lige\'s cheery voice roused her from below--and her father\'s\nlaugh.And as she went down to them she thanked God that this friend had\nbeen spared to him.Never had the Captain\'s river yarns been better told\nthan at the table that evening.Virginia did not see him glance at the\nColonel when at last he had brought a smile to her face."I\'m going to leave Jinny with you, Lige," said Mr."Worington has some notion that the Marshal may go to the Arsenal\nto-night with the writ.she pleaded\n\nThe Colonel was taken aback.He stood looking down at her, stroking his\ngoatee, and marvelling at the ways of woman."The horses have been out all day, Jinny," he said, "I am going in the\ncars.""I can go in the cars, too.""There is only a chance that we shall see Clarence," he went on,\nuneasily."It is better than sitting still," cried Virginia, as she ran away to\nget the bonnet with the red strings."Lige,--" said the Colonel, as the two stood awaiting her in the hall,\n"I can\'t make her out.It was a long journey, in a bumping car with had springs that rattled\nunceasingly, past the string of provost guards.The Colonel sat in the\ncorner, with his head bent down over his stick At length, cramped and\nweary, they got out, and made their way along the Arsenal wall, past the\nsentries to the entrance.The sergeant brought his rifle to a "port".Carver\n\n"Captain Colfax was taken to Illinois in a skiff, quarter of an hour\nsince."Captain Lige gave vent to a long, low whistle.he exclaimed, "and the river this high!Before he could answer came the noise of steps from the direction of\nthe river, and a number of people hurried up excitedly.Worington, the lawyer, and caught him by the sleeve.Worington glanced at the sentry, and pulled the Colonel past the\nentrance and into the street."They have started across with him in a light skiff----four men and a\ncaptain.And a lot of us, who suspected\nwhat they were up to, were standing around.When we saw \'em come down,\nwe made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to\nstand back.""Cuss me if I understand him," said Mr."He told us to\ndisperse, and that he proposed to remain a prisoner and go where they\nsent him."Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," said the sentry,\nand they started to walk toward the car line, the lawyer and the Colonel\ntogether.Virginia put her hand through the Captain\'s arm.In the\ndarkness he laid his big one over it."Don\'t you be frightened, Jinny, at what I said, I reckon they\'ll fetch\nup in Illinois all right, if I know Lyon.There, there," said Captain\nLige, soothingly.She had endured more in\nthe past few days than often falls to the lot of one-and-twenty.He thought of the\nmany, many times he had taken her on his knee and kissed her tears.He\nmight do that no more, now.There was the young Captain, a prisoner on\nthe great black river, who had a better right, Elijah Brent wondered, as\nthey waited in the silent street for the lonely car, if Clarence loved\nher as well as he.It was vary late when they reached home, and Virginia went silently up\nto her room.Colonel Carvel stared grimly after her, then glanced at his\nfriend as he turned down the lights.The eyes of the two met, as of old,\nin true understanding.The sun was still slanting over the tops of the houses the next morning\nwhen Virginia, a ghostly figure, crept down the stairs and withdrew\nthe lock and bolt on the front door.The street was still, save for\nthe twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early\nrounds.The chill air of the morning made her shiver as she scanned the\nentry for the newspaper.Dismayed, she turned to the clock in the hall.She sat long behind the curtains in her father\'s little library, the\nthoughts whirling in her brain as she watched the growing life of\nanother day.Once she stole softly back to\nthe entry, self-indulgent and ashamed, to rehearse again the bitter and\nthe sweet of that scene of the Sunday before.She summoned up the image\nof the young man who had stood on these steps in front of the frightened\nservants.She seemed to feel again the calm power and earnestness of his\nface, to hear again the clear-cut tones of his voice as he advised\nher.Then she drew back, frightened, into the sombre library,\nconscience-stricken that she should have yielded to this temptation\nthen, when Clarence--She dared not follow the thought, but she saw the\nlight skiff at the mercy of the angry river and the dark night.If he were spared, she prayed for strength to\nconsecrate herself to him A book lay on the table, and Virginia took\nrefuge in it.And her eyes glancing over the pages, rested on this\nverse:--\n\n       "Thy voice is heard thro\' rolling drums,\n        That beat to battle where he stands;\n        Thy face across his fancy comes,\n        And gives the battle to his hands."The paper brought no news, nor mentioned the ruse to which Captain Lyon\nhad resorted to elude the writ by transporting his prisoner to Illinois.Newspapers were not as alert then as now.Colonel Carvel was off early\nto the Arsenal in search of tidings.He would not hear of Virginia\'s\ngoing with him.Captain Lige, with a surer instinct, went to the river.Twice Virginia was summoned to her aunt, and\ntwice she made excuse.It was the Captain who returned first, and she\nmet him at the door."He is alive," said the Captain, tremulously, "alive and well, and\nescaped South."She took a step toward him, and swayed.For a\nbrief instant he held her in his arms and then he led her to the great\narmchair that was the Colonel\'s."Lige," she said, "--are you sure that this is not--a kindness?""No, Jinny," he answered quickly, "but things were mighty close.They struck out straight\nacross, but they drifted and drifted like log-wood.And then she began\nto fill, and all five of \'em to bail.The\nfive soldiers came up on that bit of an island below the Arsenal.They\nhunted all night, but they didn\'t find Clarence.And they got taken off\nto the Arsenal this morning.""I knew that much this morning," he continued, "and so did your pa.But\nthe Andrew Jackson is just in from Memphis, and the Captain tells me\nthat he spoke the Memphis packet off Cape Girardeau, and that Clarence\nwas aboard.She picked him up by a miracle, after he had just missed a\nround trip through her wheel-house."CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING A CAPITALIST\n\nA cordon of blue regiments surrounded the city at first from Carondelet\nto North St.The crowds liked best to go to\nCompton Heights, where the tents of the German citizen-soldiers were\nspread out like so many slices of white cake on the green beside the\ncity\'s reservoir.Thence the eye stretched across the town, catching the\ndome of the Court House and the spire of St.Away to the west,\non the line of the Pacific railroad that led halfway across the state,\nwas another camp.Then another, and another, on the circle of the fan,\nuntil the river was reached to the northward, far above the bend.Within\nwas a peace that passed understanding,--the peace of martial law.Without the city, in the great state beyond, an irate governor had\ngathered his forces from the east and from the west.Letters came and\nwent between Jefferson City and Jefferson Davis, their purport being\nthat the Governor was to work out his own salvation, for a while\nat least.Louis, struck in a night by the fever of\nmilitarism, arose and went to Glencoe.Prying sergeants and commissioned\nofficers, mostly of hated German extraction, thundered at the door\nof Colonel Carvel\'s house, and other houses, there--for Glencoe was\na border town.They searched the place more than once from garret to\ncellar, muttered guttural oaths, and smelled of beer and sauerkraut, The\nhaughty appearance of Miss Carvel did not awe them--they were blind\nto all manly sensations.The Colonel\'s house, alas, was one of many in\nGlencoe written down in red ink in a book at headquarters as a place\ntoward which the feet of the young men strayed.Good evidence was\nhanded in time and time again that the young men had come and gone, and\nred-faced commanding officers cursed indignant subalterns, and implied\nthat Beauty had had a hand in it.Councils of war were held over the\nadvisability of seizing Mr.Carvel\'s house at Glencoe, but proof was\nlacking until one rainy night in June a captain and ten men spurred up\nthe drive and swung into a big circle around the house.The Captain\ntook off his cavalry gauntlet and knocked at the door, more gently than\nusual.The Captain was given an\naudience more formal than one with the queen of Prussia could have been,\nMiss Carvel was infinitely more haughty than her Majesty.Was not the\nCaptain hired to do a degrading service?Indeed, he thought so as he\nfollowed her about the house and he felt like the lowest of criminals\nas he opened a closet door or looked under a bed.He was a beast of the\nfield, of the mire.How Virginia shrank from him if he had occasion to\npass her!Her gown would have been defiled by his touch.And yet the\nCaptain did not smell of beer, nor of sauerkraut; nor did he swear in\nany language.He did his duty apologetically, but he did it.He pulled\na man (aged seventeen) out from under a great hoop skirt in a little\ncloset, and the man had a pistol that refused its duty when snapped in\nthe Captain\'s face.This was little Spencer Catherwood, just home from a\nmilitary academy.Spencer was taken through the rain by the chagrined Captain to the\nheadquarters, where he caused a little embarrassment.No damning\nevidence was discovered on his person, for the pistol had long since\nceased to be a firearm.And so after a stiff lecture from the Colonel\nhe was finally given back into the custody of his father.Despite the\npickets, the young men filtered through daily,--or rather nightly.Presently some of them began to come back, gaunt and worn and tattered,\namong the grim cargoes that were landed by the thousands and tens of\nthousands on the levee.And they took them (oh, the pity of it!)Lynch\'s slave pen, turned into a Union prison of\ndetention, where their fathers and grandfathers had been wont to send\ntheir disorderly and insubordinate <DW65>s.They were packed away, as\nthe miserable slaves had been, to taste something of the bitterness\nof the <DW64>\'s lot.So came Bert Russell to welter in a low room whose\nwalls gave out the stench of years.How you cooked for them, and schemed\nfor them, and cried for them, you devoted women of the South!You spent\nthe long hot summer in town, and every day you went with your baskets\nto Gratiot Street, where the infected old house stands, until--until one\nmorning a lady walked out past the guard, and down the street.She was\ncivilly detained at the corner, because she wore army boots.If you were a young lady of the proper principles\nin those days, you climbed a steep pair of stairs in the heat, and stood\nin line until it became your turn to be catechised by an indifferent\nyoung officer in blue who sat behind a table and smoked a horrid cigar.He had little time to be courteous.He was not to be dazzled by a bright\ngown or a pretty face; he was indifferent to a smile which would have\nwon a savage.His duty was to look down into your heart, and extract\ntherefrom the nefarious scheme you had made to set free the man you\nloved ere he could be sent north to Alton or Columbus.My dear, you\nwish to rescue him, to disguise him, send him south by way of Colonel\nCarvel\'s house at Glencoe.At least, he will\nhave died for the South.First politics, and then war, and then more politics, in this our\ncountry.Your masterful politician obtains a regiment, and goes to war,\nsword in hand.He fights well, but he is still the politician.It\nwas not a case merely of fighting for the Union, but first of getting\npermission to fight.Camp Jackson taken, and the prisoners exchanged\nsouth, Captain Lyon; who moved like a whirlwind, who loved the Union\nbeyond his own life, was thrust down again.A mutual agreement was\nentered into between the Governor and the old Indian fighter in command\nof the Western Department, to respect each other.How Lyon chafed, and paced the Arsenal walks while he might have\nsaved the state.Then two gentlemen went to Washington, and the next\nthing that happened was Brigadier General Lyon, Commander of the\nDepartment of the West.Would General Lyon confer with the Governor of Missouri?Yes, the\nGeneral would give the Governor a safe-conduct into St.Louis, but\nhis Excellency must come to the General.His Excellency came, and the\nGeneral deigned to go with the Union leader to the Planters House.Conference, five hours; result, a safe-conduct for the Governor back.And this is how General Lyon ended the talk.His words, generously\npreserved by a Confederate colonel who accompanied his Excellency,\ndeserve to be writ in gold on the National Annals."Rather than concede to the state of Missouri the right to demand that\nmy Government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops\ninto the state whenever it pleases; or move its troops at its own will\ninto, out of, or through, the state; rather than concede to the state of\nMissouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my Government in\nany matter, however unimportant, I would" (rising and pointing in turn\nto every one in the room) "see you, and you, and you, and you, and every\nman, woman, and child in this state, dead and buried."Then, turning\nto the Governor, he continued, "This means war.In an hour one of my\nofficers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines."And thus, without another word, without an inclination of the head, he\nturned upon his heel and strode out of the room, rattling his spurs and\nclanking his sabre.In less than two months that indomitable leader was\nlying dead beside Wilson\'s Creek, among the oaks on Bloody Hill.What he\nwould have been to this Union, had God spared him, we shall never know.He saved Missouri, and won respect and love from the brave men who\nfought against him.What prayers rose to heaven,\nand curses sank to hell, when the news of them came to the city by\nthe river!Flags were made by loving fingers, and shirts and bandages.Trembling young ladies of Union sympathies presented colors to regiments\non the Arsenal Green, or at Jefferson Barracks, or at Camp Benton to the\nnorthwest near the Fair Grounds.And then the regiments marched through\nthe streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the\nBattle Hymn were set, and those bright ensigns snapping at the front;\nbright now, and new, and crimson.But soon to be stained a darker red,\nand rent into tatters, and finally brought back and talked over and\ncried over, and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case, to\nbe revered by generations of Americans to confer What can stir the\nsoul more than the sight of those old flags, standing in ranks like\nthe veterans they are, whose duty has been nobly done?The blood of the\ncolor-sergeant is there, black now with age.But where are the tears of\nthe sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together?The regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats, and\npushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags.Later--much later, black headlines, and grim\nlists three columns long,--three columns of a blanket sheet!"The City\nof Alton has arrived with the following Union dead and wounded, and\nthe following Confederate wounded (prisoners)."In a never-ceasing procession they steamed up the river; those calm\nboats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of Commerce now\nbearing the red cargoes of war.And they bore away to new battlefields\nthousands of fresh-faced boys from Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota,\ngathered at Camp Benton.Some came back with their color gone and their\nred cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken.Stephen Brice, with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat,\nwalked on the pavement beside his old company, but his look avoided\ntheir faces.He wrung Richter\'s hand on the landing-stage.The good German\'s eyes were filled as he said good-by."You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you," he said."Now" (and he shrugged his shoulders), "now have we many with no cares\nto go.I have not even a father--" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who\nwas standing by, holding out a bony hand."God bless you, Carl," said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his\nears.He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as\nshe backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were\nthe gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the\nedge of the landing.Stephen\'s chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the\nJudge, he could not trust himself to speak.Back to the silent office\nwhere the shelves mocked them.The Judge closed the ground-glass door\nbehind him, and Stephen sat until five o\'clock over a book.No, it was\nnot Whittlesey, but Hardee\'s "Tactics."He shut it with a slam, and went\nto Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested\ncitizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about\nface.For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of\nthem.One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the\nwounded with an equanimity truly philosophical.When the regiments\npassed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr.Hopper did\nnot often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known\nto go to the door to bid them Godspeed.This was all very well, because\nthey were Union regiments.Hopper did not contribute a horse,\nnor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in\nthe night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them.One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office,\ntoo hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum\'s face as he watched his\nmaster.The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel.Since May\nhe had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public,\nand which were so mysterious that even Mr.Hopper could not get wind\nof them.These matters had taken the Colonel out of town.But now the\nnecessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than\nGlencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday.Hopper rose from\nhis chair when Mr.Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action.Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it\nuneasily.Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a\nsmile was on his face.Carvel\'s chair with\na semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a\nthought.He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper\nwhich had indorsements on their backs.His fine lips were tightly\nclosed, as if in pain.Hopper," he said, "these Eastern notes are due this week, are they\nnot?""There is no use mincing matters, Hopper.You know as well as I that\nthere is no money to pay them," said he, with a certain pompous attempt\nat severity which characterized his kind nature.You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made\nit as prosperous as any in the town.I am sorry, sir, that those\ncontemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut\nshort many promising business careers such as yours, sir.And the good gentleman looked\nout of the window.He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War,\nwhen his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr."These notes cannot be met," he repeated, and his voice was near to\nbreaking.The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound.Outside the\npartition, among the bales, was silence.Hopper, with a remarkable ease, "I cal\'late these\nnotes can be met."The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell\nto the floor.Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it."There isn\'t a bank in town\nthat will lend me money.I--I haven\'t a friend--a friend I may ask who\ncan spare it, sir."Suavity was come upon\nit like a new glove and changed the man.Now\nhe had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in\nleather and mahogany offices."I will take up those notes myself, sir."cried the Colonel, incredulously, "You?"There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his\nnature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan.He did not\nbeam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and\nfriendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules.But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and\nunnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of\nthose who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last.When we\nare thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little\nbosoms that may burst into flame and burn us.Not that Colonel Carvel\nhad ever been aught but courteous and kind to all.His station in life\nhad been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation\nthat made him tremble."I cal\'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes,\nColonel.Here followed an interval\nof sheer astonishment to Mr."And you will take my note for the amount?"The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face\nthe new light in which he saw his manager.He knew well enough that the\nman was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude.He reviewed\nhis whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to\nthe shipping room, to his replacement of Mr.Hood, and there was nothing\nwith which to accuse him.He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige\nand Virginia.He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now.He\nwould not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs.Colfax, to let him touch the money\nhe had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia\'s mother had\nleft the girl was sacred.Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those\nEastern debts.Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern\ngentleman.His house would bring nothing\nin these times.He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his\nchin.Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the\nthird time stopped abruptly before him."Where the devil did you get this money, sir?""I haven\'t been extravagant, Colonel, since I\'ve worked for you,"\nhe said."It don\'t cost me much to live.The furrows in the Colonel\'s brow deepened."You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr.Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it."Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it.But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of\npaper from a pigeonhole."These be some of my investments," he answered, with just a tinge of\nsurliness."I cal\'late they\'ll stand inspection.I ain\'t forcing you to\ntake the money, sir," he flared up, all at once."I\'d like to save the\nbusiness."He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save\nGod knew the shock that his pride received that day.To rescue a name\nwhich had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he\ndrew forth some blank notes, and filled them out.But before he signed\nthem he spoke:\n\n"You are a business man, Mr.Hopper," said he, "And as a business man\nyou must know that these notes will not legally hold.The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St."One moment, sir," cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his\nfull height."Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or\nyour security, which is this business.I need not tell you, sir, that my\nword is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.""I\'m not afraid, Colonel," answered Mr.Hopper, with a feeble attempt at\ngeniality.He was, in truth, awed at last."If you\nwere--this instant you should leave this place."He sat down, and\ncontinued more calmly: "It will not be long before a Southern Army\nmarches into St."Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then,\nMr.God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel\'s simple faith.And if\nEliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here."Leave that to me, Colonel," he said soberly.The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that\nbusiness which had been an honor to the city where it was founded, I\nthank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk\nthat day.Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those\nnotes, or the time?Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed.It was the\nsignal for the little force which remained to leave.Outside, in the\nstore; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out.Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld\nMr.Carvel with his head bowed, down in his hands."Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago,\nbefo\'--befo\' she done left us?"He saw the faithful old <DW64> but dimly.Faintly he heard the pleading\nvoice."Marse Comyn, won\' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap\'n\nLige?""Ephum," said the Colonel, sadly, "I had a letter from the Captain\nyesterday.His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in\nYankee pay."Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, "But de Cap\'n\'s yo\' friend,\nMarse Comyn.He ain\'t never fo\'get what you done fo\' him, Marse Comyn.He ain\'t in de army, suh.""And I am the Captain\'s friend, Ephum," answered the Colonel, quietly."But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government.No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments."Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that\nnight.Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many\nhalts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the\ncity.At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the\nentrances of the sale stables there.Whips are cracking like pistol\nshots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States\nArmy are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and\nfingering the frightened animals.A herd breaks from the confusion\nand is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market\nHouse.They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the\nbattlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.Hopper alights from the car with complacency.He stands for a\nwhile on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene,\nunnoticed.Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into\nMr.Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out\nof one of the offices, and perceives our friend.Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned."Wal, I jest reckon," is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the\nappearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of\ngenteel importance.He could not have been more than two and twenty, and\nhis face and manners were those of a clerk.The tan of field service was\nlacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes."Hullo, Ford," he said, jocularly."Howdy, Cap," retorted the other."Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry,\nfo\' sure.Gov\'ment\nain\'t cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon."Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face\nthat the Captain smiled.And at the same time he glanced down nervously\nat the new line of buttons on his chest."I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time," said he."Wal, I jest reckon," asserted Mr."Cap\'n\nWentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr.Hopper,\nCap\'n Wentworth.""You interested in\nmules, Mr."I don\'t cal\'late to be," said.Let us hope that our worthy\nhas not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor.He\ngrinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added,\n"I\'m just naturally patriotic, I guess.Cap\'n, \'ll you have a drink?""It\'s d--d tiresome lookin\' at mules all\nday in the sun."Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen,\nthat the good man\'s charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down\ntown.Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School,\nit is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by\nMr.Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear.And Eliphalet understands that\nthe good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart\npeople a chance to practise their talents.Hopper neither drinks nor\nsmokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly\nair, Mr.Hopper turns to Ford--"Don\'t lose no time in presenting them\nvouchers at headquarters," says he.And\nthere\'s grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we\nhave an investigation, we\'ll whistle.He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but\nhis face is not a delight to look upon, "Hopper, you\'ll be a d--d rich\nman some day."And because I ain\'t got no capital, I only get\nfour per cent.""Don\'t one-twenty a day suit you?"And you\'ve got horse contracts, and\nblanket contracts besides.What\'s to prevent my goin\' south\nwhen the vouchers is cashed?""Then your mother\'ll have\nto move out of her little place."NEWS FROM CLARENCE\n\nThe epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the\nMississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine.Thousands of our population, by the\nsudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment.When gaunt\nfamine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should\ninquire the cause.Virginia did not read this

army?Wasn\'t\nSouther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell\'s\nto Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?"She laughed at the\nrecollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too."Puss hasn\'t been\naround much since.I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks\nof people.""I\'ll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and\nClarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment," Mrs.Colfax\nwent on, "It won\'t be long now.""Oh, you can\'t have read the papers.And don\'t you remember the letter\nMaude had from George?They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt\nLillian.And half of Price\'s men have no arms at all."Colfax, "bring me a newspaper."All we know is that Lyon has left\nSpringfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming,\nPerhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day."Colfax burst into tears, "Oh, Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so\ncruel!"That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly\neye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed\na letter to Mrs.In the hall he slipped into Virginia\'s hand\nanother, in a "Jefferson Davis" envelope, and she thrust it in her\ngown--the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen\nClarence, and that he was well.In two days an answer might be left\nat Mr.But she must be careful what she wrote, as the\nYankee scouts were active.Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man.Glory and uniform became\nhim well, but danger and deprivation better.The words he had written,\ncareless and frank and boyish, made Virginia\'s heart leap with pride.Colfax\'s letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when\nthe frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the\ncaptain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had\nfloated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had\ncontrived to seize the branches of a huge tree floating by.And how by a\nmiracle the moon had risen.When the great Memphis packet bore down upon\nhim, he had, been seen from her guards, and rescued and made much of;\nand set ashore at the next landing, for fear her captain would get into\ntrouble.In the morning he had walked into the country, first providing\nhimself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowie-knife.Virginia\nwould never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this\nguise.The letter was long for Clarence, and written under great difficulties\nfrom date to date.For nearly a month he had tramped over mountains\nand across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of\nresistance in Missouri.Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living\non greasy bacon and corn pone, at length he crossed the swift Gasconade\n(so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where\nthe bridge of the Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor\'s\norders.Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the\nMissouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and\nthat the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville.Footsore,\nbut undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was\nretreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.On the banks of the Osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad\na plight as himself.They travelled together, until one day some rough\nfarmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders\nof a creek and arrested all three for Union spies.Clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper\ncaptain of the State Dragoons.His Excellency, the Governor of Missouri (so acknowledged by all good\nSoutherners), likewise laughed when Mr.Colfax and the two others were\nbrought before him.His Excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp\nwhich had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame.Louis in butternuts and\nrawhide boots?""Give me a razor," demanded Clarence, with indignation, "a razor and a\nsuit of clothes, and I will prove it."A suit of clothes You know not what you ask."George Catherwood was\nbrought in,--or rather what had once been George.Now he was a big\nfrontiersman with a huge blond beard, and a bowie, knife stuck into\nhis trousers in place of a sword.He recognized his young captain of\ndragoons the Governor apologized, and Clarence slept that night in the\ncabin.The next day he was given a horse, and a bright new rifle which\nthe Governor\'s soldiers had taken from the Dutch at Cole Camp on the way\nsouth, And presently they made a junction with three thousand more who\nwere their images.This was Price\'s army, but Price had gone ahead into\nKansas to beg the great McCulloch and his Confederates to come to their\naid and save the state."Dear mother, I wish that you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have\n   seen this country rabble.How you would have laughed, and cried,\n   because we are just like them.In the combined army two thousand\n   have only bowie-knives or clubs.Some have long rifles of Daniel\n   Boone\'s time, not fired for thirty years.And the impedimenta are a\n   sight.Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and\n   even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and\n   feather beds.But we\'ve got spirit, and we can whip Lyon\'s Dutchmen\n   and Yankees just as we are.Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees\n   haven\'t got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under\n   Colonel Rives.I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred,\n   Jefferson.Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we\n   march into St."COWSKIN PRAIRIE, 9th July."We have whipped Sigel on the prairie by <DW53> Creek and killed--we\n   don\'t know how many.Tell Maude that George distinguished himself\n   in the fight."We have at last met McCulloch and his real soldiers.We cheered\n   until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray, with the gold\n   buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars.General McCulloch\n   has taken me on his staff, and promised me a uniform.But how to\n   clothe and feed and arm our men!We have only a few poor cattle,\n   and no money.We shall whip the\n   Yankees before we starve."Colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which\nher dear boy was forced to endure.He, who was used to linen sheets and\neider down, was without rough blanket or shelter; who was used to the\nbest table in the state, was reduced to husks."But, Aunt Lillian," cried Virginia, "he is fighting for the South.If\nhe were fed and clothed like the Yankees, we should not be half so proud\nof him."Why set down for colder gaze the burning words that Clarence wrote to\nVirginia.How she pored over that letter, and folded it so that even\nthe candle-droppings would not be creased and fall away!He was happy,\nthough wretched because he could not see her.It was the life he had\nlonged for.he was proving his usefulness\nin this world.He was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden."Jinny, do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would\n   come of our not being able to work?How I wish you could see us\n   felling trees to make bullet-moulds, and forging slugs for canister,\n   and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks.Jinny dear, I know that you will keep up your courage.I can see\n   you sewing for us, I can hear you praying for us."It was, in truth, how Virginia learned to sew.Her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began.Sad\nto relate, her bandages, shirts, and havelocks never reached the\nfront,--those havelocks, to withstand the heat of the tropic sun, which\nwere made in thousands by devoted Union women that first summer of the\nwar, to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers."Why should not our soldiers have them, too?"They were never so happy as when sewing on them against\nthe arrival of the Army of Liberation, which never came.The long, long days of heat dragged slowly, with little to cheer those\nfamilies separated from their dear ones by a great army.Clarence might\ndie, and a month--perhaps a year--pass without news, unless he were\nbrought a prisoner to St.How Virginia envied Maude because the\nUnion lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother\nTom, at least!How she coveted the many Union families, whose sons and\nbrothers were at the front, this privilege!We were speaking of the French Revolution, when, as Balzac remarked, to\nbe a spy was to be a patriot.Heads are not so cheap in our Anglo-Saxon\ncountries; passions not so fierce and uncontrollable.Compare, with a\nprominent historian, our Boston Massacre and St.Compare Camp Jackson, or Baltimore, where a\nfew people were shot, with some Paris street scenes after the Bastille.Our own provost marshal was\nhissed in the street, and called "Robespierre," and yet he did not fear\nthe assassin\'s knife.Our own Southern aristocrats were hemmed in in\na Union city (their own city).No women were thrown into prison, it is\ntrue.Yet one was not permitted to shout for Jeff Davis on the street\ncorner before the provost\'s guard.Once in a while a detachment of\nthe Home Guards, commanded by a lieutenant; would march swiftly into a\nstreet and stop before a house, whose occupants would run to the rear,\nonly to encounter another detachment in the alley.One day, in great excitement, Eugenie Renault rang the bell of the\nCarvel house, and ran past the astounded Jackson up the stairs to\nVirginia\'s room, the door of which she burst open.she cried, "Puss Russell\'s house is surrounded by Yankees,\nand Puss and Emily and all the family are prisoners!"said Virginia, dropping in her excitement her\nlast year\'s bonnet, which she was trimming with red, white, and red."Because," said Eugenie, sputtering with indignation "because they waved\nat some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen.Russell\'s house under guard--Puss had a\nsmall--"\n\n"Confederate flag," put in Virginia, smiling in spite of herself."And she waved it between the shutters," Eugenie continued."And some\none told, the provost marshal.He has had the house surrounded, and the\nfamily have to stay there.""Then," said Miss Renault, in a voice of awe, "then each one of the\nfamily is to have just a common army ration.They are to be treated as\nprisoners.""Oh, those Yankees are detestable!"As soon as our army is organized and equipped, they shall\npay for it ten times over."She tried on the bonnet, conspicuous with\nits red and white ribbons, before the glass.Then she ran to the closet\nand drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings."Wait for me,\nGenie," she said, "and we\'ll go down to Puss\'s house together.It may\ncheer her to see us.""But not in that dress," said Eugenie, aghast.And her eyes flashed so\nthat Eugenie was frightened.Miss Renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from\nbeneath her black lashes.It was about five in the afternoon when they\nstarted out together under Virginia\'s white parasol, Eugenie\'s slimmer\ncourage upheld by her friend\'s bearing.We must remember that\nVirginia was young, and that her feelings were akin to those our\ngreat-grandmothers experienced when the British held New York.It was\nas if she had been born to wear the red and white of the South.Elderly\ngentlemen of Northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile\nin admiration,--some sadly, as Mr.Young gentlemen found an\nexcuse to retrace their steps a block or two.But Virginia walked on\nair, and saw nothing.She was between fierce anger and exaltation.She\ndid not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard\nin front of Puss Russell\'s house (these men were only human, after all);\nshe did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the\ncorner, who could not resist a murmur of delight.The citizen sergeant\nonly smiled, and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white.Nor did Puss fling open the blinds and wave at her.Russell won\'t let her," said Virginia,\ndisconsolately, "Genie, let\'s go to headquarters, and show this Yankee\nGeneral Fremont that we are not afraid of him."Eugenie\'s breath was taken away by the very boldness of this\nproposition.. She looked up timidly into Virginia\'s face, and\nhero-worship got the better of prudence.The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came\nback from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one.It\nstill stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and\nvery wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall\nand broad, and a high basement.Two stately stone porches capped by\nelaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side.In short, the house is of that type built\nby many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best\nstood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would\nnot clash with the architectural education which we are receiving.A\nspacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall\nof dressed stones, capped by an iron fence.The whole expressed wealth,\nsecurity, solidity, conservatism.Alas, that the coal deposits under\nthe black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven\nthe owners of these houses out of them!They are now blackened, almost\nburied in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the\nold families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with\na sigh.The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and\nwest-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came\nin sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them.Talk\nwas rife over the commanding general\'s pomp and circumstance.He had\njust returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military\nwere wedded.Foreign officers should come to America to teach our\narmy dress and manners.A dashing Hungarian commanded the general\'s\nbody-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street\nbefore the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd\nthat feared to jest.They felt like it save when they caught the stern\nmilitary eye of the Hungarian captain.Virginia gazed at the glittering\nuniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses,\nand scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of\nSouthern patriots on the burning prairies.Just then a sharp command\nescaped in broken English from the Hungarian.The people in the yard of\nthe mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the\ngate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter.As he put\nfoot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again\nto be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner.For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air.Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff,\nwho smiled and began to walk toward them.Little Eugenie\'s knees\ntrembled.She seized Virginia\'s arm, and whispered in agony."Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all.Oh, I wish you hadn\'t\nbeen so bold!""Hush," said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with\na look.She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the\ninsolence of that smile.How dare he march undaunted to within six paces\nof those eyes?The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat?"Oh, I hope he will arrest me," she said passionately, to Eugenie."He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell."No, those were not\nthe words, surely.He bowed very\nlow and said:\n\n"Ladies, the General\'s compliments, and he begs that this much of the\nsidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments."What was left for them, after that, save a retreat?But he was not\nprecipitate.Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing\nwhich drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side.And there she\nstood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away.A\ncrowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers\nin uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards.One\ncivilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the\ngate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down\nthe side street.Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel.More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head.Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise,\nstartled her."May I have the pleasure," said that gentleman, "of accompanying you\nhome?"Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed."You must not come out of your way," she said."I am\nsure you must go back to the store.Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave\nEliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him.His was a nature\nwhich liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for\nsweet girls; they cloyed.He\nhad revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion, and thrown out\nsome of the vernacular."Business is not so pressing nowadays, Miss Carvel," he answered, with a\nshade of meaning."Then existence must be rather heavy for you," she said.She made\nno attempt to introduce him to Eugenie."If we should have any more\nvictories like Bull Run, prosperity will come back with a rush," said\nthe son of Massachusetts."Southern Confederacy, with Missouri one of\nits stars an industrial development of the South--fortunes in cotton."Virginia turned quickly, "Oh, how dare you?""How dare you\nspeak flippantly of such things?"His suavity was far from overthrown."I assure you that I want to see the\nSouth win."What he did not know was that words seldom convince women.But he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time."Do\nyou cal\'late," said he,--that I could work for your father, and wish\nruin to his country?""But you are a Yankee born," she exclaimed."There be a few sane Yankees," replied Mr.A remark\nwhich made Eugenie laugh outright, and Virginia could not refrain from a\nsmile.But much against her will he walked home with her.She was indignant by\nthe time she reached Locust Street.He had never dared do such a thing\nbefore, What had got into the man?Was it because he had become\na manager, and governed the business during her father\'s frequent\nabsences?Hopper\'s politics, he would always be to\nher a low-born Yankee, a person wholly unworthy of notice.At the corner of Olive Street, a young man walking with long strides\nalmost bumped into them.He paused looked back, and bowed as if\nuncertain of an acknowledgment.He had\nbeen very close to her, and she had had time to notice that his coat was\nthreadbare.When she looked again, he had covered half the block.Why should she care if Stephen Brice had seen her in company with Mr.Eliphalet, too, had seen Stephen, and this had added zest to his\nenjoyment.It was part of the fruits of his reward.He wished in that\nshort walk that he might meet Mr.Cluyme and Belle, and every man and\nwoman and child in the city whom he knew.From time to time he glanced\nat the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him (he had to look up a\nbit, likewise), and that look set him down among the beasts of prey.For she was his rightful prey, and he meant not to lose one tittle of\nenjoyment in the progress of the game.Many and many a night in the bare\nlittle back room at Miss Crane\'s, Eliphalet had gloated over the very\nevent which was now come to pass.Not a step of the way but what he had\nlived through before.The future is laid open to such men as he.Since he had first seen the\nblack cloud of war rolling up from the South, a hundred times had he\nrehearsed the scene with Colonel Carvel which had actually taken place\na week before.A hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for\nthis first appearance in public with Virginia after he had forced the\nright to walk in her company.The words he had prepared--commonplace, to\nbe sure, but carefully chosen--flowed from his lips in a continual nasal\nstream.The girl answered absently, her feminine instinct groping after\na reason for it all.She brightened when she saw her father at the\ndoors and, saying good by to Eugenie, tripped up the steps, bowing to\nEliphalet coldly."Why, bless us, Jinny," said the Colonel, "you haven\'t been parading the\ntown in that costume!You\'ll have us in Lynch\'s slave pen by to-morrow\nnight.laughed he, patting her under the chin, "there\'s no\ndoubt about your sentiments, anyhow.""I\'ve been over to Puss Russell\'s house," said she, breathless."They\'ve\nclosed it up, you know--" (He nodded.)"And then we went--Eugenie and I,\nto headquarters, just to see what the Yankees would do.""You must take care, honey,"\nhe said, lowering his voice."They suspect me now of communicating with\nthe Governor and McCulloch.Jinny, it\'s all very well to be brave, and\nto stand by your colors.But this sort of thing," said he, stroking the\ngown, "this sort of thing doesn\'t help the South, my dear, and only\nsets spies upon us.Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes\nstanding in the alley last night for three hours.""Pa," cried the girl, "I\'m so sorry."Suddenly searching his face with\na swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and\nlined."Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must\nnot go off on any more trips.""It isn\'t the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant\nduties--Jinny--"\n\n"Yes?"The Colonel\'s eye had suddenly fallen on Mr.Hopper, who was still\nstanding at the bottom of the steps.He checked himself abruptly as\nEliphalet pulled off his hat,\n\n"Howdy, Colonel?"Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen\nby a presentiment.As she saw her father start down the steps, she\nyearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she\nknew not what.Then she heard the Colonel\'s voice, courteous and kindly\nas ever.And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor."Won\'t--won\'t you come in, Mr.Virginia started\n\n"I don\'t know but what I will, thank you, Colonel," he answered; easily."I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter."Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs.Gaining her room,\nshe shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her\nthere.The man\'s face had all at once become a terror.She threw herself\non the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still\nleering at her with a new confidence.Presently she grew calmer; rising,\nshe put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the\nstairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her.She had never been in\nfear of a man before.She hearkened over the banisters for his voice,\nheard it, and summoned all her courage.How cowardly she had been to\nleave her father alone with him.Colfax\nignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at\nthat lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory.It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed\nwhat it cost her.Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner,\nand gloated over that likewise.Not a turn or a quiver of the victim\'s\npain is missed by your beast of prey.The Colonel was gravely polite,\nbut preoccupied.Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a\nguest.Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would\nhave given it to a governor."Thank\'ee, Colonel, I don\'t smoke," he said, waving the bog away.Colfax flung herself out of the room.It was ten o\'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane\'s, and picked his\nway up the front steps where the boarders were gathered."The war doesn\'t seem to make any difference in your business, Mr.Hopper," his landlady remarked, "where have you been so late?""I happened round at Colonel Carvel\'s this afternoon, and stayed for tea\nwith \'em," he answered, striving to speak casually.Abner Reed\'s room later than usual that\nnight.THE SCOURGE OF WAR\n\n"Virginia," said Mrs.Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, "I\nam going back to Bellegarde today.I really cannot put up with such a\nperson as Comyn had here to tea last night."It is safe to say that she had never accurately\ngauged the force which Virginia\'s respect for her elders, and affection\nfor her aunt through Clarence, held in check.Now there had arisen in front of her a tall\nperson of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively.It was not\nwhat Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade.Colfax sank\ninto a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had\nthrust into her hand."There has been a battle at Wilson\'s Creek," said Virginia, in an\nemotionless voice."General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we\nshould be thankful.More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their\nway here.They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from\nSpringfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to\neat or drink.""At what time shall I order the carriage\nto take you to Bellegarde?"Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece\'s gown."Oh,\nlet me stay," she cried, "let me stay."As you please, Aunt Lillian," she answered."You know that you may\nalways stay here.I only beg of you one thing, that when you have\nanything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it\nbefore Pa."Oh, Jinny," sobbed the lady, in tears again, "how can you be so cruel\nat such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?"But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for\nColonel Carvel\'s house.All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and\nAunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which\nshe had long denied herself.At evening she went to the station at\nFourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed\nback by the soldiers, until the trains came in.Alas, the heavy basket\nwhich the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again.The first\nhundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were\nlaid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the\nnew House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have\ntheir hearts wrung.The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun\nreeked with white wash and paint.The miserable men lay on the hard\nfloor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle.Those were\nthe first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to\nappal us.Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed\non the field weeks before.Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she\ndeclared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an\nordeal.Carvel had to assist her to the\nwaiting-room.Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia\nbusy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price\'s army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed\neyes were following her every motion.His frontiersman\'s clothes,\nstained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body.At\nVirginia\'s bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh\nwater, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands.Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man\'s wound, and to prescribe\nsome of the broth from Virginia\'s basket.For the first time since the\nwar began something of happiness entered her breast.Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the\nquestions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged\nthe place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to\nwork in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have\nbeen seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down\nthe names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night\nwriting to them.They put a mattress under the Arkansan.Virginia did not leave him until\nhe had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken\nface.Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that\nrose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to\njoin her father and aunt in the carriage below.She felt that another little while\nin this heated, horrible place would drive her mad.She was almost at\nthe door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.An elderly lady in widow\'s black was kneeling beside a man groaning in\nmortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face.He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn.A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right\nband.Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity,\nthrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there.Her face the\ngirl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man.The sweetness of\nher voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning\nthat he might listen:\n\n"You have a wife?""A boy, ma\'am--born the week--before I came--away.""I shall write to your wife," said the lady, so gently that Virginia\ncould scarce hear, "and tell her that you are cared for.He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota.Then he\nadded, "God bless you, lady."Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them.The lady turned\nher face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes.Virginia felt them\nwet in her own.Nobility, character,\nefficiency,-all were written on that face.Nobility spoke in the large\nfeatures, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes.Virginia had\nseen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her."Doctor, could this man\'s life be saved if I took him to my home?"The surgeon got down beside her and took the man\'s pulse.For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head."He has\nfainted," he said.The surgeon\nsmiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of\namputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand,\na clear eye and brain, and a good heart.Brice," he said, "I shall be glad to get you permission\nto take him, but we must first make him worth the taking.He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and\nthen added, "We must have one more to help us.""I am afraid we must go, dear," he said, "your aunt is getting\nimpatient.""Won\'t you please go without me, Pa?""Perhaps I can be of\nsome use."The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went\naway.The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of\nastonishment.Brice\'s searching gaze that brought the color\nto the girl\'s, face."Thank you, my dear," she said simply.As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the\ncarriage, Colonel Carvel came back.For two reeking hours he stood\nagainst the newly plastered wall.Even he was surprised at the fortitude\nand skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly\ncut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough\nbandages.At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary\nsurgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to\nhim, his thanks to the two ladies.The work of her hands had sustained\nher while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.She went down the\nstairs on her father\'s arm, and out into the air.Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.she was saying, "God will reward you for this act.You have\ntaught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles."Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing.The\nmere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was\nfilled with a longing unutterable.It was not because Margaret Brice\nwas the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with\nhers--whom she saw in her dreams.And yet now some of Stephen\'s traits\nseemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation.Virginia had\nlabored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice\'s side doing His\nwork, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters.One brief\nsecond had been needful for the spell.The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished\nhim, and Mrs.Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and\nwatch by the sergeant\'s pallet.Virginia\'s eyes followed her up the\nstairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage.With\nher foot on the step Virginia paused."Pa," she said, "do you think it would be possible to get them to let us\ntake that Arkansan into our house?""Why, honey, I\'ll ask Brinsmade if you like," said the Colonel."Here he\ncomes now, and Anne."It was Virginia who put the question to him."My dear," replied that gentleman, patting her, "I would do anything\nin the world for you.I\'ll see General Fremont this very afternoon.Virginia," he added, soberly, "it is such acts as yours to-day that give\nus courage to live in these times.""Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men.It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on\nthe face of the commanding general when Mr.Brinsmade at length got to\nhim with her request.This was before the days when the wounded arrived\nby the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to\nthrow out of gear the workings of a great system.But the General, had\nhad his eye on Mr.Brinsmade, with dignity, "is a gentleman.When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.""Even to an enemy," the General put in, "By George, Brinsmade, unless I\nknew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself.Well, well,\nhe may have his Arkansan."Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not\nsay that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview\nhis Excellency, the Commander in-chief.It was like obtaining an\naudience with the Sultan or the Czar.Citizens who had been prominent\nin affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men\nlike Mr.Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows\nin one of the general\'s anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with\nbeardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain.The\nGeneral might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough.His European notions\nof uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter.He was\na royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a\nglittering guard.It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that\nthese simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of\nthing.That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less\nin communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all\ntheir lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two\nhours to mop their brows.On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette,\nyou discovered a good man and a patriot.It was far from being the\nGeneral\'s fault that Mr.Hopper and others made money in mules and\nworthless army blankets.Such things always have been, and always will\nbe unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep\nof security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword.We\nshall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army\nof comfortable size will save millions in the end.So much for Democracy\nwhen it becomes a catchword.The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the\nWestern Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women\nwho gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing.Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with\ntruth its doings.The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler\nhero than he was never under a man\'s hand.For the glory of generals\nfades beside his glory.Brice home from\nher trying day in the hospital.Stephen, just returned from drill\nat Verandah hall, met her at the door.She would not listen to his\nentreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the\nporch behind the house, where there was a little breeze."Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen," she said."It was\nwhile we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost\nhis arm.I hope we shall be allowed to have him here."It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow," she said."I saw\nthe--the flies around him.And as I got down beside him to fan them away\nI had such a queer sensation.I knew that some one was standing behind\nme, looking at me.Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the\nman, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get\nhelp.Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice.It was that Miss\nCarvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you\nbought Hester, and to whose party you once went.Do you remember that\nthey offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?""She is a wonderful creature," his mother continued.And wasn\'t it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to\nmake?They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them."The good\nlady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making.And, my dear, her\ncapability astonished me.One might have thought that she had always\nbeen a nurse.The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must\nit have been for her.After the operation was over, I followed her\ndownstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the\nbuilding, waiting for their carriage.I felt that I must say something\nto her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done.When I\nsaw her there, I scarcely knew what to say.It was then three o\'clock, and she had been working steadily in that\nplace since morning.I am sure she could not have borne it much longer.Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so\nwhen I took it, and she was very pale.Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such\npoliteness.He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked,\nand he brought a mattress for us.I have heard that his house is\nwatched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating\nwith the Confederate leaders."I hope they will not get into any trouble.""I hope not, mother," said Stephen.It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the\nIron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards\ndrawn up.On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen\ncaught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their\ncountrymen.Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands.The tears ran\non his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion.Judge Whipple, grim\nand silent, stood apart.But he uncovered his head with the others when\nthe train rolled in.Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes\nwere piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of\nCaptain Carl Richter.Far from the land of his birth, among those same oaks on Bloody Hill\nwhere brave Lyon fell, he had gladly given up his life for the new\ncountry and the new cause he had made his own.That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a\nhero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the\ngreat trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the\nbugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent,\nstepped out from behind the blue line of the troops.He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first\nof many to be laid on Richter\'s grave.And yet he had not filled it\nwith sadness.For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look\nupon his empty place without a pang.He missed the cheery songs and the\nearnest presence even more than he had thought.Carl Richter,--as his\nfather before him,--had lived for others.Both had sacrificed their\nbodies for a cause.One of them might be pictured as he trudged with\nFather Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering\nat sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr\'s ranks to drive the tyrant\nNapoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time,\nhis wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a\nthankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena.Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder\nman left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar.In\nCarl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred.His, too,\nhad been the sacrifice.Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate\nthat great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the\noppressed.THE LIST OF SIXTY\n\nOne chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black\nmud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window.Her eye was\ncaught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched\nover them.One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame.They were\npulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel.On the seat a\nman, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his\nfeeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a\nragged blanket.In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed\ndown in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware,\nlay a gaunt woman in the rain.Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the\nsurface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there.From such a picture the girl fled in tears.But the sight of it, and of\nothers like it, haunted her for weeks.Through those last dreary days of\nNovember, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and\nprosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes.The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been\nwritten.Still they came by the hundred, those families.The father of one, hale and strong when\nthey started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house.The walls\nof that house could tell many tales to wring the heart.Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities.He found\ntime, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his\ncorrespondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and\nmidnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already\novertaxed.All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains\nof articles once dear--a child\'s doll, a little rocking-chair, a \nprint that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit\nold clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention.Christmas\nwas drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth.And many of the wanderers\nwere unclothed and unfed.More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men.Louis to take charge of the Department,\nand the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care\nfor the refugees.A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and\nthe verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No."Inasmuch," said the General, "as the Secession army had driven these\npeople from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to\nsupport them."He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.Indignation was rife the day that order was published.Sixty prominent\n"disloyalists" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten\nthousand dollars."They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent," cried\nMr.Who were\nto be on this mysterious list of "Sixty"?That was the all-absorbing\nquestion of the town.It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous\nones.Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr.Addison Colfax\nlived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared\nwould break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries,\ngave her niece not a little amusement.For Virginia was human, and one\nmorning she went to her aunt\'s room to read this editorial from the\nnewspaper:-- "For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well\nto state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand\ndollar list.""Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when\nyou know that I am in a state of frenzy now?It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to\npay.We are the only women of importance in the city."That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to\nBellegarde.Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were\nleft in the big house.Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been\nhired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running,\nlong-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell.Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or\npacing the floor restlessly.He was observed\nnight and day by Federal detectives.Virginia strove to amuse him, to\nconceal her anxiety as she watched him.Well she knew that but for her\nhe would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of\nthe night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go.Ten years\nhad seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of\nChristmas eves past and gone of her father\'s early home-coming from the\nstore, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily\ninto the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson.The\nCaptain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he\nwould confide to Ned with a knowing wink.And then the house would be\nlighted from top to bottom, and Mr.Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr.Carvel over great bowls of\napple toddy and egg-nog.And Virginia would have her own friends in the\nbig parlor.That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his\nChristmas dinner at Colonel Carvel\'s house.Brice\'s little table, and wondered whether he would miss\nthem as much as they missed him.War may break friendships, but it\ncannot take away the sacredness of memories.The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood\nlooking out of the sitting-room window.A man\'s figure muffled in\na greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes.It was the same United States deputy marshal she had\nseen the day before at Mr."Pa," she cried, "do you think he is coming here?""Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room.I could not bear to see them take that.Let me put\nit in the garret."The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.We must leave this house just as it is."Then he added,\nstrangely enough for him, "God\'s will be done."And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with\nhis apron on."Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?"The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself.He was an imposing\nfigure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy.Virginia\'s first impulse was to shrink under the stairs.Then she came\nout and stood beside her father.He was a young man with a smooth face, and\na frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia.He did not appear\nto relish the duty thrust upon him.He fumbled in his coat and drew from\nhis inner pocket a paper."Colonel Carvel," said he, "by order of Major General Halleck, I serve\nyou with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars\nfor the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven\nfrom their homes.In default of payment within a reasonable time such\npersonal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will\nsatisfy the demand against you.""You may tell the\nGeneral that the articles may be seized.That I will not, while in my\nright mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me."It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to\ndinner.He had gone into many houses that week;\nhad seen indignation, hysterics, frenzy.He had even heard men and women\nwhose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their\nloyalty to the Union.But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl\nwho had stood silent beside them, were new.He bowed, and casting his\neyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully\npulled his goatee, and laughed gently."Lordy, we haven\'t got three\nhundred and fifty dollars to our names," said he.That fierce valley of the\nMissouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is\nsometimes quiet.Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet\nmelts, and windows are opened.In those days the streets will be fetlock\ndeep in soft mud.It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor\nanything.It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van,\naccompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States\nPolice, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr.Eugenie,\nwatching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who\ncame out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his\nFrench ancestors.Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply\nfilling its place.Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance\nhard to describe sat on her honest black face.I \'low you knows dat jes as well as me."An embarrassed\nsilence, and then from Mammy, "Whaffor you laffin at?""Now I reckon you knows dat he ain\'t.Ef he was, you ain\'t come here\n\'quirin\' in dat honey voice.""You tink I\ndunno whaffor you come?You done come heah to rifle, an\' to loot, an\'\nto steal, an\' to seize what ain\'t your\'n.You come heah when young Marse\nain\'t to home ter rob him.""Ned, whaffor you hidin\'\nyonder?Ef yo\' ain\'t man to protect Marse Comyn\'s prop-ty, jes han\' over\nMarse Comyn\'s gun."The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled\nby this unexpected resistance.Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it\nwas evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort."Who is\nyou to come heah \'quiring fo\' her!I ain\'t agwine--"\n\n"Mammy!"Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at\nher bandanna."Mammy, what is all this noise about?""These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f\'r t\' carry away all yo\' pa\'s\nblongin\'s.I jes\' tol\' \'em dey ain\'t comin\' in ovah dis heah body."He caught sight of the face of\nMiss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly."I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma\'am, to seize\npersonal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel."Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back."I do not see how\nI am to prevent you," she said.I--I can\'t tell you how sorry I am.Then he\nentered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around\nhim."I expect all that we want is right here," he said.And at the sight of\nthe great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled.Then he\nwalked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany\nstool, and ran his fingers over the keys.They seemed to Virginia,\nstanding motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.The piano, too, had been her mother\'s.It had once stood in the brick\nhouse of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale.The songs of Beatrice\nlay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by.No more, of an evening\nwhen they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play\nthem over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his\ncigar,--dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl\nwho held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his\nside.And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had\nplayed them for him on this piano.Often he had told Virginia of those\ndays, and walked with her over those paths.The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck.For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter."Come along upstairs wid yo\' Mammy, honey.Dis ain\'t no place for us,\nI reckon."Her words were the essence of endearment.And yet, while she\npronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders."Oh, de good\nLawd\'ll burn de wicked!"Virginia went back into the room\nand stood before the deputy."Isn\'t there something else you could take?"I have a necklace--"\n\n"No, miss.And there ain\'t nothing quite\nso salable as pianos."She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away.Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia\'s breast, and\nthat was because there was a pain in her own.They took the rosewood\nwhat-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could\ntouch them, and held them in her arms.They seized the mahogany\nvelvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle\'s wedding present to her mother; and,\nlast of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near\nthe spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children\'s\nparties.She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone.Ned closed the blinds once\nmore, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the\nstairs.CHAPTER V. THE AUCTION\n\n"Stephen," said the Judge, in his abrupt way, "there isn\'t a great deal\ndoing.Let\'s go over to the Secesh property sales."The seizures and intended sale of\nsecession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in\nthe city.There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as\nunjust and brutal.The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may\nonly be surmised.Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any\ngoods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day\nbecause it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember\nit.It was not that Stephen feared ostracism.Anne Brinsmade was almost the\nonly girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances.The Misses Russell showed him very\nplainly that they disapproved of his politics.The hospitable days at\nthat house were over.Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street,\npretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod.The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners,\nin sentiment against forced auctions.However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the\nJudge leaning on his arm."Stephen," said he, presently, "I guess I\'ll do a little bidding."And, if he really wished to bid,\nStephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him."You don\'t approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose," said the Judge."Then," said the Judge, tartly, "by bidding, we help to support starving\nUnion families.You should not be afraid to bid, sir.""I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple."He did not see the smile on the\nJudge\'s face."Then you will bid in certain things for me," said Mr.Here\nhe hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench."Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted.Now I\'ve got the\nchance to buy it cheap."There was silence again, for the space of a whole block.Finally,\nStephen managed to say:-- "You\'ll have to excuse me, sir.cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so\nthat a wagon nearly ran over his toes."I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel\'s house, sir.Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to\nsay these things.The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart.And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street,\nwhich was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of\nVirginia.He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through.He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had\nactually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with\nthe piano that she had played on.The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they\ncame to Morgan\'s great warerooms.A crowd blocked the pavement, and\nhustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and\nladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom\nthey spoke to.All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might\nsee for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor\'s\nhousehold goods.The long hall, which ran from street to street, was\npacked, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly\nagainst the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing\nall in a breath.The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way\nfiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a\nsecession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.In truth,\nit was at the Judge\'s suggestion that a blue provost\'s guard was called\nin later to protect the seized property.How many of those mahogany pieces, so ruthlessly tumbled about before\nthe public eye, meant a heartache!Wedding presents of long ago, dear to\nmany a bride with silvered hair, had been torn from the corner where the\nchildren had played--children who now, alas, were grown and gone to war.Yes, that was the Brussels rug that had lain before the fire, and which\nthe little feet had worn in the corner.Those were the chairs the little\nhands had harnessed, four in a row, and fallen on its side was the\narmchair--the stage coach itself.There were the books, held up to\ncommon gaze, that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection.Yes, and\nhere in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family\ncarriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the\nhappy brood of children, now scattered and gone to war.As Stephen reached his place beside the Judge, Mr.And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have\ndropped dead.The heavy dining-room table which meant so much to the\nfamily went for a song to a young man recently come from Yankeeland,\nwhose open boast it was--like Eliphalet\'s secret one--that he would one\nday grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the Southern\naristocrats.Catherwood, his face\nhaggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her\nsilver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.Stephen looked in vain for Colonel Carvel--for Virginia.He did not want\nto see them there.He knew by heart the list of things which had been\ntaken from their house.He understood the feeling which had sent the\nJudge here to bid them in.When the auctioneer came to the Carvel list, and the well-known name was\nshouted out, the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the\nstand.And murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction."Now, gentlemen, and ladies," said the seller, "this here is a genuine\nEnglish Rothfield piano once belonging to Colonel Carvel, and the\ncelebrated Judge Colfax of Kaintucky."He lingered fondly over the\nnames, that the impression might have time to sink deep."This here\nmagnificent instrument\'s worth at the very least" (another pause)\n"twelve hundred dollars.He struck a base note of the keys, then a treble, and they vibrated\nin the heated air of the big hall.Had he hit the little C of the top\noctave, the tinkle of that also might have been heard."Gentlemen and ladies, we have to begin somewheres.A menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence.Some there were\nwho gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no intention\nof committing social suicide.Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which\npenetrated to St.The owner was\na seedy man with a straw-, drunkard\'s mustache.He was leaning\nagainst the body of Mrs.Russell\'s barouche (seized for sale), and those\nabout him shrank away as from smallpox.His hundred-dollar offer was\nfollowed by a hiss.When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a\nwarning to those that knew him.As he doubled the bid, the words came\nout with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life\nhas been used to opposition.He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed\nhimself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to\nthe floor.And this is how Judge Whipple braved public opinion once more.As he\nstood there, defiant, many were the conjectures as to what he could wish\nto do with the piano of his old friend.Those who knew the Judge (and\nthere were few who did not) pictured to themselves the dingy little\napartment where he lived, and smiled.Whatever his detractors might have\nsaid of him, no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold\nanything for gain.Could it have been of admiration for\nthe fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him?"Give me a strong and consistent enemy," some great personage has said,\n"rather than a lukewarm friend."Three score and five years the Judge\nhad lived, and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart.But it was let out to many more\nthat day, and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his\nname with bitterness.Before he of the yellow mustache could pick up\nhis cigar from the floor and make another bid, the Judge had cried out\na sum which was the total of Colonel Carvel\'s assessment.Many recall\nto this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth\nof itself; and when he turned to go they made a path for him, in\nadmiration, the length of the hall, down which he stalked, looking\nneither to the right nor left.Stephen followed him, thankful for the\nday which had brought him into the service of such a man.And so it came about that the other articles were returned to Colonel\nCarvel with the marshal\'s compliments, and put back into the cold parlor\nwhere they had stood for many years.The men who brought them offered to\nput down the carpet, but by Virginia\'s orders the rolls were stood up in\nthe corner, and the floor left bare.And days passed into weeks, and no\nsign or message came from Judge Whipple in regard to the piano he had\nbought.Virginia did not dare mention it to the Colonel.It had been carried by six sweating <DW64>s up the\nnarrow stairs into the Judge\'s office.Whipple\'s orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of\npapers and books and rubbish, and there the bulky instrument was finally\nset up.The Judge watched the\nproceeding grimly, choking now and again from the dust that was raised,\nyet uttering never a word.He locked the lid when the van man handed him\nthe key, and thrust that in his pocket.Stephen had of late found enough to do in St.He was the kind of\nman to whom promotions came unsought, and without noise.In the autumn\nhe had been made a captain in the Halleck Guards of the State Militia,\nas a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge\nof tactics.Twice his company had been called out at night, and once\nthey made a campaign as far as the Merimec and captured a party of\nrecruits who were destined for Jefferson Davis.Brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit, and yet scarcely\na day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital.For\nStephen helped in the work of the Sanitary Commission too, and so strove\nto make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give.Brinsmade moved out to their place on the\nBellefontaine Road.This was to force Anne to take a rest.For the\ngirl was worn out with watching at the hospitals, and with tending\nthe destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees.The\nBrinsmade place was not far from the Fair Grounds,--now a receiving\ncamp for the crude but eager regiments of the Northern states.Brinsmade\'s, when the day\'s duty was done, the young Union officers\nused to ride, and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea.That\nhouse, and other great houses on the Bellefontaine Road with which this\nhistory has no occasion to deal, were as homes to many a poor fellow who\nwould never see home again.Sometimes Anne would gather together such\nyoung ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as\ntheir interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a Union officer,\nand there would be a little dance.To these dances Stephen Brice was\nusually invited.One such occasion occurred on a Friday in January, and Mr.Brinsmade\nhimself called in his buggy and drove Stephen to the country early in\nthe afternoon.He and Anne went for a walk along the river, the surface\nof which was broken by lumps of yellow ice.Gray clouds hung low in the\nsky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed\nfields.The grass was all a yellow-brown, but the north wind which\nswayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to Anne\'s cheeks.Before\nthey realized where they were, they had nearly crossed the Bellegarde\nestate, and the house itself was come into view, standing high on the\n<DW72> above the withered garden."The shutters are up," said Stephen.Colfax had\ncome out here not long a--"\n\n"She came out for a day just before Christina," said Anne, smiling, "and\nthen she ran off to Kentucky.I think she was afraid that she was one of\nthe two women on the list of Sixty.""It must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not,"\nsaid Stephen, who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain\nSunday not a year gone.Impelled by the same inclination, they walked in silence to the house\nand sat down on the edge of the porch.The only motion in the view was\nthe smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind, and the hurrying\nice in the stream.said Anne, with a sigh, "how she loved to romp!What good\ntimes we used to have here together!"But you could not make her show\nit.The other morning when she came out to our house I found her sitting\nat the piano.I am sure there were tears in her eyes, but she would not\nlet me see them.She made some joke about Spencer Catherwood running\naway.What do you think the Judge will do with that piano, Stephen?""The day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black\ncloth, which he spread over it.And Anne, turning to him timidly, gave him a long,\nsearching look."I think that we ought to go back."They went out by the long entrance road, through the naked woods.Only a little while before he had had one of those\nvivid dreams of Virginia which left their impression, but not their\nsubstance, to haunt him.On those rare days following the dreams her\nspirit had its mastery over his.He pictured her then with a glow on her\nface which was neither sadness nor mirth,--a glow that ministered to\nhim alone.And yet, he did not dare to think that he might have won her,\neven if politics and war had not divided them.When the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening, Stephen\nstood at the door of the long room, meditatively watching the bright\ngowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past.Presently the opposite door opened, and he heard Mr.Brinsmade\'s voice\nmingling with another, the excitable energy of which recalled some\nfamiliar episode.Almost--so it seemed--at one motion, the owner of the\nvoice had come out of the door and had seized Stephen\'s hand in a warm\ngrasp,--a tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer.The\nmilitary frock, which fitted the man\'s character rather than the man,\nwas carelessly open, laying bare a gold-buttoned white waistcoat and an\nexpanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie.The ends of the\ncollar were apart the width of the red clipped beard, and the mustache\nwas cropped straight along the line of the upper lip.The forehead rose\nhigh, and was brushed carelessly free of the hair.The nose was almost\nstraight, but combative."The boy doesn\'t remember me," said the gentleman, in quick tones,\nsmiling at Mr."Yes, sir, I do," Stephen made haste to answer.He glanced at the star\non the shoulder strap, and said."Now in command at Camp Benton, Stephen," Mr."Won\'t\nyou sit down, General?""No," said the General, emphatically waving away the chair.Then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusement,--and\nmischief, Stephen thought."So you\'ve heard of me since we met, sir?"Guess you heard I was crazy," said the General, in his downright\nway."He\'s been reading the lies in the newspapers too, Brinsmade," the\nGeneral went on rapidly."I\'ll make \'em eat their newspapers for saying\nI was crazy.That\'s the Secretary of War\'s doings.Ever tell you what\nCameron did, Brinsmade?He and his party were in Louisville last fall,\nwhen I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my room in the Galt House.Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine,\nAfter lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over.He\nasked me what I thought about things in Kentucky.Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the\nPotomac to Kansas.Here\'s McClellan in the East with one hundred miles\nof front.Here\'s Fremont in the West with one hundred miles.Here we\nare in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend.McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand.You\ngive us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.\'\'Two hundred\nthousand before we get through,\' said I. Cameron pitched up his hands\nin the air.says he, \'where are they to come from?\'\'The\nnorthwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won\'t\naccept,\' said I.Secretary, you\'ll need \'em all and\nmore before we get done with this Rebellion.\'Well, sir, he was very\nfriendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed\nout.he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I\'m\ncrazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky.Then I am ordered\nto report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia\nbecause he believes the lies."Stephen, who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two\nbefore, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at the man in\nfront of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who\ntook his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could\nbelieve them."They have to print something, General," he said."I\'ll give \'em something to print later on," answered the General,\ngrimly."Brinsmade, you fellows did have\na session with Fremont, didn\'t you?Anderson sent me over here last\nSeptember, and the first man I ran across at the Planters\' House was\nAppleton. \'\'To see Fremont,\'\nI said.\'You don\'t think\nFremont\'ll see you, do you?\'\'Well,\' says Tom, \'go\n\'round to his palace at six to-morrow morning and bribe that Hungarian\nprince who runs his body-guard to get you a good place in the line of\nsenators and governors and first citizens, and before nightfall you\nmay get a sight of him, since you come from Anderson.Not one man in\na hundred,\' says Appleton, I not one man in a hundred, reaches his\nchief-of-staff.\'Next morning," the General continued in a staccato\nwhich was often his habit, "had breakfast before daybreak and went\n\'round there.Place just swarming with Californians--army contracts."More\nCalifornians, and by gad--old Baron Steinberger with his nose hanging\nover the register.""Fremont was a little difficult to get at, General," said Mr."Things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were\nawarded.Fremont was a good man, and it wasn\'t his fault that the\ninexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get\nrich."To be sure\nhe was--didn\'t get along with Blair.These court-martials you\'re having\nhere now have stirred up the whole country.I guess we\'ll hear now how\nthose fortunes were made.To listen to those witnesses lie about each\nother on the stand is better than the theatre."Stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the General set\nthis matter forth.He himself had been present one day of the sittings\nof the court-martial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules\nwas that same seedy man with the straw- mustache who had bid for\nVirginia\'s piano against the Judge."Come, Stephen," said the General, abruptly, "run and snatch one of\nthose pretty girls from my officers."They deserve more, sir," answered Stephen.Whereupon the General laid\nhis hand impulsively on the young man\'s shoulder, divining what Stephen\ndid not say.said be; "you are doing the work in this war, not we.We\ndo the damage--you repair it.Brinsmade and you\ngentlemen who help him, where would our Western armies be?Don\'t you\ngo to the front yet a while, young man.We need the best we have\nin reserve.""You\'ve had military\ntraining of some sort?""He\'s a captain in the Halleck Guards, sir," said Mr.Brinsmade,\ngenerously, "and the best drillmaster we\'ve had in this city.He\'s seen\nservice, too, General."Stephen reddened furiously and started to protest, when the General\ncried:-- "It\'s more than I have in this war.Come, come, I knew he was a\nsoldier.Let\'s see what kind of a strategist he\'ll make.Brinsmade, have\nyou got such a thing as a map?"Brinsmade had, and led the way back\ninto the library.The General shut the door, lighted a cigar with a\nsingle vigorous stroke of a match, and began to smoke with quick puffs.Stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the General was\ngiving out with such freedom.When the map was laid on the table, the General drew a pencil from his\npocket and pointed to the state of Kentucky.Then he drew a line from\nColumbus to Bowling Green, through Forts Donelson and Henry."Now, Stephen," said he, "there\'s the Rebel line.Show me the proper\nplace to break it."Stephen hesitated a while, and then pointed at the centre.He drew a heavy line across the\nfirst, and it ran almost in the bed of the Tennessee River."Very question Halleck asked me the other day, and that\'s\nhow I answered it.Now, gentlemen, there\'s a man named Grant down in\nthat part of the country.Ever heard of him,\nBrinsmade?He used to live here once, and a year ago he was less than I\nwas.The recollection of the scene in the street by the Arsenal that May\nmorning not a year gone came to Stephen with a shock."I saw him," he cried; "he was Captain Grant that lived on the Gravois\nRoad.But surely this can\'t be the same man who seized Paducah and was\nin that affair at Belmont."They kicked him around Springfield awhile, after\nthe war broke out, for a military carpet-bagger.Then they gave him for\na regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on.He made \'em march halfway across the\nstate instead of taking the cars the Governor offered.I guess\nhe is the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont.Then his boys broke\nloose when they got into the town.The Rebs\ncame back and chased \'em out into their boats on the river.Brinsmade,\nyou remember hearing about that."Grant did the coolest thing you ever saw.He sat on his horse at the\ntop of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on\nthe boat.Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a\ncigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him.And then, sir,"\ncried the General, excitedly, "what do you think he did?Hanged if he\ndidn\'t force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole\nlength of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the\nsteamer.And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared.They were so\nastonished they didn\'t even shoot the man."And now, Stephen," he added, "just you run off and take hold\nof the prettiest girl you can find.If any of my boys object, say I sent\nyou."It was little Tiefel, now a first\nlieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face, come to town on a few\ndays\' furlough.He had been with Lyon at Wilson\'s Creek, and he had\na sad story to tell of how he found poor Richter, lying stark on that\nbloody field, with a smile of peace upon his face.Strange that he\nshould at length have been killed by a sabre!It was a sad meeting for those two, since each reminded the other of\na dear friend they would see no more on earth.They went out to sup\ntogether in the German style; and gradually, over his beer, Tiefel\nforgot his sorrow.Stephen listened with an ache to the little man\'s\ntales of the campaigns he had been through.So that presently Tiefel\ncried out:\n\n"Why, my friend, you are melancholy as an owl."He is no more crazy than I am," said Stephen, warmly--\n\n"Is he not?"answered Tiefel, "then I will show you a mistake.You\nrecall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there,\nand he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered.Now up\ngets your General Sherman in the middle of the night,--midnight,--and\nmarches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms.So, says\nhe, \'land so,\' says he, \'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here,\nand this column will take that road, and so-and-so\'s a damned fool.So he walks up and down for three eternal hours.Says\nhe, \'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at\nSedalia with his regiments all over the place.They must both go into\ncamp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops\nmay be handled.\'""If that\'s insanity," cried Stephen so strongly as to surprise the\nlittle man; "then I wish we had more insane generals.It just shows\nhow a malicious rumor will spread.What Sherman said about Pope\'s and\nSteele\'s forces is true as Gospel, and if you ever took the trouble to\nlook into that situation, Tiefel, you would see it."And Stephen brought\ndown his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump.It was not a month after that that Sherman\'s prophecy of the quiet\ngeneral who had slid down the bluff at Belmont came true.The whole\ncountry bummed with Grant\'s praises.Moving with great swiftness and\nsecrecy up the Tennessee, in company with the gunboats of Commodore\nFoote, he had pierced the Confederate line at the very point Sherman\nhad indicated.Fort Henry had fallen, and Grant was even then moving to\nbesiege Donelson.Brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield, taking with\nhim too Paducah physicians and nurses.All day long the boat was loading\nwith sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded.It was muggy\nand wet--characteristic of that winter--as Stephen pushed through the\ndrays on the slippery levee to the landing.He had with him a basket his mother had put up.Brinsmade from the Judge It was while he was picking his way\nalong the crowded decks that he ran into General Sherman.The General\nseized him unceremoniously by the shoulder."Good-by, Stephen," he said."Good-by, General," said Stephen, shifting his basket to shake hands."Ordered to Paducah," said the General.He pulled Stephen off the guards\ninto an empty cabin."Brice," said he, earnestly, "I haven\'t forgotten\nhow you saved young Brinsmade at Camp Jackson.They tell me that you are\nuseful here.I say, don\'t go in unless you have to.I don\'t mean force,\nyou understand.But when you feel that you can go in, come to me or\nwrite me a letter.That is," he added, seemingly inspecting Stephen\'s\nwhite teeth with approbation, "if you\'re not afraid to serve under a\ncrazy man."It has been said that the General liked the lack of effusiveness of\nStephen\'s reply.ELIPHALET PLAYS HIS TRUMPS\n\nSummer was come again.Through interminable days, the sun beat down upon\nthe city; and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat\nwith which he had filled them.Great battles had been fought, and vast\narmies were drawing breath for greater ones to come."Jinny," said the Colonel one day, "as we don\'t seem to be much use in\ntown, I reckon we may as well go to Glencoe."Virginia, threw her arms around her father\'s neck.For many months\nshe had seen what the Colonel himself was slow to comprehend--that his\nusefulness was gone.The days melted into weeks, and Sterling Price and\nhis army of liberation failed to come.The vigilant Union general and\nhis aides had long since closed all avenues to the South.For, one fine\nmorning toward the end of the previous summer, when the Colonel was\ncontemplating a journey, he had read that none might leave the city\nwithout a pass, whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the Provost\nMarshal.There he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight,\neach waving a pass made out by the Provost Marshal\'s clerks, and waiting\nfor that officer\'s signature.The Colonel also procured one of these,\nand fell into line.The Marshal gazed at the crowd, pulled off his coat,\nand readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east.Bub Ballington, whom the Colonel knew, but pretended not\nto."Not very profitable to be a minute-man, eh?"Ballington trying not to look indignant\nas he makes for the door.A small silver bell rings on the Marshal\'s\ndesk, the one word: "Spot!"breaks the intense silence, which is one way\nof saying that Mr.Ballington is detained, and will probably be lodged\nthat night at Government expense."Well, Colonel Carvel, what can I do for you this morning?"asked the\nMarshal, genially.The Colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow."I reckon I\'ll wait\ntill next week, Captain," said Mr."It\'s pretty hot to travel\njust now."There were many in the office who\nwould have liked to laugh, but it did not pay to laugh at some people.In the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable\nthan ever.All who were convicted by a court-martial of being rebels\nwere to have property confiscated, and slaves set free.Then there was\na certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have\nguardians appointed over their actions.There were many who swallowed\nthis oath and never felt any ill effects.Jacob Cluyme was one, and\ncame away feeling very virtuous.Hopper did not have indigestion after taking it, but\nColonel Carvel would sooner have eaten, gooseberry pie, which he had\nnever tasted but once.That summer had worn away, like a monster which turns and gives hot\ngasps when you think it has expired.It took the Arkansan just a month,\nunder Virginia\'s care, to become well enough to be sent to a Northern\nprison He was not precisely a Southern gentleman, and he went to sleep\nover the "Idylls of the King."But he was admiring, and grateful, and\nwept when he went off to the boat with the provost\'s guard, destined\nfor a Northern prison.He had taken her away from\nher aunt (who would have nothing to do with him), and had given her\noccupation.She nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of\nPrice\'s rough army.His departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set.The\nfavor had caused comment and trouble, hence there was no hope of giving\nanother sufferer the same comfort.One of\nthe mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of Colonel\nCarvel\'s house was arrested on the ferry, but he had contrived to be rid\nof the carpet-sack in which certain precious letters were carried.Hopper\'s visits to Locust Street had\ncontinued at intervals of painful regularity.It is not necessary to\ndwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation, nor to repeat the\nplatitudes which he repeated, for there was no significance in Mr.The Colonel had found that out, and was\nthankful.His manners were better; his English decidedly better.It was for her father\'s sake, of course, that Virginia bore with\nhim.She tried to be just, and it\noccurred to her that she had never before been just.Again and again she\nrepeated to herself that Eliphalet\'s devotion to the Colonel at this\nlow ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect\nhim.Hopper as an uneducated Yankee\nand a person of commercial ideals.But now he was showing virtues,--if\nvirtues they were,--and she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.With his great shrewdness and business ability, why did he not take\nadvantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune?For Virginia had of late been going to the store with the Colonel,--who\nspent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers, and Mr.Hopper\nhad always been at his desk.After this, Virginia even strove to be kind to him, but it was uphill\nwork.The front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion\nwas not left behind.Could it be that\nthere was a motive under all this plotting?He struck her inevitably as\nthe kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end.The\nworst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself\nnow, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner\nin Mr.She had put even this away as unworthy of her.Once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject."I believe I did him an injustice, Pa," she said."Not that I like him\nany better now.But I do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as I thought, he\nwould have deserted you long ago for something more profitable.He would\nnot be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business\nwhen the war is over."She remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper."You are a good girl, Jinny," he said.Toward the end of July of that second summer riots broke out in the\ncity, and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on Virginia\'s horizon.This took the form, for Northerners, of a guerilla scare, and an order\nwas promptly issued for the enrollment of all the able-bodied men in the\nten wards as militia, subject to service in the state, to exterminate\nthe roving bands.Whereupon her Britannic Majesty became extremely\npopular,--even with some who claimed for a birthplace the Emerald Isle.Hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their British citizenship\nmade haste to renew their allegiance; and many sought the office of the\nEnglish Consul whose claims on her Majesty\'s protection were vague, to\nsay the least.For the first time,\nwhen Virginia walked to the store with her father, Eliphalet was not\nthere."I don\'t blame him for not wanting to fight for the Yankees," she said."Then why doesn\'t he fight for the South he asked"\n\n"Fight for the South!""I reckon not, too," said the Colonel, dryly.For the following week curiosity prompted Virginia to take that walk\nwith the Colonel.Hopper being still absent, she helped him to sort\nthe papers--those grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone\nby.Carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some\nincident to his mind; for he would drop it absently on his desk, his\nhand seeking his chin, and remain for half an hour lost in thought.The Colonel answered\nthem all truthfully--generally with that dangerous suavity for which he\nwas noted.Twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in\nto ask Eliphalet\'s whereabouts.On the second occasion this individual\nbecame importunate."You don\'t know nothin\' about him, you say?""I \'low I kin \'lighten you a little.""Good day, sir," said the Colonel."I guess you\'ll like to hear what I\'ve got to say."Carvel in his natural voice, "show this man out."Ford slunk out without Ephum\'s assistance.But he half turned at the\ndoor, and shot back a look that frightened Virginia."Oh, Pa," she cried, in alarm, "what did he mean?""I couldn\'t tell you, Jinny," he answered.But she noticed that he was\nvery thoughtful as they walked home.The next morning Eliphalet had not\nreturned, but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for\nhim.The Colonel read the order, and invited them in with hospitality.He even showed them the way upstairs, and presently Virginia heard them\nall tramping overhead among the bales.Her eye fell upon the paper they\nhad brought, which lay unfolded on her father\'s desk.It was signed\nStephen A. Brice, Enrolling Officer.That very afternoon they moved to Glencoe, and Ephum was left in sole\ncharge of the store.At Glencoe, far from the hot city and the cruel\nwar, began a routine of peace.Virginia was a child again, romping\nin the woods and fields beside her father.The color came back to her\ncheeks once more, and the laughter into her voice.The two of them, and\nNed and Mammy, spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom\nof which Dick had known so long, before the old horse was caught and\nbrought back into bondage.After that Virginia took long drives with her\nfather, and coming home, they would sit in the summer house high above\nthe Merimec, listening to the crickets\' chirp, and watching the day fade\nupon the water.The Colonel, who had always detested pipes, learned to\nsmoke a corncob.He would sit by the hour, with his feet on the rail of\nthe porch and his hat tilted back, while Virginia read to him.Poe\nand Wordsworth and Scott he liked, but Tennyson was his favorite.One afternoon when Virginia was sitting in the summer house alone, her\nthoughts wandering back, as they sometimes did, to another afternoon\nshe had spent there,--it seemed so long ago,--when she saw Mammy Easter\ncoming toward her."Honey, dey\'s comp\'ny up to de house.He\'s\non de porch, talkin\' to your Pa.In truth, the solid figure of Eliphalet himself was on the path some\ntwenty yards behind her.His hat was in his hand; his hair was plastered\ndown more neatly than ever, and his coat was a faultless and sober\ncreation of a Franklin Avenue tailor.He carried a cane, which was\nunheard of.Virginia sat upright, and patted her skirts with a gesture\nof annoyance--what she felt was anger, resentment.Suddenly she rose,\nswept past Mammy, and met him ten paces from the summer house."How-dy-do, Miss Virginia," he cried pleasantly."Your father had a\nnotion you might be here."Her greeting would have frozen a man\nof ardent temperament.But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet\nshowed.There was something in\nthe man\'s air to-day.Her words seemed to relieve some tension in him."Well, I did, first of all.You\'re considerable smart, Miss Jinny, but\nI\'ll bet you can\'t tell me where I was, now.""I cal\'lated it might interest you to know\nhow I dodged the Sovereign State of Missouri.General Halleck made an\norder that released a man from enrolling on payment of ten dollars.Then I was drafted into the Abe Lincoln Volunteers; I paid a\nsubstitute.And so here I be, exercising life, and liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness.""If your substitute gets\nkilled, I suppose you will have cause for congratulation."Eliphalet laughed, and pulled down his cuffs."That\'s his lookout,\nI cal\'late," said he.He glanced at the girl in a way that made her\nvaguely uneasy.She turned from him, back toward the summer house.Eliphalet\'s eyes smouldered as they rested upon her figure."I\'ve heard considerable about the beauties of this place.Would you\nmind showing me \'round a bit?"Not since that first evening in Locust Street had it taken on such\nassurance, And yet she could not be impolite to a guest."Certainly not," she replied, but without looking up.He came to the summer house, glanced around it with apparent\nsatisfaction, and put his foot on the moss-grown step.She leaped quickly into the doorway before him, and\nstood facing him, framed in the climbing roses.He drew back,\nstaring in astonishment at the crimson in her face.She had been groping\nwildly for excuses, and found none."Because," she said, "because I ask you not to."With dignity: "That\nshould be sufficient.""Well," replied Eliphalet, with an abortive laugh, "that\'s funny, now.Womenkind get queer notions, which I cal\'late we\'ve got to respect and\nput up with all our lives--eh?"Her anger flared at his leer and at his broad way of gratifying her\nwhim.And she was more incensed than ever at his air of being at\nhome--it was nothing less.She strove still to hide her\nresentment."There is a walk along the bluff," she said, coldly, "where the view is\njust as good."But she purposely drew him into the right-hand path, which led, after\na little, back to the house.Despite her pace he pressed forward to her\nside."Miss Jinny," said he, precipitately, "did I ever strike you as a\nmarrying man?"Virginia stopped, and put her handkerchief to her face, the impulse\nstrong upon her to laugh.Eliphalet was suddenly transformed again into\nthe common commercial Yankee.He was in love, and had come to ask her\nadvice."I never thought of you as of the marrying kind, Mr.Hopper," she\nanswered, her voice quivering.Indeed, he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease.The\nSunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across\nfrom the buttons; his face, fleshy and perspiring, showed purple veins,\nand the little eyes receded comically, like a pig\'s."Well, I\'ve been thinking serious of late about getting married," he\ncontinued, slashing the rose bushes with his stick."I don\'t cal\'late\nto be a sentimental critter.I\'m not much on high-sounding phrases, and\nsuch things, but I\'d give you my word I\'d make a good husband.""Please be careful of those roses, Mr."Beg pardon," said Eliphalet.He began to lose track of his tenses--that\nwas the only sign he gave of perturbation.Louis\nwithout a cent, Miss Jinny, I made up my mind I\'d be a rich man before\nI left it.If I was to die now, I\'d have kept that promise.I\'m not\nthirty-four, and I cal\'late I\'ve got as much money in a safe place as a\ngood many men you call rich.I\'m not saying what I\'ve got, mind you.I\'ve stopped chewing--there was a time when I\ndone that."That is all very commendable, Mr.Hopper," Virginia said, stifling a\nrebellious titter."But,--but why did you give up chewing?""I am informed that the ladies are against it," said Eliphalet,--"dead\nagainst it.You wouldn\'t like it in a husband, now, would you?"This time the laugh was not to be put down."I confess I shouldn\'t," she\nsaid."Thought so," he replied, as one versed.His tones took on a nasal\ntwang."Well, as I was saying, I\'ve about got ready to settle down, and\nI\'ve had my eye on the lady this seven years.""The lady," said Eliphalet, bluntly, "is you."He glanced at her\nbewildered face and went on rapidly: "You pleased me the first day I set\neyes on you in the store I said to myself, \'Hopper, there\'s the one for\nyou to marry.\'I\'m plain, but my folks was good people.I set to work\nright then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny.I\'m a plain business man with no frills.You\'re the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury.You\'ll need a man\nwith a fortune, and a big one; you\'re the sort to show it off.I\'ve got\nthe foundations of that fortune, and the proof of it right here.And I\ntell you,"--his jaw was set,--"I tell you that some day Eliphalet Hopper\nwill be one of the richest men in the West."He had stopped, facing her in the middle of the way, his voice strong,\nhis confidence supreme.At first she had stared at him in dumb wonder.Then, as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue, astonishment\nwas still dominant,--sheer astonishment.But,\nas he finished, the thatch of the summer house caught her eye.A vision\narose of a man beside whom Eliphalet was not worthy to crawl.She\nthought of Stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset, and this\nproposal seemed a degradation.But she caught the look on Eliphalet\'s\nface, and she knew that he would not understand.This was one who\nrose and fell, who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried\nby--money.For a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes\nover the precipice, and shuddered.As for Eliphalet, let it not be\nthought that he had no passion.This was the moment for which he had\nlived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store.That type of face, that air,--these were the priceless things he would\nbuy with his money.Crazed with the very violence of his long-pent\ndesire, he seized her hand.He staggered back, and stood for a moment motionless, as though stunned.Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for\nmany a day."You--won\'t--marry me?"exclaimed Virginia, her face burning with\nthe shame of it.She was standing with her hands behind her, her back\nagainst a great walnut trunk, the crusted branches of which hung over\nthe bluff.Even as he looked at her, Eliphalet lost his head, and\nindiscretion entered his soul.You\'ve got no notion of my\nmoney, I say."If you owned the whole of\nCalifornia, I would not marry you."He\nslipped his hand into a pocket, as one used to such a motion, and drew\nout some papers."I cal\'late you ain\'t got much idea of the situation, Miss Carvel," he\nsaid; "the wheels have been a-turning lately.You\'re poor, but I guess\nyou don\'t know how poor you are,--eh?The Colonel\'s a man of honor,\nain\'t he?"For her life she could not have answered,--nor did she even know why she\nstayed to listen."Well," he said, "after all, there ain\'t much use in your lookin\' over\nthem papers.I\'ll tell you what they say: they\nsay that if I choose, I am Carvel & Company."The little eyes receded, and he waited a moment, seemingly to prolong a\nphysical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature."I cal\'late you despise me, don\'t you?"he went on, as if that, too,\ngave him pleasure."But I tell you the Colonel\'s a beggar but for me.All you\'ve got to do is to say you\'ll be my\nwife, and I tear these notes in two.(He\nmade the motion with his hands.)"Carvel & Company\'s an old firm,--a\nrespected firm.You wouldn\'t care to see it go out of the family, I\ncal\'late."But she did none of the things he expected.She said, simply:--"Will you please follow me, Mr.And he followed her,--his shrewdness gone, for once.Save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm.The path\nwound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in\nfront of the house.His\npipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards, and his head was bent\nforward, as though listening.When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,\nand went forward to meet them."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel\'s face.In one stride\nhe had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet\'s new coat, the other pointing\ndown the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you\'ll never get past it.Hopper\'s gait down the flagstones was\nan invention of his own.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,\nbut a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Singing\nin his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the\nstore,--the only time that the Colonel\'s bullet had gone wide.And down\nin the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,\nand feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once\noutside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him\nthat a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to\nlift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee\nthoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the\ncreases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him\nfrom her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look\ngrave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his\nshoulder, as of old."Yes--"\n\n"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through\nthe branches of the great trees, and a robin\'s note rose above the bass\nchorus of the frogs.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she\ncould hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we\'re just as poor as white\ntrash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him\nhave the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried."It shall be yours and\nmine together.And we shall live out here and be happy."He was in his familiar\nposture of thought, his legs slightly apart, his felt hat pushed back,\nstroking his goatee.But his clear gray eyes were troubled as they\nsought hers, and she put her hand to her breast."Virginia," he said, "I fought for my country once, and I reckon I\'m\nsome use yet awhile.It isn\'t right that I should idle here, while\nthe South needs me, Your Uncle Daniel is fifty-eight, and Colonel of a\nPennsylvania regiment.--Jinny, I have to go."It was in her blood as well as his.The Colonel\nhad left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay\nflowers on her grave.She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that\nhis heart was rent at leaving her.She put her hands on his shoulders,\nand he stooped to kiss her trembling lips.They walked out together to the summer-house, and stood watching the\nglory of the light on the western hills."Jinn," said the Colonel, "I\nreckon you will have to go to your Aunt Lillian.But I know that my girl can take care of herself.In case--in case I do\nnot come back, or occasion should arise, find Lige.Let him take you to\nyour Uncle Daniel.He is fond of you, and will be all alone in Calvert\nHouse when the war is over.And I reckon that is all I have to say.I\nwon\'t pry into your heart, honey.I\nlike the boy, and I believe he will quiet down into a good man."Virginia did not answer, but reached out for her father\'s hand and held\nits fingers locked tight in her own.From the kitchen the sound of Ned\'s\nvoice rose in the still evening air."Sposin\' I was to go to N\' Orleans an\' take sick and die,\n     Laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly."And after a while down the path the red and yellow of Mammy Easter\'s\nbandanna was seen.Laws, if I ain\'t ramshacked de premises fo\' you\nbof.De co\'n bread\'s gittin\' cold."That evening the Colonel and Virginia thrust a few things into her\nlittle leather bag they had chosen together in London.Virginia had\nfound a cigar, which she hid until they went down to the porch, and\nthere she gave it to him; when he lighted the match she saw that his\nhand shook.Half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate, and she heard\nhis firm tread die in the dust of the road.WITH THE ARMIES OF THE WEST\n\nWe are at Memphis,--for a while,--and the Christmas season is\napproaching once more.And yet we must remember that war recognizes no\nChristmas, nor Sunday, nor holiday.The brown river, excited by rains,\nwhirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay.Now the weather was\ncrisp and cold, now hazy and depressing, and again a downpour.A spirit possessed the place, a restless\nspirit called William T. Sherman.He prodded Memphis and laid violent\nhold of her.She groaned, protested, turned over, and woke up, peopled\nby a new people.When these walked, they ran, and they wore a blue\nuniform.Rain nor heat nor\ntempest kept them in.And yet they joked, and Memphis laughed (what was\nleft of her), and recognized a bond of fellowship.The General joked,\nand the Colonels and the Commissary and the doctors, down to the sutlers\nand teamsters and the salt tars under Porter, who cursed the dishwater\nMississippi, and also a man named Eads, who had built the new-fangled\niron boxes officially known as gunboats.The like of these had\nnever before been seen in the waters under the earth.The loyal\ncitizens--loyal to the South--had been given permission to leave the\ncity.The General told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses\nand slaves for the benefit of the Federal Government.Likewise he laid\ndown certain laws to the Memphis papers defining treason.He gave\nout his mind freely to that other army of occupation, the army of\nspeculation, that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton.The\nspeculators gave the Confederates gold, which they needed most, for the\nbales, which they could not use at all.The forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old Egypt under\nPharaoh--for whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than\ntheir descendants had in New Egypt for Grant or Sherman.And a certain acquaintance of ours\nmaterially added to his fortune by selling in Boston the cotton which\ncost him fourteen cents, at thirty cents.One day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came\nto a climax.Those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing,\nwere loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and\nmen,--men who came from every walk in life.Whistles bellowed, horses neighed.The gunboats chased hither and\nthither, and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with\nnaval precision, under the watchful eyes of a real admiral.Residents of Memphis from the river\'s bank watched the pillar of smoke\nfade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of Vicksburg.A little later he wrote to the\nCommander-in-Chief at Washington, "The valley of the Mississippi is\nAmerica."Vicksburg taken, this vast Confederacy would be chopped in two.Night fell to the music of the paddles, to the scent of the officers\'\ncigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of\nthe torches.Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted\ntwo hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in\nthe morning sun.Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America\'s\nhighway.When old Vick made his plantation on the Walnut Hills, he chose\na site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have\ndelighted in.Yes, there were the Walnut Hills, high bluffs separated from the\nMississippi by tangled streams and bayous, and on their crests the\nParrotts scowled.It was a queer Christmas Day indeed, bright and warm;\nno snow, no turkeys nor mince pies, no wine, but just hardtack and bacon\nand foaming brown water.On the morrow the ill-assorted fleet struggled up the sluggish Yazoo,\npast impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels, past\nlong-deserted cotton fields, until it came at last to the black ruins of\na home.It spread out by brigade\nand division and regiment and company, the men splashing and paddling\nthrough the Chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs.The Parrotts\nbegan to roar.A certain regiment, boldly led, crossed the bayou at a\nnarrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the\nbank was steepest.The fire from the battery scorched the hair of their\nheads.But there they stayed, scooping out the yellow clay with torn\nhands, while the Parrotts, with lowered muzzles, ploughed the <DW72> with\nshells.There they stayed, while the blue lines quivered and fell back\nthrough the forests on that short winter\'s afternoon, dragging their\nwounded from the stagnant waters.But many were left to die in agony in\nthe solitude.Like a tall emblem of energy, General Sherman stood watching the attack\nand repulse, his eyes ever alert.He paid no heed to the shells which\ntore the limbs from the trees about him, or sent the swamp water in\nthick spray over his staff.Now and again a sharp word broke from his\nlips, a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns."Sixth Missouri, General," said an aide, promptly.The General sat late in the Admiral\'s gunboat that night, but when\nhe returned to his cabin in the Forest Queen, he called for a list of\nofficers of the Sixth Missouri.His finger slipping down the roll paused\nat a name among the new second lieutenants."Yes, General, when it fell dark.""Let me see the casualties,--quick."That night a fog rolled up from the swamps, and in the morning\njack-staff was hid from pilot-house.Before the attack could be renewed,\na political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket\nfrom Washington, by virtue of which he took possession of the three army\ncore, and their chief, subpoenaed the fleet and the Admiral, and went\noff to capture Arkansas Post.Three weeks later, when the army was resting at Napoleon, Arkansas, a\nself-contained man, with a brown beard arrived from Memphis, and took\ncommand.He smoked incessantly in his\ncabin.He had look in his face that\nboded ill to any that might oppose him.Time and labor be counted\nas nothing, compared with the accomplishment of an object.Back to\nVicksburg paddled the fleet and transports.Across the river from the\ncity, on the pasty mud behind the levee\'s bank were dumped Sherman\'s\nregiments, condemned to week of ditch-digging, that the gunboats might\narrive at the bend of the Mississippi below by a canal, out of reach of\nthe batteries.Day in and day out they labored, officer and men.Sawing\noff stumps under the water, knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the\nbranches, while the river rose and rose and rose, and the rain crept\nby inches under their tent flies, and the enemy walked the parapet of\nVicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the\nbatteries, that their smiles might be sobered.To the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of\nsaws, whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes, the news\nof an expedition into the Vicksburg side of the river was hailed with\ncaps in the air.To be sure, the saw and axe, and likewise the levee and\nthe snakes, were to be there, too.But there was likely to be a little\nfighting.The rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the\ndetachment put off in the little \'Diligence\' and \'Silver Wave\'.All the night the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and\ncottonwood, and snapping the trailing vines.Some other regiments\nwent by another route.The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General\nSherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with\ntheir noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the\nRebels.The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon\nwaist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come.Presently\nthe General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black\nBayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou.The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a\nsecond detachment.All through the Friday the navy great guns were\nheard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until\nthe quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle.Saws\nstopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day\nthe General lifted his head anxiously.As he sat down in the evening in\na slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon, the sound still hovered\namong the trees and rolled along the still waters.It was three o\'clock Saturday morning when\nthe sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence.A <DW64>, white eyed,\nbedraggled, and muddy, stood in the candle light under the charge of a\nyoung lieutenant.The officer saluted, and handed the General a roll of\ntobacco."I found this man in the swamp, sir.He has a message from the\nAdmiral--"\n\nThe General tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper\nwhich he spread out and held under the candle.He turned to a staff\nofficer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat."Kilby Smith\nand all men here across creek to relief at once.I\'ll take canoe through\nbayou to Hill\'s and hurry reenforcements."The staff officer paused, his hand on the latch of the door.You\'re not going through that sewer in a\ncanoe without an escort!""I guess they won\'t look for a needle in that haystack," the General\nanswered."Get back to your\nregiment, Brice, if you want to go," he said.All through the painful march that\nfollowed, though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees, he\nthought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black\nlabyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue\nof the gunboats.The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman\nhimself.How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them\non a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the\nlittle transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent\'s\nreply when the General asked if he would follow him."As long as the\nboat holds together, General."The boughs hammered\nat the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell\nlike a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a\nhalf.Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his\nhand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep\nbackwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their\nheads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found\na picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the\nday before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing\nfurther the stream below the fleet."The Admiral\'s in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet\nthe General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can\'t move\nbackward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from\nthe cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on\nthe right.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads\nwith their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How\nPorter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a\nmemorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny\nhorse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of\nthat familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the\ndrops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on\nthe deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he\nrode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose\ndaring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly\nthe only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,\ndid the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass\nin his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the\nswamp?"He\'s a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain\nwounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name\nis Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at\nYoung\'s Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat\nfrom St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and\nastonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer\nthe way to General Sherman\'s headquarters.The officer, who was greatly\nimpressed by the gentleman\'s looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge\nwhich spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house\nup to its first floor in the backwaters.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn\'t Brinsmade.Come right in, come\nright in and take dinner.I\'ll send\nand tell Grant you\'re here.Brinsmade, if it wasn\'t for you and your\nfriends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we\'d all have been dead of\nfever and bad food long ago.""I guess a\ngood many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I\'ve come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses\nare doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly\nthe affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the\ntwo gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The\nGeneral surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in\nthe cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their\nfaces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond\nthem."That\'s poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They\ntell me he can\'t live," and "That\'s Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish\nsome of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep\nwell--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no\npeace at all at Memphis was from your city.Why, I had to keep a whole\ncorps on duty to watch him."As long as\nI live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed\ninoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our\nchurches.""I guess that\'s so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on\nhim again, he\'s clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have\nyou ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may\nremember talking to him one evening at my house."He\npaused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,\nwhen Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,\nfor three days I\'ve had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone\nand gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked\nStephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He\nhas spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go\nto war.The first thing I hear of\nhim is that he\'s digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his\ncap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter\nto sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice\'s company\non the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I\nshouldn\'t have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he\nswept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge\nleading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him\nto report here at once.Brice\'s company were swinging axes when the\norderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his\nboot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he\ngave the General\'s message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his\nclothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room\nwhere the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,\nsmoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the\ntable.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced\non the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,\nas always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was\ntilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small\nwonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in\nSherman.The sound that had caught Stephen\'s attention was the General\'s voice,\nsomewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man\nsays, \'Well, I can resist, but I\'ll have my fun just this once.\'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly\nover him as he added:\n\n"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head\nto heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,\nand Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen\'s hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that\nformal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be\nrejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her\nwell, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which\nyour mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he\ndeplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,\nbut he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his\nlittle room.We have got old Nancy, Hester\'s mother,\nto stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss\nJinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at\nthe mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored\nfor it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her\nfather\'s before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The\nthought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely\nsweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I\nshould like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite\nme.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,\nand--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very\ncurious expression, spoke up."That\'s hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to\nStephen\'s tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the\npackage from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,\nthe canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who\nshould come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a\ncracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I\nthink you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted\nit."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I\'ve been\nthinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come \'round\nand talk it over with you first.That isn\'t strictly according to\nthe rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn\'t stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I\nremember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways\nWhat was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn\'t they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him\na lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting\nme on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort\nHenry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned\nforward."And do you remember I said to you, \'Brice, when you get ready to come\ninto this war, let me know.\'Then he said gravely, but with just a\nsuspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you\nwouldn\'t be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen\'s\nshoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn\'t."A STRANGE MEETING\n\nThe story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure\nturned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the\nhistory of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither\nfor mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise\nwith equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work\ngone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And\nby grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and\nsuffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports\nswept around the bend and passed the city\'s heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the\nsound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a\nbase--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the\ncountry clear of forage.Confederate generals in\nMississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen\nBrice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on\na log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one\ntalking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile\nof the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that\nseemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain\nGrant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not\nchanged a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,\nartillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their\nplaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where\nthe face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by\nthe rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias\nand the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,\nsave for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood\ntottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out\nbelow.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous\nrepulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs\ninto the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army\nsettled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that\nnarrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold\nagonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring\nback what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi\'s banks\nbeyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big\nshells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could\nbe seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of\nsmoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and\ndeepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of\nblue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along\nthe rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her\nvantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants\ndisappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down\nthe trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the\nground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the\nnarrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Above ground the saps\nwere so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and\nthe other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,\nsometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white\nside of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were\nindulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses\nrolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who\nreplied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens\nof Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the\nVicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour\nof three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files\nwound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the\nenemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the\nJackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle\ncrack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not\nthe stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was\nthe stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were\ndimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot\nblast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of\nshattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as\narms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty\nthousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the\ncrater\'s edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran\nacross that rim of a summer\'s after-noon died in torture under tier upon\ntier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on\na scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at\nVicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the\nNation\'s birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune\'s had delivered one comrade of old\ninto the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she\nhad heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think\nor care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting\nof old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner\nbiting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and\ngone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war\ndoes not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg\nsurrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See\nthe gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds\nof that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the\nblue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms\nare stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when\nthe counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for\nmonths have sought each other\'s lives are grouped in friendly talk.The\ncoarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke\nquivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a\nwistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man\nas he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday\nof their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General\nLauman\'s brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter\nfrom the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from\nafar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its\nface blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old\nfour-posted bed, and beside it a child\'s cot is standing pitifully,--the\ntiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the\nfoot.So much for one of the navy\'s shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was\nacted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and\nwith her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her\nhis arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him\ngood by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money\nfrom his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that\nhe might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that\nhe actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your\nway.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long\nmustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,\n"you\'ve brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we\'d\nbeen fo\'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of\nhimself.He had marked the man\'s charitable action, and admired his\nattempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack\nof food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He\nwore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so\nthat Stephen\'s six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen\'s rank, "so we won\'t qua\'l as to\nwho\'s host heah.One thing\'s suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I\'ve been\nheah longest.Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children\ndown in the Palmetto State.I can\'t offer you a dinner, seh.We\'ve\neaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to\ninterpolate that Stephen wouldn\'t be there otherwise.)"But I can offer\nyou something choicer than you have in the No\'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel\nremarked that Stephen\'s eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope\'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington\'s Army.My name is\nJennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have\nthe advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and\nthereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like\nstraight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit\nseemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor\njustice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with\nstill greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple\'s cigars, to which\nhis new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping\nchasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees\nfelled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed\nacross from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your\ndamned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,\nand yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he\n"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>\ncame down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company\nwas stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a\nmatter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our\nsap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious\ncuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore\nmusket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive\nbullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our\nofficers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One\nfellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He\'s the pride of\nour Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope\nman.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to\nyour side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses\nin De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the\nface of our own batteries and your guns.That man was wounded by a trick\nof fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his\ndinner in Vicksburg.He\'s pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the\nColonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain\'t a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you\nmight be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I\'d\nhate to see him die.The doctor says he\'ll pull through if he can get\ncare and good air and good food."He seized Stephen\'s arm in a fierce\ngrip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don\'t look\nlike the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his\nformer languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,\nwhere the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the\nmagazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby\nJennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman\'s voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched\non the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was\na little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,\nbeside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which\nseemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture\nof restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the\nangles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has\nslept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more\nhandsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit\nburned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he\ndragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen\'s rigid arm, "does he look as\nbad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,\nand bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was\npitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging\nat his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"\n\n"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence\'s answer Stephen well knew what was\npassing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor\nfrom a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special\ndetestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the\nmemory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia\nhad not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now\nthat the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was\nunfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the\ninstrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the\nsick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that\nseemed to rouse him.And then, with\nsome vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven\'t whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,\n"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you\'re too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North\nto-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of\nthe room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He\'s sick--and God Almighty,\nhe\'s proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went\nstraight to Stephen\'s heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned\nproud--But we ain\'t cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet\nagain--as friends.""Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we\nmay as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of\na group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to\nrecognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this\nglorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of\nthem."Seeing that the General\'s genial, interested expression did not\nchange, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a\nlog and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"\n\n"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after\nthat.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran\nthese batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their\ngunners.""I\'d like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he\nwas hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He\'s\nrather far gone now, General, and they say he can\'t live unless he can\nbe sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as\nlong as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to\nsend him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I\'ll bet he didn\'t\nthank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods\nare the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They\nnever did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like\nthe devil, fight like the devil, but don\'t care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how\nthey hate a Yankee!He\'s a cousin of that\nfine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a\npity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my\nadvice, sir, and don\'t try to tame any wildcats.""I\'m glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when\nStephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to\ndo that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how\nhe flared up when I mentioned the girl?"This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital\nsteamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE\n\nSupper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past\nat Colonel Carvel\'s house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,\nproud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How\nVirginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom\nher aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none\nwas present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax\'s prattle about the\nfashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I\'m sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river\nstirred the lawn of Virginia\'s gown.The girl, with her hand on the\nwicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,\nacross the Illinois prairie."I don\'t see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news\ntravels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,\ntelling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of\nsilence was the best for her aunt\'s unreasonableness.Certainly, if\nClarence\'s letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,\nnews of her father\'s Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn\'t that her name?--doesn\'t take him to\nher house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has\nlived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee\nyourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old\nman.""The Judge is an old friend of my father\'s; I think he would wish it,"\nreplied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She\nthought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying\npatient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence\nof the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had\ntaken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the\nday she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge\'s bedside.The\nmarvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in\nspite of all barriers.Often when the Judge\'s pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he\nwould speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light\nwould come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia\nto see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into\nslumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge\nfrom this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit\nto herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen\'s letters to\nthe Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty\nof praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday\nVirginia had read one of these to Mr.Well\nthat his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen\'s mother was\nnot there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it\nnot been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on\nhim, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit\nat Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant\'s capture of\nVicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we\'ll make short work of the\nRebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as\nshe repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange\nthat, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia\non the stairway.Well she knew the girl\'s nature, and how difficult she\nmust have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But\nVirginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her\nheart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was\nthankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old\nNancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have\nmore room and air.And Colonel Carvel\'s name had\nnever once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they\ntoiled against the river\'s current, while horror held her.Horror lest\nher father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by\nthe battle\'s surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was\nnot yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of\nwounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at\nVicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been\nColonel Carvel\'s!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that\nwas dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,\nhe was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia\nsat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning\nquivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the\ngravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell\non a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among\nthe captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"\n\n"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind\nenough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,\nin African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and\nNed.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall\nchamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence\nhanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to\nVirginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia\nwas driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then\nher aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send\nfor Dr.By spells she wept,\nwhen they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She\nwould creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter\'s watches and\ntalk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the\nalarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned\nwas riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to\nMrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day\nor night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while\nwalking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing\non her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down\nat her!\'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous\nand exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found\nthe seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia\'s feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God\nhad mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,\nwhen she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized\nfirst of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With\nthe petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless\nVirginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his\nhot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during\nthat fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted\nbefore her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that\npresence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the\neffects which people saw.And this is why\nwe cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who\nchanges,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,\nthrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who\ncould not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch\nin the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels\nstirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,\nwhile the two women sat by.Colfax\'s headaches came\non, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes\nof their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,\nof their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of\nthe battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and\nhe clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of\nJackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and\nnow that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she\nlooked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon\nher, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his\ncustom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,\nhis stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk\'s indulgence was\ngossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always\nmanaged to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude\nCatherwood\'s love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate\narmy had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he\nwould mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once\n(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined\nthat he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he\narose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his\nnurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every\nday?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for\nhim, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to\nhave him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color\ngo.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the\narmy.He was transferred to Lauman\'s brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no\nbusiness in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into\nall the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon\npoisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made\nthe charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"\nadded the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician\nto the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor\'s arm sought\nVirginia\'s back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at\nClarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands\nconvulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for\na moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was\nstanding motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said\nquickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor\'s mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the\nroad to town that day.And the Doctor\'s black servant heard his master\nutter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the\nheaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence\ngaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast\nrising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell\nbefore the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by\nillness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time\nwhen I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I\ndid when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my\nnature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the\nrotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when\nI fell on the roof of Alfred\'s cabin?It was\nbecause you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said\ntenderly.It isn\'t to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not\nbrought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day\njust before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple\nhaze was over there across the river.You were\ngrown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember\nthe doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried\nto kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,\nI had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never\nstudied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn\nsomething,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned\nhouses.Floated down the river on a log\nafter a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not\nhave that, I would send <DW71> to my father\'s room for his ebony box and\nblow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to\nshirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But\nthat is all gone now, Jinny.Now\nI see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle\nComyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple\'s\noffice, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom\nyou had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who\nbid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her\nhead."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path\nmany times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you\nhad in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of\nmyself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you\nhad in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that\nnight at the Brinsmades\', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had\nlost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone\nagain."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you\ndown the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"\n\n"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that\nman," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"\n\n"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He\ncame into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told\nhim that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,\ninsulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,\nVirginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"\n\n"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave\nthing to do, and a generous.He\nthought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of\nmarrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never\nknown the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved\nme all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that\nwas hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had\ndisappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she\nfound her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE\'S OFFICE\n\nAfter this Virginia went to the Judge\'s bedside every day, in the\nmorning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him\nwhen he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which\nI think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have\nher beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than\nshe could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung\nthe paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish\nold bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are\nnot here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown\nto me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day\nwill come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the\ninheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my\ndear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and\ndevotion to our Republic."The Judge\'s voice trembled with earnestness\nas he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with\nthe sacred fire of his life\'s purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she\ncould not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better\nthan any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would\nrest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud\nupon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after\nStephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was\na pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days\nVirginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and\nfrequently Mr.For it is those who have\nthe most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour\nfor their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and\nscarce did Anne\'s figure appear in the doorway before the question had\narisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia\'s choice of\nher cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,\nhad drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia\nherself had never once asked her about Stephen\'s condition and she spoke\nof this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny\'s heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best\nfriend were a Yankee--"\n\nJudge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of\nthe room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I\nguess you don\'t understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last\nof his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of\nletting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though\ndevoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence\ngave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;\nor at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of\nthe summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the\nroses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this\nmerely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through\nwhich she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and\ncomforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the\nbrightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen\ngown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the\ngraceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers\neverywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,\nthere was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all\nlaughter.He said it over to himself\nmany, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes\nupon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded\nher face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,\nas the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she\ndid not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who\nwere gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling\nfor her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the\nwar, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very\nlike it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not\ngive them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,\nimploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love\nhim, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives\ntogether, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence\nColfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power\nof self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to\nheights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the\nmistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly\nmiserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had\nshe taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain\ntimes when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison\nColfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission\nto send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow\ncame,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence\'s\nreport that he was fit for duty once more.He\nwas to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport\nIndianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from\nSandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the\nConfederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men\nwho made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and\nthe resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and\nyet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness\nof the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the\ncorn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still\nin its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and\nAlfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his\nwhite head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his\nsouthward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to\ntake with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were\nstanding in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around\nthe corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear\nhim.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so\ndear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is\nthere, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won\'t come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob\nde light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo\' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I\'be seed \'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the\nfour feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the\nlawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found\nhis cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier\nwho brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up\nto see me."He went to Judge Whipple\'s rooms, ma\'am.I\nreckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned\nand <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage\nwas flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade\'s place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under\nthe spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his\ncousin\'s face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed\nintently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the\nbushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner\nof the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage\nstopped.Looking out, she saw the provost\'s guard like black card\nfigures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court\nHouse loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway\nwhich led to the Judge\'s rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,\nflew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel\'s\narms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the\nYankees catch you--"\n\n"They won\'t catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her\nout at arm\'s length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she\nsearched his own."I\'m not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was\nnearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a\nman, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and\nheard Silas was dying, I just couldn\'t resist.He\'s the oldest friend\nI\'ve got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"\n\n"Pa, you\'ve been in battle?""And you weren\'t hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a\nwhile: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can\'t last\nthrough the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up\neverything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son\ncame home.She is a noble woman--"\n\n"Her son?"Silas has done nothing\nthe last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before\nhe dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked\ndown at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around\nthe room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,\n"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see\nif he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she\nmight have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing\nbeside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out\'n Willums\'s, Miss Jinny.He was\na-gwine shufflin\' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,\npos\' has\'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the\nstairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps\nClarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open\nthe door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I\nreckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am\nafraid they are watching the place.""I don\'t think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after\ndark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her\nfather\'s sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have\ndragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long\nhe stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an\neternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel\nstood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these\nmany years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give\nyou my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no\nother reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was\ndying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"\n\nMr.How many men do you think would risk their\nlives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now\ndie happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I\nthank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me\nto add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I\nhope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were\ndying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not\nleave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in\nthis world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so\nmuch of Judge Whipple\'s life had been spent.And\nhow completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield\ncovered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father\'s arm as they\nleaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of\nthe night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper\'s face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those\nwho have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the\nflesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for\na low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge\'s heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia\'s eyes.Of the old days,\nof the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her\nfather, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how\nsometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose\nand say:\n\n"It\'s my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn\nthat he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple\'s nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon\nthis silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard\nthat Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She\nwondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only\none who had ever been known to break the Judge\'s will.Virginia\'s\neyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,\nsmoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen\'s features were in hers,\nbut not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and\nsoftened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia\'s look upon her, glanced up\nfrom the Judge\'s face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,\nand again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between\nmother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought\nof Clarence crossed Virginia\'s mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence\nfrom Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from\nthe Judge\'s room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk\nin front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line\nof books which stood on end.--Chitty\'s Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf\non Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached\nout and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a\nhigh and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other\nside of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was\nhis desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man\nwho lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last\nhours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,\nbut stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his\nmother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen\nBrice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her\nbelief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts\ncrowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and\ncrossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the\nFair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade\'s gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream\nof him.And now he had saved Clarence\'s life that she might marry her\ncousin.Again she glanced at the\nsignature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She\nturned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant\'s counsel\nessays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,\nnote.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered\nwith them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article\nfor M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had\nalways coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her\nchin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his\nvoice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her\neyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But\nwhen she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she\ntrembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting\nquivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She\nherself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person\nexhaled.He needed not to have\nspoken for her to have felt that.She\nknew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of\nthe chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the\nJudge\'s room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was\nthinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that\nwere not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid\nopen at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone\nsomewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad\nto indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we\nall--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor\nenough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated\nyou well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand\nin pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can\nnever repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help\nyou, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our\narmy would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest\nstranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for\nvery shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength\nto suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul\nresponded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of\nwoman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,\nand it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under\nhim."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the\ntitle, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won\'t you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours\nwhen I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for\nClarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"\n\n"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her\nlips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were\never more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the\ntumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like\nwise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It\nwas a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of\nit, And he is an old friend of my father--"\n\n"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled\nwith Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I\nshould make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge\nWhipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how\nhe would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this\nearth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her\npent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived\nfrom Stephen\'s letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"\nshe said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams\nof her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He\ncould not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and\nmodulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be\nthe last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme\neloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic\nforce which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into\nthe room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,\nand his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed\nhis motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his\nshoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence\'s slighter figure,\nerect, compact, springy.The Southerner\'s eye, for that moment, was\nflint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen\'s face, thinned by\nillness, was grave.For an instant\nthey stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was\nStephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his\nvoice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice\nfor my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the\nundue accent on her cousin\'s last words, and she glanced apprehensively\nat Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am\nhappy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same\ntime to have served her so well.It is\nto her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too\nfar, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and\nhad come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she\ngazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she\ntook her cousin\'s arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she\nsaid."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You\nhave put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life\'s obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,\nincredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and\nwhen she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,\nimpetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a\nscoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of\none who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that\nsmile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a\ncross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward\nthe door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after\nhim:\n\n"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing\nmotionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge\'s room," she said."I thought--"\n\n"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took\na step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word\nthat he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard\nthat the Judge was dying--"\n\n"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to\nquestion."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then\nshe softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring\nafter them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT\n\nWhen the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they\nfell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he\ntried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it\nfaintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel\'s face twitched, and the silence in that little room\nseemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight\nagainst your country.Can it be that you have at last\nreturned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers\ndied?"Poor Colonel Carvel\n\n"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But\nthey knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were\nfriends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"\n\n"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few\nmore than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I\nwould that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a\ndistant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that\nGod had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the\nhighest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on\nthe pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared\nlook at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a\nclergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near\nenough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand\nin the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that\nhe might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my\nway down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, \'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, \'No,\nsir, I am not Senator Whipple\'s son.If the\nbishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have\nmade my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not\nall like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when\nI was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,\nmore gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life\nbefore."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had\ncome to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in\nmaking the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a\nbetter opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me\nwhen I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such\na mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He\nsent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do\nthat.He has\ngiven you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need\nnever be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his\neyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at\nthe change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the\nfire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared\nthrough his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall\nyou be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,\nand the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be\ntrue to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what\nI have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our\nfathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of\ngain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in\nthis Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and\nthe waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the\nincorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and\nthose like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,\nsternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve\nyour country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and\nreached out his bony hand to seek Stephen\'s."I was harsh with you at\nfirst, my son," he went on.And when I had tried\nyou I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this\nnation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born\nagain--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I\nsaw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would\nthat his hands--Abraham Lincoln\'s hands--might be laid upon all who\ncomplain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in\nlife: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his\ndays had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,\nwhen they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham\nLincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his\nown heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes\nwere closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain\'t gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you\nprovided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then\nthe Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had\nbeen listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were\ntrue to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have\nrisked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the\nbutton at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,\nbut still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did\nhis eyes seek Stephen\'s?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you\nplay my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was\nStephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by\nVirginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl\'s\nexaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,\nand those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power\nof earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom\n        Lead Thou me on\n        The night is dark, and I am far from home;\n        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see\n        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple\'s wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room\nwhere Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent\nupon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear\nfor her father\'s safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,\nremained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,\nand opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by\nwas striking twelve.Only Stephen\nsaw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out\nlifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the\ndoor.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning\ndimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze\nwas held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the\nroom.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined\nin the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry\nescaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion\nat once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she\ngave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I\'ve got something I want to say to you, Miss\nVirginia."But she\nshivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to\ndo.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,\nand get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she\ncould not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know\nthat she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even\nswiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the\njet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;\nconfronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of\nhimself, he were awed."I ain\'t here to see the Judge."She felt her\nlips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of\nthose of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,\nin horror."And if you don\'t give me what I want, I cal\'late to see some\none else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme\neffort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his\neyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel\nCarvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his\nforehead, hot at the very thought.Then,\nremembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying\nout."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if\nI choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There\'s but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there\'s but one price\nto pay, and that\'s you--you.I cal\'late you\'ll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses\nwere strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a\nfootstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her\nheart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came\nbetween them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books\non the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she\nthought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered\nsteel, glittered in Stephen\'s eyes, and his hands following up the\nmastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen\nshook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if\nhe expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from\nMr.Hopper\'s cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not\nfathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what\nhe saw there made him tremble."He--he won\'t touch me again while you\nare here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books\nfell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed\nupon some one behind them.Before the Judge\'s door stood Colonel Carvel,\nin calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as\nhe pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer\nhim, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly\nthe memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man\'s\nhands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen\nBrice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he\nhad seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she\nknew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in\nhis coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard\non the stairway.There followed four seconds\nof suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a\nworried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about\nhim, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper\nstanding in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you\'re the spy, are you?"Then he turned his\nback and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams\'s entry as we drove\nup.He strode to the open window at the back\nof the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the\nstreet.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck\nhim."No, I ain\'t the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal\'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward\nColonel Carvel.What\'s to prevent my\ncalling up the provost\'s guard below?"he continued, with a smile that\nwas hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell\nwhether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel\'s\nmouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia\'s form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see\nher.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that\nshould have been an ominous warning.It\nwas clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited\nin the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a\ndesire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His\nvoice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let\'s be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won\'t say\nanything about the past.But I ain\'t set on having you shot.There\'s a\nconsideration that would stop me, and I cal\'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia\nhad crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,\nfaintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not\nleave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were\nclasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while\nshe clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen\nBrice\'s voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,\ndeliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or\nheard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for\nyou to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk\nsedition in private, how you have made money out of other men\'s misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings\nwith the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call\nhimself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings\nin Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be\nhung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE\n\nOf the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the\nMarch from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH\n24, 1865\n\nDEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause\nas I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched\nthe four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General\nhimself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever\nmade by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will\nnot be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of\nthis campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and\nall but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and\nartillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and\nevery mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I\ndid not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at\nthat season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most\nsolemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and\nequipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left\nKingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man\nI met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp\nJackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the\ncommanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than\nhe.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into\nColumbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master\nstroke of strategy.You should see him as\nhe rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular\nand awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the\nnew regiments can\'t resist cheering.He generally says to the\nColonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn\nnorthward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night\nI was walking my horse close to the General\'s over the pine needles,\nwhen we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"\nsaid one, "I guess Uncle Billy don\'t know our corps is goin\' north.""I wonder if he does,\'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them\nwhite socks, I\'d know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story\nto Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers\nand men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to\ntake advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near\nto him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have\na conversation something on this order:-- "There\'s Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,\nlooked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we\nmake a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock\nto headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his\nperception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this\nstaff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall\nvalue all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:\n\n   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis\n   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the\n   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I\n   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had\n   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can\'t get\n   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to\n   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,\n\n                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I\nfound him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked\nme a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,\nespecially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to\nbeat off Joe Johnston\'s army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by\nthe way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me\nagainst Johnston."\'He\'s wily, Sherman,\' said he."\'Grant,\' said I, \'you give me men enough and time enough to look over\nthe ground, and I\'m not afraid of the devil.\'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of\nfate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will\nprove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has\nthe greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare\nbursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with\ngay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,\nand white Hudson\'s Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between\nforked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the\nbusy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,\nsometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a\nlonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed\nif a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I\nwake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think\nof the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the\nmud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,\nand our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the\nlittle dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl\nto sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist\ndeep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a\nweary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have\nalso been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and\naccoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,\ncheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much\neither, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,\ntear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,\nto go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and\nmire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And\nhow the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line\nbegan after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not\nshared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction\nwith Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am\nwriting at General Schofield\'s headquarters.There was a bit of a battle\non Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning\nhomes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin\nat the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons\nof the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of\nBentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece\nof wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of\nJohnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we\ndid not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming\nto the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed\nwith the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little\nor nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle\ninto the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and\njust as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion\nsome distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just\nthat instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,\nwho was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow\nwas not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of\ndismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the\nrear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of\nthe skirmishers came up."We\'ve got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he\'d get\ninto our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as\ngood a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who\nsent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word\ncame back that the man\'s name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union\nsympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been\nconscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to\nbe pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message\nthat he thought the story fishy.This was because the man\'s appearance\nwas very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who\nwould do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,\nevidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find\nnothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could\nsee him in person.It was about nine o\'clock last night when I reached\nthe house the General has taken.A prisoner\'s guard was resting outside,\nand the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was\nawaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the\ndining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,\nholding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He\ndid not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and\nstraight, just out of range of the candles\' rays.He wore the easy dress\nof a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back\nso that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the\neyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I\nhad when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman\'s charge.I was aware of\nsomething very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But\nthis is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember\nstaying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord\nNorthwell\'s daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar\nover the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in\nthe eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I\nsaw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the\npicture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"\n\n"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over\ngreen seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I\nshould almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this\nman again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he\nlooked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,\nvery boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was\nsufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But\nnow--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in\nGoldsboro!I did not know how he\nwould act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do\nyou do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking\nhim And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled\nat me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,\nwas moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more\nabruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General\nturned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on\nthe tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they\nwould have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if\nyou had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform\nYou know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp\naway in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany\ntable between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on\nus from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open\nwindows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:\n\n"I hope he won\'t be shot, General.""Don\'t know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,\nbut war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to\nfight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I\'m going to\nsend you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I\'m sorry Dunn\nwent back yesterday, but it can\'t be helped."You\'ll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won\'t be through until\nto-morrow: I\'ll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a\nday or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his\nkeen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn\'t\nyou?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the\nCourt House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I\'ll see, I\'ll see.Thank God this war is pretty\nnear over.I\'ll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly\nengineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest\napprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;\nfor as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,\nlike the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up\nties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the\ntunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said\nthere was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken\nour speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until\nwe were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the\nstillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of\nthe Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the\ndesolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill\nmorning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED\n\n             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\n              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope\nthat you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up\nlike a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I\nfirst caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front\nof it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and\nsmoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats\nand supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled\ntogether, and our captain pointed out to me the \'Malvern\' flying Admiral\nPorter\'s flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were\npiled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it\nwas Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the\nragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city\nof tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green\ntowering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag\ndrooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was\nGeneral Grant\'s headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped\nashore before they told me she was President Lincoln\'s.I read the name\non her--the \'River Queen\'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his\nwife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am\nliving with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain\nnow, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant\'s\nheadquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might\nbuild for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars\nand Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of\nofficers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General\nhad walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic\nas "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,\nand we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,\nand a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman\'s staff.He has brought\ndespatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out\nfor the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light\nanother cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should\nsay marvels, now.It did not seem so\nstrange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who\nhad risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of\nour armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that\nday in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a\nmilitary carpet-bagger out of a job.But\nhow different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same\nman out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I\nlittle dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the\nWest and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he\nhas done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with\nevery means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the\nonly one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him\nfettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two\nmen who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them\nquickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he\nsaid.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that\nhe only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that\nthey were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of\nour march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival\nof different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who\nfloundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he\nhad in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I\nwould be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which\neven has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the\nroads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign\nagainst Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his\nmaterial.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals\nof our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and\nso we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for\na horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the\ncorduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that\ntall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the\nflats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories\nwith the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don\'t change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These\nare the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as\nknowledge.I believe that he will change the\nworld, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock\'s fire, an officer\ncame in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you\nwould care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to\nkeep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River\nQueen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,\nin the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but\nyesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son\nTad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,\ntowering figure in black.But the sad\nsmile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just\nthe same.It was sad and lined\nwhen I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,\nNorth and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,\nwhich reminded me of Judge Whipple\'s.Yes, it was just as if I had been\nwith him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn\'t\nthink that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep \'em.""They\'re unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge\nme."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I\'ve kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard\nSherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you\nto-day, Mr."I\'m glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven\'t joined the\nranks of the grumblers?You haven\'t been one of those who would have\nliked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how\nto do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn\'t think you were that kind,\nSteve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears\nseven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty\ndays?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count\non those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the\nPedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the\narmy wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the\nMississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro\' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk\nup and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks\nmight amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all\nright.That\'s the best recommendation you can give the General--just\nsay \'Uncle Billy.\'""You\'ve given \'Uncle\nBilly\' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the\nstory of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had\nbeen living with."\'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther\nDalton, though he moightn\'t be knowing just the respict the likes of a\nfirst-class garthener is entitled to.\'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But\nI could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the\nGeneral.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell\nme something about \'Uncle Billy\'s <DW15>s.\'I hear that they have a most\neffectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe\'s contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the\nheaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were\npiled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President\nlistened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his\nbridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how\nthe <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the\nGeneral had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,\nand explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn\ntheir own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them\nplainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went\non earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can\'t be overestimated.Any\nthought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a\n<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that\neverybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a\nboy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because\nI could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night\nthinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the\nword demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a\nvolume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in\nit, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport\ndebates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas\'s.And I\nunderstood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that\nhad conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at\nthe close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.\'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,\nbut few chosen.\'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could\ntalk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would\ndisarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life\nis so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that\nthey would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I\nhope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don\'t want to\nsee any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking\nto himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax\'s case.He has been on my\nmind ever since.Once he sighed, and\nhe was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a\ntechnicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish\nline at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side\nof him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save\nColfax, but it won\'t save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving\nout, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of\nhis.)If it wasn\'t for them, the\nSouth would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,\nand said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn\'t exactly a friend of\nyours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this\nway.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account\nof his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about\nMiss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day\nin the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She\'s a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to\nprolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation\'s sake.They are to be the\nmothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,\nSteve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her\nrather often.he cried, jumping up, "she\'s a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I\nalways had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of\nthe old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as\nbrave as a lion.You\'ve heard the story of how he threw a man named\nBabcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It\ndid me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what\'s become of the\nColonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn\'t\nbeen heard of since the summer of \'63.And so\nyou want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I\nhoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be\nglad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that\'s my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It\'s\nalways one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep\nbetter.I\'ve pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he\ncontinued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in\ncomes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut\nup in McDowell\'s and Alton.I said:-- "\'Senator, you\'re not going to ask\nme to turn loose all those at once?\'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while\nago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly\nover.And then what does he do but pull out another batch\nlonger than the first!you don\'t want me to turn these loose, too?\'I think it will pay to be merciful.\'"\'Then durned if I don\'t,\' I said, and I signed \'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send\nreached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a\nshort letter.I am on the President\'s boat,\nin the President\'s party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how\nit happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman\nhimself arrived at City Point on the steamer \'Russia\'.I heard the\nsalutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and\nGeneral Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see\nthe President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant\nsilent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;\nand Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You\ncan imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was\nstanding at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my\nshoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he\'s got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"\nsaid Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,\nSherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked\nyou and called you \'Uncle Billy.\'And I told him that was the best\nrecommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that\ngo through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You\'ll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don\'t want the Major right away, do\nyou?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just\na little bit."I\'ve got a sneaking notion that Grant\'s going to do\nsomething."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be\ncareful he doesn\'t talk you to death--he\'s said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have\nridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy\nand errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is\nthe last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of\nFive Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front\nof the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was\nraging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,\nand--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter\nthe smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the\nPresident.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I\nshould choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer\nlay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had\nbuilt.There were but a few of us in his\nparty, and we stepped into Admiral Porter\'s twelve-oared barge and were\nrowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We\nlanded within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half\nto General Weitzel\'s headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the\nConfederacy.I shall remember him always as\nI saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk\nhat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he\nwalked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows\nfilled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the\nPresident was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried\nhosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his\ncoat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President\'s\nfeet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a\nconqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the\ncrowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the\nPotomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--\n\n          "Duncan is in his grave;\n        After life\'s fitful fever he sleeps well;\n        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,\n        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,\n        Can touch him further."WILLARD\'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW\n\nThe train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight\nof the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely\npressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station\nof the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look\nafter them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the\ngirl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle\'s house, my dear?"she asked,\nglancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she\nhad worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle\'s house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,\nalert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you\ncould, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,\nyou promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma\'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain\'t de kerridge\nyou wants.Dat\'s it, lady, you\'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,\nkerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she\nstood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing\npatiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming\nand going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and\nterritories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching\nhearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the\nthrong hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful\nhomes they had left?Destroyed,\nlike her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and\nmothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young\nmen and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear\nones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands\nand tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood\nbeyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then\nsat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They\nwere splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,\nCaptain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to\ndesist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don\'t\ncompare to St.Louis, except we haven\'t got the White House and the\nCapitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we\ndon\'t have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine\nHouses like that.We don\'t\nhave any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence\nstreets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren\'t pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You\'ve had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I\'d put up with a good deal more than\nthis for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun\'ll only come out and dry things up and\nlet us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to\nsee the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you\'re just trying to keep up my spirits.You\'ve been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There\'s nothing for you to\nbe cast down about.""Suppose I can\'t make your Black\nRepublican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear\nunconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the\nnear side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread\nthe umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,\nflanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a\nseries of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They\nclimbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by\na smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain\'t to home now."Didn\'t he get my telegram day before\nyesterday?"He\'s done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by\nthe young lady\'s looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo\' you,\nmiss?""I\'m his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler\'s face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you\noften--yas\'m.De General\'ll be to home dis a\'ternoon, suah.\'Twill do\nhim good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right\nin, Cap\'n, and make yo\'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at\nCalve\'t House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall\nsofa."Yas\'m," said Lizbeth, "jes\' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a\nwalnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs\nplaced about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and\nstarted out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I\'m going to the White House in a little\nwhile.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming\ncalmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don\'t go doin\' any such fool\ntrick as that.Your Uncle Dan\'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing\'ll be fixed all right, and no\nmistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used\nfor three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she\nspoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can\'t get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn\'t any one a right to see the President?You\nmean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these\npretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the\nYankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,\nremind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee\'s surrender and the\napproaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of\nthe President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and\nreviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,\nbe he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a\ndistance may come at a President\'s true character and worth.The Captain\nhad seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the\npleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know\nwhat to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the\nSouth; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and\nhe had seen enough in the girl\'s demeanor to fear that she was going to\ndemand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to\nbend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,\nJinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then\nshe took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won\'t do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won\'t get you\nhalfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations\nof Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and\nsplashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,\nand catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of\nLee\'s surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not\nrepress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you\'ll find the President a good\ndeal of a man.Now if you\'re allowed to see him, don\'t get him mad,\nJinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a\nwoman."And just then they came in sight of the house of\nthe Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they\nturned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a\nblack coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately\ngentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some\nmoney to the driver."I reckon he needn\'t wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook\nher head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the\nanteroom of the President\'s office on the second floor.There were\nmany people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who\nstared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all\nsorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and\nkeen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier\nsitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their\nseats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the\ndoorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you\'ll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and\nlooking at Virginia."It\'s slow work waiting your turn,\nthere\'s so many governors and generals and senators, although the\nsession\'s over.And added, with an inspiration,\n"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman\'s instinct, that these words had had\ntheir effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You\'re sure, miss, it\'s life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to\ngive precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a\nminute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I\'ll see what I\ncan do for you.In a little while the heavy door\nopened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of\nwhat he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped\ninto the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was\na big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the\nPresident of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave\nher.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,\nthe unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more\nridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the\npoor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long\nblack coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a\nlittle."I guess I\'ll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from\nSt."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have\nrarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed\nyou.""Oh, you haven\'t," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you\nwould call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I\nam searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come\nto say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell\nabout General Buck Tanner.One day the\nboys asked him over to the square to make a speech."\'I\'m all right when I get standing up, Liza,\' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How\'m I going to stop \'em when I want to?\'"\'Well, I du declare, Buck,\' said she, \'I gave you credit for some\nsense.All you\'ve got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour\nand a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."\'Boys,\' said he, \'it\'s jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You\'ll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I\'m never going to get\nshet of this goldarned speech any anther way.\'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to\nlaugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such\na time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his\noffice.And yet this was the President\nwho had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,\nColonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss\nCarvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn\'t he come\nwith you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in\nexasperation."In General Joseph Johnston\'s army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General\nSherman\'s army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn\'t," she cried."You don\'t know how brave he is!He\nfloated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought\nback thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the\nriver when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so\nthat they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that\'s a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man\nI used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he\nwas a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before\nJudge Drake."\'Judge, says McNeil, \'you oughtn\'t to lock this man up.It was a fair\nfight, and he\'s the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what\'s\nmore, he\'s never been licked in a fair fight in his life.\'"\'And if your honor does lock me up,\' the prisoner put in, \'I\'ll give\nyour honor a thunderin\' big lickin\' when I get out.\'"\'Gentlemen,\' said he, \'it\'s a powerful queer argument, but the Court\nwill admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the\ngrass.\'"She was striving against\nsomething, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was\ndangerously near to tears.She had come into\nthis man\'s presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it\nwithout an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical\nanswers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be\nsure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had\nnever conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia\ndeemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe\nthat Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp\nJackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"\nshe answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don\'t hold that against\nhim."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was\nmerely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,\nit is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned\nand attempted to enter General Sherman\'s lines as a civilian,--as a\nspy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to\nheed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the\ncrest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything\nelse in war.You are not content in, the North\nwith what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of\nour rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we\ndespise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting\ninnocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And\nall this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"\n\nWhy did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard\njust now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the\nineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the\nsorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how\nheavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a\nworld that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and\nwas silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and\nsorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest\nof all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the\nsame strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that\ncame to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds\nwhere the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument\nto the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria\nin the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew\nthat she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she\ncould not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not\nfathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears\nat his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in\nthat moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her\nsoul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think\nthat was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in\nWashington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he\nis in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that\nthis officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few\nwords to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,\nerect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the\nPresident.He saw her lips part and the\ncolor come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his\nprofile.Lincoln,\n"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me\nhe was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President\'s gaze, and so\nhis eyes met Virginia\'s.He forgot time and place,--for the while even\nthis man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the\narm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer\'s plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss\nVirginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The\ncrimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes\nshe had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I\nam not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his\nlife," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting\nand longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart\nlifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I\nshould have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice\npraise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and\nchild in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you\nto-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken\naway."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,\nknew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have\nsuffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain\nhas been my pain.And what you have\ngained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,\nand a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he\npointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a\nshaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of\nthe place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch\nthat flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And\nsometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony\njust there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of\nit was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has\ndestined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when\nthis Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what\nthey believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love\nthat flag you see there now--Washington\'s flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia\'s lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began\nto write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips\nmoving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than\never.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I\'ll have that sent to\nSherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen\nwith that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I\'ll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was\nhere making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was\nsitting behind him."\'No,\' says Tad, \'hang on to \'em.\'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to \'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia\'s\nshoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you\'ll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power\nwas given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the\nhappiness of others.he said, "I am ten\nminutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may\ncare to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can\ndo so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile\npassed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing\nand tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then\nStephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she\ncalled him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest\ntone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I\nshould have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at\nGlencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and\nnarrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until\nher heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face\nto him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than\never before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn\'t.I tried to\ninsult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,\nI used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger\nwith me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as\nI sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade\nand leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their\nhearts.ANNAPOLIS\n\nIT was Virginia\'s wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he\nlittle cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that\nbright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the\nunpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster\nof lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house\nwhich Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk\non a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led\nDorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia\nplayfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been\nwont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy\nkey that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back\nfrom England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,\nat the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had\ndescribed.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even\nas then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But\nthe tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,\nwith many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare\nfloors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of\nscenes in her great-grandfather\'s life came to Virginia.Here was the\nroom--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out\nover the deserted garden--that had been Richard\'s mother\'s.She recalled\nhow he had stolen into it on that summer\'s day after his return, and had\nflung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,\nstripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by\nwhich she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel\nCarvel\'s, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman\nhad lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other\nacross the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the\nblue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,\n"wouldn\'t it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,\nsmiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst\nof things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think\nabout."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a\nPuritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was\nsuch a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,\nfrom the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,\nand seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my\ngreat-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether\nbewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn\'t a crowded thoroughfare," said\nVirginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver\ndoor-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen\nlocked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking\ndown the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had\ndanced on the green on Richard\'s birthday.Beyond and below was the\nspring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the\nruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the\nvalley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the\noutlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years\nneglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild\ngreen things coming up through the brown of last season\'s growth.But\nin the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these\nand put them in Stephen\'s coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day\nLionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the\nwall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a\nbride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered\nin the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you\ncame over from Anne Brinsmade\'s to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,\nso sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how\nridiculous I must have been."But do\nyou know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I\nowned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners\'s\ngown, and her necklace.They were all the\nremembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade\'s gate, when we came so\nnear to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought\nus together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me\nto say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,\nI had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even\nto myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have\ngone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father\'s--such a\nsingular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that\ncurious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all\nthose people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have\ntaken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted\nto.I love you all the more for\nthat."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were\nmost strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in\nthe hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the\nNorth.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he\nanswered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln\'s death.And the\nsame thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given\nto few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr\non the very day of Christ\'s death upon the cross.And they believed that\nAbraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his\nfor the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny\nhigh upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime\nclosing words of the second inaugural:--\n\n   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the\n   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish\n   the work we are in, to bind up the nation\'s wounds, to care for him\n   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children\n   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace\n   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD\n\nThe author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story\nfor many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil\nWar, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring\nstate of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the\nremarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the\nWest.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,\nlikewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of\nemigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell\'s day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater\nColonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which\nhad characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting\nthe Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the\nkeynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country\nof ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what\nbecame the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other\nacross the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed\nalong the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther\nwest, in Kansas.The part played by\nthis people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this\nbook has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading\nclasses which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type\nof the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after \'48, is drawn\nmore or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in\nBerlin.Louis is the author\'s birthplace, and his home, the home of those\nfriends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him\nwith unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he\nsays that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those\nhe has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to\ninclude all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the\ncharacters.The breach that threatened our country\'s existence is healed\nnow.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln\'s side.And this side, with\nall reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North.I\nsuppose Albertina is there a lot.She sent me a post card for\nChristmas."Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the world.I remember how I\nused to take care of her, and put a soapstone in the small of her\nback when she was cold.I wish sometimes that I could hold your hand,\nUncle Peter, when I get thinking about it."Well, school is the same old school.Bertha Stephens has a felon on\nher finger, and that lets her out of hard work for a while.I will\nenclose a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on Emerson.It\nisn\'t very good, but it will help to fill up the envelope."Life\n\n                 "Life is a great, a noble task,\n                   When we fulfill our duty.To work, that should be all we ask,\n                   And seek the living beauty.We know not whence we come, or where\n                   Our dim pathway is leading,\n                 Whether we tread on lilies fair,\n                   Or trample love-lies-bleeding.But we must onward go and up,\n                   Nor stop to question whither.E\'en if we drink the bitter cup,\n                   And fall at last, to wither."P. S. I haven\'t got the last verse very good yet, but I think the\nsecond one is pretty.You know \'love-lies-bleeding\' is a flower, but\nit sounds allegorical the way I have put it in.*       *       *       *       *\n\nEleanor\'s fifteenth year was on the whole the least eventful year of\nher life, though not by any means the least happy.She throve\nexceedingly, and gained the freedom and poise of movement and\nspontaneity that result from properly balanced periods of work and\nplay and healthful exercise.From being rather small of her age she\ndeveloped into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and erect,\nwith a small, delicate head set flower-wise on a slim white neck.Gertrude never tired of modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor\nherself was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.She preferred\nthe snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted type of beauty, and spent many\nunhappy quarters of an hour wishing she were pretty according to the\ninexorable ideals of Harmon.She spent her vacation at David\'s apartment in charge of Mademoiselle,\nthough the latter part of the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by\nherself according to her own desire, and spent a month with her\ngrandfather, now in charge of Albertina\'s aunt.She found Albertina\ngrown into a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness, who\nplied her with endless questions concerning life in the gilded circles\nof New York society.Eleanor found her disgusting and yet possessed of\nthat vague fascination that the assumption of prerogative often\ncarries with it.She found her grandfather very old and shrunken, yet perfectly taken\ncare of and with every material want supplied.She realized as she had\nnever done before how the faithful six had assumed the responsibility\nof this household from the beginning, and how the old people had been\nwarmed and comforted by their bounty.She laughed to remember her\nsimplicity in believing that an actual salary was a perquisite of her\nadoption, and understood for the first time how small a part of the\nexpense of their living this faithful stipend had defrayed.She looked\nback incredulously on that period when she had lived with them in a\nstate of semi-starvation on the corn meal and cereals and very little\nelse that her dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the "garden\nsass," that her grandfather had faithfully hoed and tended in the\nstraggling patch of plowed field that he would hoe and tend no more.She spent a month practically at his feet, listening to his stories,\nhelping him to find his pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the\nnewspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his final acknowledgment\nthat she was a good girl and he would as soon have her come again\nwhenever she felt like it.On her way back to school she spent a week with her friend, Margaret\nLouise, in the Connecticut town where she lived with her comfortable,\ncommonplace family.It was while she was on this visit that the most\nsignificant event of the entire year took place, though it was a\nhappening that she put out of her mind as soon as possible and never\nthought of it again when she could possibly avoid it.Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and one night in the corner of\na moonlit porch, when they happened to be alone for a half hour, he\nhad asked Eleanor to kiss him."I don\'t want to kiss you," Eleanor said.Then, not wishing to convey\na sense of any personal dislike to the brother of a friend to whom\nshe was so sincerely devoted, she added, "I don\'t know you well\nenough."He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and rough tweed clothes that\nhung on him loosely."When you know me better, will you let me kiss you?""I don\'t know," Eleanor said, still endeavoring to preserve the\namenities.He took her hand and played with it softly."You\'re an awful sweet little girl," he said.He pulled her back to the\nchair from which she had half arisen."I don\'t believe in kissing _you_," she tried to say, but the words\nwould not come.She could only pray for deliverance through the\narrival of some member of the family.The boy\'s face was close to\nhers.It looked sweet in the moonlight she thought.She wished he\nwould talk of something else besides kissing."Well, then, there\'s no more to be said."His breath came heavily, with little irregular catches\nin it.She pushed him away and turned into the house."Don\'t be angry, Eleanor," he pleaded, trying to snatch at her hand."I\'m not angry," she said, her voice breaking, "I just wish you\nhadn\'t, that\'s all."There was no reference to this incident in the private diary, but,\nwith an instinct which would have formed an indissoluble bond between\nherself and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit porches and boys\nwith mischievous eyes and broad tweed covered shoulders.For her guardians too, this year was comparatively smooth running and\ncolorless.Beulah\'s militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce\nexpenditure of energy on the work that came to her hand through her\nnew interest in suffrage.Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing.She had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when their first\ndelicate desires come to naught.She was very warm-blooded and eager\nunder her cool veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work and\nhungry yearning for the fulness of a life she was too constrained to\nget any emotional hold on.Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was\nquite over and done with.Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished by the stuff that\ndreams are made of, flourished strangely in her attic chamber, and\nlearned the wisdom of life by some curious method of her own of\napprehending its dangers and delights.The only experiences she had\nthat year were two proposals of marriage, one from a timid professor\nof the romance languages and the other from a young society man,\nalready losing his waist line, whose sensuous spirit had been stirred\nby the ethereal grace of hers; but these things interested her very\nlittle.She was the princess, spinning fine dreams and waiting for the\ndawning of the golden day when the prince should come for her.Neither\nshe nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to the five-year-old vow\nof celibacy, which was to Beulah as real and as binding as it had\nseemed on the first day she took it.Peter and David and Jimmie went their own way after the fashion of\nmen, all of them identified with the quickening romance of New York\nbusiness life.David in Wall Street was proving to be something of a\nfinancier to his mother\'s surprise and amazement; and the pressure\nrelaxed, he showed some slight initiative in social matters.In fact,\ntwo mothers, who were on Mrs.Bolling\'s list as suitable\nparents-in-law, took heart of grace and began angling for him\nadroitly, while their daughters served him tea and made unabashed,\nmodern-debutante eyes at him.Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the top of his firm,\nsuffered intermittently from his enthusiastic abuse of the privileges\nof liberty and the pursuit of happiness.His mind and soul were in\nreality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was no woman among those\nwith whom he habitually foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his\nown woman.He was further rendered helpless and miserable by the fact\nthat he had not the slightest idea of his trouble.He regarded himself\nas a congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self shrank at times\nwith a revulsion of loathing.Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a rather uninspired\nearth.He was getting on in the woolen business, which happened to be\nthe vocation his father had handed down to him.He belonged to an\namusing club, and he still felt himself irrevocably widowed by the\nearly death of the girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life.It had seemed to him\nfor a few minutes at the Christmas party that she was no longer the\nlittle girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive creature--a\nwoman--had come to displace her, but when she had flung her arms\naround him he had realized that it was still the heart of a child\nbeating so fondly against his own.The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves the privileges of\nparenthood is that our native instincts are likely to become deflected\nby the substitution of the artificial for the natural responsibility.Both Peter and David had the unconscious feeling that their obligation\nto their race was met by their communal interest in Eleanor.Beulah,\nof course, sincerely believed that the filling in of an intellectual\nconcept of life was all that was required of her.Only Jimmie groped\nblindly and bewilderedly for his own.Gertrude and Margaret both\nunderstood that they were unnaturally alone in a world where lovers\nmet and mated, but they, too, hugged to their souls the flattering\nunction that they were parents of a sort.Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted young men and\nwomen, of marriageable age, with dozens of interests and sympathies in\ncommon, and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued to walk side by\nside in a state of inhuman preoccupation, their gaze fixed inward\ninstead of upon one another; and no Divine Power, happening upon the\ncurious circumstance, believed the matter one for His intervention nor\nstooped to take the respective puppets by the back of their\nunconscious necks, and so knock their sluggish heads together.CHAPTER XVI\n\nMARGARET LOUISA\'S BIRTHRIGHT\n\n\n"I am sixteen years and eight months old to-day," Eleanor wrote, "and\nI have had the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I never\nwanted to be any older.I know life is full of disillusionment and\npain, but I did not know that any one with whom you have broken bread,\nand slept in the same room with, and told everything to for four long\nyears, could turn out to be an absolute traitor and villainess.For nearly a year now I have noticed that\nBertha Stephens avoided me, and presented the appearance of disliking\nme.I don\'t like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried to do\nlittle things for her that would win back her affection, but with no\nsuccess.As I was editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes (as\nshe called them) and do her lots of little favors in a literary way,\nwhich she seemed to appreciate, but personally she avoided me like the\nplague."Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since Margaret Louise and I\nalways talked everything over we used to talk about Stevie in the same\nway.I remember that she used to try to draw me out about Stevie\'s\ncharacter.I\'ve always thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is\nthat she would say she was going to do a thing, and then from sheer\nlaziness not do it.She gummed it\nall up with her nasty fudge and then wouldn\'t give it back to me or\nget me another, but the reason she wouldn\'t give it back to me was\nbecause her feelings were too fine to return a damaged article, and\nnot fine enough to make her hump herself and get me another.That\'s\nonly one kind of a piker and not the worst kind, but it was\n_pikerish_."All this I told quite frankly to Maggie--I mean Margaret Louise,\nbecause I had no secrets from her and never thought there was any\nreason why I shouldn\'t.Stevie has a horrid brother, also, who has\nbeen up here to dances.All the girls hate him because he is so\nspoony.He isn\'t as spoony as Margaret Louise\'s brother, but he\'s\nquite a sloppy little spooner at that.Well, I told Margaret Louise\nthat I didn\'t like Stevie\'s brother, and then I made the damaging\nremark that one reason I didn\'t like him was because he looked so much\nlike Stevie.I didn\'t bother to explain to Maggie--I will not call her\nMaggie Lou any more, because that is a dear little name and sounds so\naffectionate,--Margaret Louise--what I meant by this, because I\nthought it was perfectly evident.Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a\nsnow white blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples.Well, her brother is\na snow white blond too, and he has pinky cheeks and dimples and his\nname is Carlo!We, of course, at once named him Curlo.It is not a\ngood idea for a man to look too much like his sister, or to have too\nmany dimples in his chin and cheeks.I had only to think of him in the\nsame room with my three uncles to get his number exactly.I don\'t mean\nto use slang in my diary, but I can\'t seem to help it.Professor\nMathews says that slang has a distinct function in the language--in\nreplenishing it, but Uncle Peter says about slang words, that\'many\nare called, and few are chosen,\' and there is no need to try to\naccommodate them all in one\'s vocabulary."Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things about Curlo, and how\nhe tried to hold my hand coming from the station one day, when the\ngirls all went up to meet the boys that came up for the dance,--and I\ntold her everything else in the world that happened to come into my\nhead."Then one day I got thinking about leaving Harmon--this is our senior\nyear, of course--and I thought that I should leave all the girls with\nthings just about right between us, excepting good old Stevie, who had\nthis queer sort of grouch against me.So I decided that I\'d just go\naround and have it out with her, and I did.I went into her room one\nday when her roommate was out, and demanded a show down.Well, I found\nout that Maggie--Margaret Louise had just repeated to Stevie every\nliving thing that I ever said about her, just as I said it, only\nwithout the explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of\nconversation more understandable."Stevie told me all these things one after another, without stopping,\nand when she was through I wished that the floor would open and\nswallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.I was obliged to\ngaze into Stevie\'s overflowing eyes and own up to the truth as well as\nI could, and explain it.It was the most humiliating hour that I ever\nspent, but I told Stevie exactly what I felt about her \'nothing\nextenuate, and naught set down in malice,\' and what I had said about\nher to our mutual friend, who by the way, is not the mutual friend of\neither of us any longer.We were both crying by the time I had\nfinished, but we understood each other.There were one or two things\nthat she said she didn\'t think she would ever forget that I had said\nabout her, but even those she could forgive.She said that my dislike\nof her had rankled in her heart so long that it took away all the\nbitterness to know that I wasn\'t really her enemy.She said that my\ncoming to her that way, and not lying had showed that I had lots of\ncharacter, and she thought in time that we could be quite intimate\nfriends if I wanted to as much as she did."After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against hope that Margaret\nLouise would turn out to have some reason or excuse for what she had\ndone.I knew she had done it, but when a thing like that happens that\nupsets your whole trust in a person you simply can not believe the\nevidence of your own senses.When you read of a situation like that\nin a book you are all prepared for it by the author, who has taken the\ntrouble to explain the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the\ncharacter, and given you to understand that you are to expect a\nbetrayal from him or her; but when it happens in real life out of a\nclear sky you have nothing to go upon that makes you even _believe_\nwhat you know."I won\'t even try to describe the scene that occurred between Margaret\nLouise and me.She cried and she lied, and she accused me of trying to\ncurry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a backbiter, and she\nargued and argued about all kinds of things but the truth, and when I\ntried to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled and sidestepped in\na way that was dreadful.I\'ve seen her do something like it before\nabout different things, and I ought to have known then what she was\nlike inside of her soul, but I guess you have to be the object of such\na scene before you realize the full force of it."All I said was, \'Margaret Louise, if that\'s all you\'ve got to say\nabout the injury you have done me, then everything is over between us\nfrom this minute;\' and it was, too."I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful story or poem on what I\nthought was an enduring tablet of marble, and some one had come and\nwiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on a slate.I don\'t\nknow whether it would seem like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or\nnot; I don\'t quite know whether I want to tell him.Sometimes I wish I\nhad a mother to tell such things to.It seems to me that a real mother\nwould know what to say that would help you.Disillusion is a very\nstrange thing--like death, only having people die seems more natural\nsomehow.When they die you can remember the happy hours that you spent\nwith them, but when disillusionment comes then you have lost even your\nbeautiful memories."We had for the subject of our theme this week, \'What Life Means to\nMe,\' which of course was the object of many facetious remarks from the\ngirls, but I\'ve been thinking that if I sat down seriously to state in\njust so many words what life means to _me_, I hardly know what I would\ntranscribe.It means disillusionment and death for one thing.Since my\ngrandfather died last year I have had nobody left of my own in the\nworld,--no real blood relation.Of course, I am a good deal fonder of\nmy aunts and uncles than most people are of their own flesh and blood,\nbut own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes you feel shivery to\nbe without.If I had been Margaret Louise\'s own flesh and blood, she\nwould never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as\nif he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts\nfeel that way about me, I don\'t know.I don\'t even know if I feel that\nway about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and\nfeel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don\'t feel\nthat way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am\ncertain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there\nis only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be\nUncle Peter\'s one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of\npottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live\nin forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night."CHAPTER XVII\n\nA REAL KISS\n\n\nAt seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year\nof preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah\'s heart\nthat she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher\neducation should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was\nfinally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in\nall its bearings."If she doesn\'t decide in favor of college," David said, "and she\nmakes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don\'t\nsee what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately\nnone of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet\neligible young men and that sort of thing."The two were having a cozy cup of tea at\nhis apartment."You\'re so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten\nme sometimes.""You don\'t know where I will end, is that the idea?""I don\'t know where Eleanor will end, if you\'re already thinking of\neligible young men for her.""Those things have got to be thought of," David answered gravely."I don\'t want her to be\nmarried.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone\nfor a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her\nup quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away\nwith her.If we\'ve all got to get together and connive at marrying her\noff there won\'t be any comfort in having her.""I don\'t know," David said thoughtfully; "I think that might be fun,\ntoo.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the\nmost interesting games in the world.""That\'s not my idea of an interesting game," Margaret said."I like\nthings very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.""I do know that," David said, "but it sometimes occurs to me that\nexcept for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very\nlittle about you, Margaret.""There isn\'t much to know--except that I\'m a woman.""That\'s a good deal," David answered slowly; "to a mere man that seems\nto be considerable of an adventure.""It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a\nfield of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,\nbut your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,\ndon\'t get any more, I\'ve got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it\'s\nvery improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and\nyour ancient and honorable housekeeper.""Don\'t go," David said; "I apologize on my knees for the cream.I\'ll\nsend out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that\nstate."About the cream, or the proprieties?"I\'m a little bit tired of being\none, that\'s all, and I want to go home.""She wants to go home when she\'s being so truly delightful and\ncryptic," David said."Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my\nhearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting\nher gloves to her fingers."I don\'t know exactly what it was I saw,\nbut it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the\ncreeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I\nhave a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,\ndearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of\nFrankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she\'s\ngoing to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I\nwouldn\'t say this to anybody but you, David."As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of\nowning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,\nhad his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something\nvery precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift\nhad been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more\nsilent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he\nwas dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if\nshe had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,\nbut that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights\nof stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet."I had a kind of hunch, too," he told her, "and I felt as if I wanted\nto hear your voice speaking.""If that\'s the way you feel about your chauffeur," she said, "you\nought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully."The difference between a man\'s moments of prescience and a woman\'s, is\nthat the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,\nwhile a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more\ncarefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see\nMargaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when\nhe called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone\nagain died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she\nwished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in\nthe most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an\nobsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden\ngasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of\nthe increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut\nprofile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming\nthe airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in\nthe trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea\nthat she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already\ngrown had never actually dawned on him until this moment."You look as if you were surprised to see me, Uncle David,--are you?"she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,\ninto his."You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you\nlooked as surprised as if you hadn\'t expected me at all.""Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her\nskirts to her knees.""And a blue tam-o\'-shanter?""And a blue tam-o\'-shanter.I had forgotten you had grown up any to\nspeak of.""You see me every vacation," Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the\nwaiting motor."It isn\'t because you lack opportunity that you don\'t\nnotice what I look like.It\'s just because you\'re naturally\nunobserving.""Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your\nbeing a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been\nrather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of\ntriviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has\ngrown to be a woman now.""Oh, does _he_ think I\'m grown up, does he really?"He\'s all the time wanting me to get you to\nNew York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller\nthan you were the last time he saw you.""Are they coming to see me this evening?""Jimmie is going to look in.You\nknow she\'s on here from China with her daughter."She must be as grown up as I am," Eleanor said."I used to have her\nroom, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter."Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like\na heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn\'t know that you\nadded jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.""I\'m not jealous," Eleanor protested; "or if I am it\'s only because\nshe\'s blood relation,--and I\'m not, you know.""It\'s a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody\nshould ask you," David smiled."A blood relation is a good deal like\nthe famous primrose on the river\'s brim.""\'A primrose by the river\'s brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and\nnothing more,\'" Eleanor quoted gaily."Why, what more--" she broke off\nsuddenly and  slightly."What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the\nriver\'s brim?""I don\'t know, I\'m sure.I\'m a\nmere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your\nAunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don\'t look\nunlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.""That\'s because I\'ve got a yellow ribbon on my hat."It has something to do with\nyouth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.""The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la," Eleanor returned\nsaucily, "have nothing to do with the case.""She\'s learning that she has eyes, good Lord," David said to himself,\nbut aloud he remarked paternally, "I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party\ntypes, and ourselves."Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,\nwith her hair in a braid."She\'s gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind\nof middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of\nthe same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She\'s\ngrowing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.""She\'s theory ridden and fad bitten.She\'ll come to a bad end if\nsomething doesn\'t stop her.""Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I\'m a suffragist, Uncle\nDavid.""And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the\nway she\'s going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your\nrights and unhealthy ways.Beulah\'s getting further and further off\nkey, that\'s all.Your poor old\ncooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.""This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other\nplace does," Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly\nupon her.I didn\'t know he had one," David chuckled."It takes a\nwoman--"\n\nJimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound\nbox of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the\nmoment."What\'s devouring you, papa?""Don\'t I always place\ntributes at the feet of the offspring?""Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes," David said."It\'s only\nthe labels that surprised me.""She knows the difference, now," Jimmie answered, "what would you?"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should\ngo to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and "seeing\nthe family."She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long\nvisits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at\nsuffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the\nshops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently\nwith David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out\nof the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his\nafter-dinner cigar, and watching her."I can\'t seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.""Yes, I\'d love it,--if--"\n\n"If what, daughter?""If I thought I could spare the time.""I\'m going to earn my own living, you know."I\'ve got to--in order to--to feel right about things.""Don\'t you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents\nhave accustomed you?""I love everything you\'ve ever done for me, but I can\'t go on letting\nyou do things for me forever."It doesn\'t seem--right, that\'s all.""It\'s your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious\nvarieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you\nto do good that better may come.I don\'t know whether I would be better\nfitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real\ncollege."I can\'t think,--I\'m stupefied.""Uncle Peter couldn\'t think, either.""Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?""He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I\'ll change my\nmind."Eleanor, we\'re all\nable to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided\namong six of us.When did you come to\nthis extraordinary decision?"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I\'ve never forgotten.I told Uncle\nPeter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I\nwant you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe\nthe best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I\nmight be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there\nwould be more use to me than four years at college, but I don\'t\nknow.""You\'re an extraordinary young woman," David said, staring at her."I\'m glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how\nextraordinary, but I don\'t think anything will come of it, my dear.I\ndon\'t want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you\ndo want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a\npursuit and not as a means to an end."Then let\'s have no more of this nonsense of earning your own\nliving.""Are you really displeased, Uncle David?""I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it\'s bedtime.If\nyou\'re going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on\nit immediately."Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held\nhigh.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and\nthe tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath."I thought perhaps you would understand," she said.She had always kissed him "good night" until this visit, and he had\nrefrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out\nhis hand to her."There is only one way\nfor a daughter to say good night to her parent."She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in\nher eyes."Why, Eleanor, dear," he said, "did you care?"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A\nhot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,\naccentuating the clear pallor of her face."That was a real kiss, dear," he said slowly."We mustn\'t get such\nthings confused.I won\'t bother you with talking about it to-night, or\nuntil you are ready.Until then we\'ll pretend that it didn\'t happen,\nbut if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,\nyou are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have\nsomething to say about it; will you remember?""Yes, Uncle David," Eleanor said uncertainly, "but I--I--"\n\nDavid took her unceremoniously by the shoulders."Go now," he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII\n\nBEULAH\'S PROBLEM\n\n\nPeter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner\nparty for two of her husband\'s fellow bankers and their wives.After\nthat they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from\nthere to some one of the new dancing "clubs,"--the smart cabarets that\nwere forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade\nthe two o\'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as\na usual thing enjoy bankers\' wives.He was deliberating on the\npossibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the\nplea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister\'s\nfeelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the\nclimax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his\nshaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the\nroom across the hall--Eleanor\'s room, he always called it to\nhimself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo\ninterspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather\nuncertain contralto."My last girl came from Vassar, and I don\'t know where to class her.""My last girl--" and\nbegan at the beginning of the chorus again."My last girl came from\nVassar," which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of\nthe higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her\nthat he had had with Jimmie and David the night before."She\'s off her nut," Jimmie said succinctly."It\'s not exactly that\nthere\'s nobody home," he rapped his curly pate significantly, "but\nthere\'s too much of a crowd there.She\'s not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she\'s\ngot nothing else in her head."It\'s what hasn\'t happened to her that\'s addled her," David explained."It\'s these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to\npieces under the modern pressure.They\'re the ones that need licking\ninto shape by all the natural processes.""By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?""Feminism isn\'t the answer to\nBeulah\'s problem.""It is the problem," David said; "she\'s poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack\nmarried a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,\ntemperament, and everything else, though she wasn\'t half so nice.She\ngot going the militant pace and couldn\'t stop herself.I never met her\nat a dinner party that she wasn\'t tackling somebody on the subject of\nman\'s inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they\'re\nthinking now of taking her to the--"\n\n"--bug house," Jimmie finished cheerfully."And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed\nnothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.""The frustrate matron," David agreed gravely."I wonder you haven\'t\nrealized this yourself, Gram.You\'re keener about such things than I\nam.Beulah is more your job than mine.""You\'re the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle\nher some day and see what you can do."Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline," Jimmie said."I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself\nseriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry\nabout," Peter persisted."Are you sure she\'s in bad shape--that she\'s\ngot anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its\nmost virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.""She\'s batty," Jimmie nodded gravely."Go up and look her over," David persisted; "you\'ll see what we mean,\nthen.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his\nface, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he\nhad an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to\nsee Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to\nhis friend.He had always felt that he saw\na little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the\nenergy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him\nsomething alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her\nsoundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to\nDavid."Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see\nBeulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to\ntry out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that\nit\'s serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So\'m I, to tell\nthe truth.""And so am I," Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the\nreceiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the\nladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and\ndecided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the\nthin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of\nhis effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and\nfound him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided\nthat Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and\ndelusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was\nunthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid\nvitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see\nher."Peter," she said, "I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and\ntell them that I\'ve got to go on with my work,--that I can\'t be\nstopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I\nnever felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and\nI think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world\nthey don\'t know anything about, that\'s all.Even if they were right,\nif I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,\nwhat business is it of theirs to interfere?I\'m working for the souls\nand bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if\nmy soul and body suffer?Peter\nobserved the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her\nlips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones."Because," he answered her slowly, "I don\'t think it was the original\nintention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything\nwe are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.""That isn\'t the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can\nunderstand.It\'s woman\'s equality we want emphasized, just literally\nthat and nothing more.You\'ve pauperized and degraded us long\nenough--"\n\n"Thou canst not say I--" Peter began."Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to\nit.""I had to get her going," Peter apologized to himself, "in order to\nget a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear," he\nadded aloud."If you throw your influence with us instead of against us," she\nconceded, "you\'re helping to right the wrong that you have permitted\nfor so long.""Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and\nI admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your\nbattle now is all over but the shouting.There\'s no reason that you\npersonally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign\nthat\'s practically won already.""If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,\nPeter,--"\n\n"I don\'t.I know the thousand and one activities you women are\nconcerned with.I know how much better church and state always have\nbeen and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they\nthrow their strength right."Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and\nwell for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and\nJimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her\nstate of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as\nusual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical\nincoherence."I have a right to live my own life," she concluded, "and\nnobody--nobody shall stop me.""We are all living our own lives, aren\'t we?""No woman lives her own life to-day," Beulah cried, still excitedly."Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right\nto treat her as an imbecile."How about the suffrage states, how about the women\nwho are already in the proud possession of their rights and\nprivileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to\nyour theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in\ntwo shakes,--so what\'s devouring you, as Jimmie says?""It\'s after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will\nreally begin," Beulah answered wearily."It\'s the habit of wearing the\nyoke we\'ll have to fight then.""The anti-feminists," Peter said, "I see.Beulah, can\'t you give\nyourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to\nsteady a tremulous lower lip."I am tired," she said, a little piteously, "dreadfully tired, but\nnobody cares.""They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or\nmy failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,\nthat\'s all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d\'Arc how\nmany people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn\'t\nbelieve in what she believed in?""I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position\nof women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she\'s not\ngoing to.""Not as fond as she is of Margaret."Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty."She\'s so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like\nso much dead weight.""I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you," Peter mused,\n"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You\'ll find she won\'t fail you if you need her.""I shan\'t need her," Beulah said, prophetically."I hoped she\'d stand\nbeside me in the work, but she\'s not that kind.She\'ll marry early and\nhave a family, and that will be the end of her.""I wonder if she will," Peter said, "I hope so.She still seems such\na child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don\'t you?"I made a vow once that I would never\nmarry and I\'ve always believed that it would be hampering and limiting\nto a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there\nare going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born\nof the women who are fighting to-day.""It doesn\'t make any difference why\nyou believe it, if you do believe it.""It makes all the difference," Beulah said, but her voice softened."What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,\nPeter."I understand your point of view, Beulah.You\ncarry it a little bit too far, that\'s all that\'s wrong with it from my\nway of thinking.""Will you help me to go on, Peter?"Tell them that they\'re all wrong in\ntheir treatment of me.""I think I could undertake to do that"--Peter was convinced that a\nless antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more\nsuccessful--"and I will.""You\'re the only one who comes anywhere near knowing," she said, "or\nwho ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don\'t\nseem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it\'s\nnecessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,\nevery one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and\nopposed at every turn."Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,"\nPeter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult\nthan he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and\nsubstance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and\ndiscounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the\ninterest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to\nthe cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for\nthe struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of\nbalanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming\nourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health\nand morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him\nwith the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming\nhelpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously\nresponsible for Beulah\'s condition."She wouldn\'t have run herself so far aground," he thought, "if I had\nbeen on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer\nstraighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come\nthrough all right.Now something\'s got to stop her or she can\'t be\nstopped.She\'ll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the\nsubject of equal guardianship,--and--"\n\nBeulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the\ndepths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been\ntensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears."You\'re the only one that knows," she sobbed over and over again."I\'m so tired, Peter, but I\'ve got to go on and on and on.If they\nstop me, I\'ll kill myself."Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm."Don\'t cry, dear," he said, with a hand on her head."You\'re too tired\nto think things out now,--but I\'ll help you."She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of\nthe dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the\nresemblance."I think I see the way," he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms."I think this will be the way, dear," he said very gently."Does this mean that you want me to marry you?"she whispered, when\nshe was calmer."If you will, dear," he said."I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I\'ve thought\nit all out.--Oh!"I had no idea of that," he said gravely, "but it\'s wonderful that\nyou do.I\'ll put everything I\'ve got into trying to make you happy,\nBeulah."Her arms closed around his neck and\ntightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost\nasleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his\ntenderness."I didn\'t know it could be like this," she whispered.In his heart he was saying, "This is best.It\nis the right and normal way for her--and for me."In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not\nsharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and\nyellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung\nin two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was\nbent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her\nconfession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man\nwho had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way\nbetween Eleanor\'s lids and splashed down upon her letter.CHAPTER XIX\n\nMOSTLY UNCLE PETER\n\n\n"Dear Uncle Peter," the letter ran, "I am very, very homesick and\nlonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole\nyear of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking\ninstead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and\nwrite you about the thing that is troubling me.I can\'t bear it alone\nany longer, and still I don\'t know whether it is the kind of thing\nthat it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much\ntroubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way\nthat it is terrible to think of."Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have\ngrown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my\ndearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a\nnew woman, or have \'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man\' that\nyou\'re always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once\nand for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn\'t, and\nnever has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are\nnot hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be\nmarried, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to\nanybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and\nyou in quite another way.Please don\'t try to imagine what I mean,\nUncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don\'t\nknow.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven\'t written\nyou this letter.I know people do tell things like this, but I don\'t\nknow quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have\nsomebody like you who understands everything--everything."Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by\nwhen the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until\nthat happens, I\'ve got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find\nsome way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don\'t know\nhow to tell him.I don\'t know how to make him feel that I do not\nbelong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but\nI don\'t know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it\nalready.I can\'t say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks\nthere is something different about her, but I think there are ways in\nwhich I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly\nwhat it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only\nthat, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I\nthink and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a\nwoman\'s soul that she must keep inviolate."A liberty that you haven\'t known how, or had the strength to prevent,\nis a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in\nmy life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I\nthink of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I\ndon\'t want them to, I don\'t think there would be any way of my bearing\nit.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out\nof this tangle.I don\'t see what it could be, but lots of times you\nhave shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up\ntroubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same."Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were\nhere to-night, though you wouldn\'t be let in, even if you beat on the\ngate ever so hard, for it\'s long after bedtime.I am up in my tower\nroom all alone.*       *       *       *       *\n\nEleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope\nto Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits."He would know," she said to herself."I haven\'t any real right to\ntell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling."She began another letter to him but found she could not write without\nsaying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There\nwas nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had\nmade her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet\nspell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome\ncaress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half\nforgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She\nunderstood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,\nbut that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle\nDavid.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange\nincredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her\nlips."It\'s--it\'s--like that," she said to herself."I want it to be from\nsomebody--else.Somebody that would make it\nseem right."She felt that she\nmust get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any\nman.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate\nthe way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand\n"the value of a dollar," was properly equipped to do battle with the\nrealities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to\nit--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded\nif she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had\nbestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity\nof her economic position; now that the complication of her relation\nwith David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly\nuncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration\nfrightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or\ntroubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and\nalmost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow\naccustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had\nlooked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation\nfollowing the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but\nDavid relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving\nher in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with\nMademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five\nof her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,\nshe soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and\nnormal perspective.David\'s attitude to her was as simple as ever, and\nwhen she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the\nmatter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the\ngroup.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with\nthem.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting\nfor her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she\nlooked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very\nnewly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she\nwas soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun," she wrote in her diary."He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good\nmany new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs\nas if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and\nteases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a\nstudio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the\nthree, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle\nJimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking\ninto the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him\nwhen we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at\nme, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in\nmy school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens."I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday\nand Friday,--four days of my vacation.We\'ve been to the Hippodrome\nand Chinatown, and we\'ve dined at Sherry\'s, and one night we went down\nto the little Italian restaurant where I had my first introduction to\n_eau rougie_, and was so distressed about it.I shall never forget\nthat night, and I don\'t think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing\nme about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never\nseem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about\ntaking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must\nhave telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he\nwould, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time\ntalks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very\nlittle better than not seeing him at all.He isn\'t like himself,\nsomeway.There is a shadow over him that I do not understand."*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Don\'t you think that Uncle Peter has changed?"she asked Jimmie,\nwhen the need of speaking of him became too strong to withstand."He is a little pale about the ears," Jimmie conceded, "but I think\nthat\'s the result of hard work and not enough exercise.He spends all\nhis spare time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping and\ngetting out on his horse the way he used to.He\'s doing a good job on\nthe old dear, but it\'s some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding--"\n\n"Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?"Eleanor\'s lips were dry,\nbut she did her best to make her voice sound natural.It seemed\nstrange that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition of affairs\nthat made her very heart stand still."I didn\'t know that Uncle Peter\nhad been taking care of her.""Taking care of her isn\'t a circumstance to what Peter has been doing\nfor Beulah.You know she hasn\'t been right for some time.She got\nburning wrong, like the flame on our old gas stove in the studio when\nthere was air in it.""Uncle David thought so the last time I was here," Eleanor said, "but\nI didn\'t know that Uncle Peter--"\n\n"Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to tumble.Dave and I got\nalarmed about the girl and held a consultation, with the result that\nDoctor Gramercy was called.If we\'d believed he would go into it quite\nso heavily we might have thought again before we sicked him on.It\'s\nvery nice for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as they said when\nthe lady was deposited on that already overcrowded bosom.Now Beulah\'s\ngot suffrage mania, and Peter\'s got Beulah mania, and it\'s a merry\nmess all around."You haven\'t seen much of him since you came, have\nyou?--Well, the reason is that every afternoon as soon as he can get\naway from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked \'Votes for\nWomen,\' and trundles Beulah around in her little white and green\nperambulator, trying to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks\nto her gently and persuasively upon the subject.Suffrage is the only\nsubject on her mind, he explains, so all he can do is to try to cuckoo\ngently under it day by day.It\'s a very complicated process but he\'s\nmaking headway.""I\'m glad of that," Eleanor said faintly."How--how is Aunt Gertrude?I don\'t see her very often, either."It was Jimmie\'s turn to look self-conscious."She never has time for me any more; I\'m not high-brow enough for her.She\'s getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting everywhere."She gave me a cast of her faun\'s head."She is, I guess, but don\'t let\'s waste all our valuable time talking\nabout the family.Let\'s talk about us--you and me.You ask me how I\'m\nfeeling and then I\'ll tell you.Then I\'ll ask you how you\'re feeling\nand you\'ll tell me.Then I\'ll tell you how I imagine you must be\nfeeling from the way you\'re looking,--and that will give me a chance\nto expatiate on the delectability of your appearance.I\'ll work up\ndelicately to the point where you will begin to compare me favorably\nwith all the other nice young men you know,--and then we\'ll be off."Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle a little."We shall indeed," he assured her solemnly.No, on second\nthoughts, I\'ll begin.I\'ll begin at the place where I start telling\nyou how excessively well you\'re looking.I don\'t know, considering its\nsource, whether it would interest you or not, but you have the biggest\nblue eyes that I\'ve, ever seen in all my life,--and I\'m rather a judge\nof them.""All the better to eat you with, my dear," Eleanor chanted.He shot her a queer glance from under his eyebrows."I don\'t feel very safe when I look into them, my child.It would be a\nfunny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me, wouldn\'t\nit?--well,--but away with such nonsense.I mustn\'t blither to the very\nbabe whose cradle I am rocking, must I?""I\'m not a babe, Uncle Jimmie.Peter says\nthat you even disconcert him at times, when you take to remembering\nthings out of your previous experience.""\'When he was a King in Babylon and I was a Christian Slave?\'"Only I\'d prefer to play the part of the King of Babylon, if\nit\'s all the same to you, niecelet.How does the rest of it go, \'yet\nnot for a--\' something or other \'would I wish undone that deed beyond\nthe grave.\'Gosh, my dear, if things were otherwise, I think I could\nunderstand how that feller felt.Get on your hat, and let\'s get out\ninto the open.My soul is cramped with big potentialities this\nafternoon.I wish you hadn\'t grown up, Eleanor.You are taking my\nbreath away in a peculiar manner.No man likes to have his breath\ntaken away so suddint like.Let\'s get out into the rolling prairie of\nCentral Park."But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.The Park had that\npeculiar bleakness that foreruns the first promise of spring.The\nchildren, that six weeks before were playing in the snow and six weeks\nlater would be searching the turf for dandelions, were in the listless\nbetween seasons state of comparative inactivity.There was a deceptive\nbalminess in the air that seemed merely to overlay a penetrating\nchilliness."I\'m sorry I\'m not more entertaining this afternoon," Jimmie\napologized on the way home."It isn\'t that I am not happy, or that I\ndon\'t feel the occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious; I\'m\nsilent upon a peak in Darien,--that\'s all.""I was thinking of something else, too," Eleanor said."I didn\'t say I was thinking of something else.""People are always thinking of something else when they aren\'t talking\nto each other, aren\'t they?""Something else, or each other, Eleanor.I wasn\'t thinking of\nsomething else, I was thinking--well, I won\'t tell you exactly--at\npresent."A penny is a good deal of money."I\'m afraid I couldn\'t--buy joy, even if you gave me your penny, Uncle\nJimmie."My penny might not be like other pennies.On the other\nhand, your thoughts might be worth a fortune to me.""I\'m afraid they wouldn\'t be worth anything to anybody.""You simply don\'t know what I am capable of making out of them.""I wish I could make something out of them," Eleanor said so\nmiserably that Jimmie was filled with compunction for having tired her\nout, and hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home again.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending all his time with Aunt\nBeulah," she wrote in her diary that evening."It is beautiful of him\nto try to help her through this period of nervous collapse, and just\nlike him, but I don\'t understand why it is that he doesn\'t come and\ntell me about it, especially since he is getting so tired.He ought to\nknow that I love him so dearly and deeply that I could help him even\nin helping her.It isn\'t like him not to share his anxieties with me.Aunt Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and doctors and\nnurses, and every one knows her need.It seems to me that he might\nthink that I have no one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy on\nmy heart I could only confide in him.Why doesn\'t it occur to him that I might have something to\ntell him now?He needs a good deal of exercise to\nkeep in form.If he doesn\'t have a certain amount of muscular\nactivity his digestion is not so good.There are two little creases\nbetween his eyes that I never remember seeing there before.I asked\nhim the other night when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head\nached, and he said \'no,\' but Aunt Beulah said her head ached almost\nall the time.Of course, Aunt Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter\nis trying to bring her back to normality again she is important to\nhim, and that makes her important to me for his sake also, but nobody\nin the world is worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter."I suppose it\'s a part of his great beauty that he should think so\ndisparagingly of himself.I might not love him so well if he knew just\nhow dear and sweet and great his personality is.It isn\'t so much what\nhe says or does, or even the way he looks that constitutes his charm,\nit\'s the simple power and radiance behind his slightest move.He doesn\'t think he is especially fine or beautiful.He doesn\'t know what a waste it is when he spends his strength upon\nsomebody who isn\'t as noble in character as he is,--but I know, and it\nmakes me wild to think of it.My\nvacation is almost over, and I don\'t see how I could bear going back\nto school without one comforting hour of him alone."I intended to write a detailed account of my vacation, but I can not.Uncle Jimmie has certainly tried to make me happy.I could have so much fun with him if I were not worried about\nUncle Peter!"Uncle David says he wants to spend my last evening with me.We are\ngoing to dine here, and then go to the theater together.I am going to\ntry to tell him how I feel about things, but I am afraid he won\'t give\nme the chance.Life is a strange mixture of things you want and can\'t\nhave, and things you can have and don\'t want.It seems almost disloyal\nto put that down on paper about Uncle David.I do want him and love\nhim, but oh!--not in that way.There is only one\nperson in a woman\'s life that she can feel that way about.Why--why--why doesn\'t my Uncle Peter come to me?"CHAPTER XX\n\nTHE MAKINGS OF A TRIPLE WEDDING\n\n\n"Just by way of formality," David said, "and not because I think any\none present"--he smiled on the five friends grouped about his dinner\ntable--"still takes our old resolution seriously, I should like to be\nreleased from the anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years\nago this November.I have no announcement to make as yet, but when I\ndo wish to make an announcement--and I trust to have the permission\ngranted very shortly--I want to be sure of my technical right to do\nso."Jimmie exclaimed in a tone of such genuine\nconfusion that it raised a shout of laughter."I never signed any pledge to that effect.""We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding you as a congenital\ncelibate anyway," Jimmie answered."Some day soon you will understand how much you wronged me," Peter\nsaid with a covert glance at Beulah."I wish I could say as much," Jimmie sighed, "since this is the hour\nof confession I don\'t mind adding that I hope I may be able to soon."Gertrude clapped her hands softly."We\'ve the makings of a triple\nwedding in our midst.Look into the blushing faces before us and hear\nthe voice that breathed o\'er Eden echoing in our ears.This is the\nmost exciting moment of my life!Girls, get on your feet and drink to\nthe health of these about-to-be Benedicts.Up in your chairs,--one\nslipper on the table.Gertrude had seen Margaret\'s sudden pallor and heard the convulsive\ncatching of her breath,--Margaret rising Undine-like out of a filmy,\npale green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply in the\nshadows than usual.Her quick instinct to the rescue was her own\nsalvation."On behalf of my coadjutors," he said, "I thank you.All this is\nextremely premature for me, and I imagine from the confusion of the\nother gentlemen present it is as much, if not more so, for them.Personally I regret exceedingly being unable to take you more fully\ninto my confidence.The only reason for this partial revelation is\nthat I wished to be sure that I was honorably released from my oath of\nabstinence.You fellows say something," he concluded,\nsinking abruptly into his chair."Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian," Jimmie murmured."I\'ve got nothing to say, except that I wish I had something to say\nand that if I _do_ have something to say in the near future I\'ll\ncreate a real sensation!When Miss Van Astorbilt permits David to link\nher name with his in the caption under a double column cut in our\nleading journals, you\'ll get nothing like the thrill that I expect to\ncreate with my modest announcement.I\'ve got a real romance up my\nsleeve."There is no Van Astorbilt in mine.""The lady won\'t give me her permission to speak," Peter said."She\nknows how proud and happy I shall be when I am able to do so.""It is better we should marry," she said."I didn\'t realize that when\nI exacted that oath from you.It is from the intellectual type that\nthe brains to carry on the great work of the world must be\ninherited."I\'ll destroy it to-night and then we may all consider\nourselves free to take any step that we see fit.It was really only as\na further protection to Eleanor that we signed it.""Eleanor will be surprised, won\'t she?"Three\nself-conscious masculine faces met her innocent interrogation."_Eleanor_," Margaret breathed, "_Eleanor_.""I rather think she will," Jimmie chuckled irresistibly, but David\nsaid nothing, and Peter stared unseeingly into the glass he was still\ntwirling on its stem."Eleanor will be taken care of just the same," Beulah said decisively."I don\'t think we need even go through the formality of a vote on\nthat.""Eleanor will be taken care of," David said softly.The Hutchinsons\' limousine--old Grandmother Hutchinson had a motor\nnowadays--was calling for Margaret, and she was to take the two other\ngirls home.David and Jimmie--such is the nature of men--were\ndisappointed in not being able to take Margaret and Gertrude\nrespectively under their accustomed protection."I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude," Jimmie said reproachfully as she\nslipped away from his ingratiating hand on her arm."I thought I should take you home to-night, Margaret," David said;\n"you never gave me the slip before.""The old order changeth," Gertrude replied lightly to them both, as\nshe preceded Margaret into the luxurious interior."It\'s Eleanor," Gertrude announced as the big car swung into Fifth\nAvenue."Jimmie or David--or--or both are going to marry Eleanor.Didn\'t you\nsee their faces when Beulah spoke of her?""David wants to marry Eleanor," Margaret said quietly."I\'ve known it\nall winter--without realizing what it was I knew.""Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?""Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?"it doesn\'t make any difference,--we\'re losing them just the same.""No matter what combinations come\nabout, we shall still have an indestructible friendship.""Indestructible friendship--shucks," Gertrude cried."The boys are\ngoing to be married--married--married!Marriage is the one thing that\nindestructible friendships don\'t survive--except as ghosts.""It should be Peter who is going to marry Eleanor," Margaret said."It\'s Peter who has always loved her best."As a friend," Beulah said, "as her dearest friend.""Not as a friend," Margaret answered softly, "she loves him."I believe it," Gertrude said.Of\ncourse, it must be Peter who is going to marry her.""If it isn\'t we\'ve succeeded in working out a rather tragic\nexperiment," Margaret said, "haven\'t we?""Life is a tragic experiment for any woman," Gertrude said\nsententiously."Peter doesn\'t intend to marry Eleanor," Beulah persisted."Do you happen to know who he is going to marry?""Yes, I do know, but I--I can\'t tell you yet.""Whoever it is, it\'s a mistake," Margaret said."It\'s our little\nEleanor he wants.I suppose he doesn\'t realize it himself yet, and\nwhen he does it will be too late.He\'s probably gone and tied himself\nup with somebody entirely unsuitable, hasn\'t he, Beulah?""I don\'t know," Beulah said; "perhaps he has.I hadn\'t thought of it\nthat way.""It\'s the way to think of it, I know."Margaret\'s eyes filled with\nsudden tears."But whatever he\'s done it\'s past mending now.There\'ll\nbe no question of Peter\'s backing out of a bargain--bad or good, and\nour poor little kiddie\'s got to suffer.""Beulah took it hard," Gertrude commented, as they turned up-town\nagain after dropping their friend at her door.The two girls were\nspending the night together at Margaret\'s.I think besides being devoted to Eleanor, she feels terrifically\nresponsible for her.I can\'t pretend to think of anything else,--who--who--who--are\nour boys going to marry?""I don\'t know, Gertrude.""I always thought that you and David--"\n\nMargaret met her eyes bravely but she did not answer the implicit\nquestion."I always thought that you and Jimmie--" she said presently.Gertrude, you would have been so good for him."it\'s all over now," Gertrude said, "but I didn\'t know that a\nliving soul suspected me."Gertrude whispered as they clung to each\nother.I\'ve never seen any one else whom I thought that of.I--I was so\nused to him.""That\'s the rub," Gertrude said, "we\'re so used to them.They\'re\nso--so preposterously necessary to us."Late that night clasped in each other\'s arms they admitted the extent\nof their desolation.Life had been robbed of a magic,--a mystery.The\nsolid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding was the\nbackground of so much lovely folly, so many unrealized possibilities,\nso many nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution of\ntheir circle was an unthinkable calamity."We ought to have put out our hands and taken them if we wanted them,"\nGertrude said, out of the darkness.They need to be firmly\nturned in the right direction instead of being given their heads."I wouldn\'t pay that price for love," Margaret said.By\nthe time I had made it happen I wouldn\'t want it.""That\'s my trouble too," Gertrude said.Then she turned over on her\npillow and sobbed helplessly."Jimmie had such ducky little curls,"\nshe explained incoherently."I do this sometimes when I think of them.Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after Gertrude\'s breath began\nto rise and fall regularly, she lay staring wide-eyed into the\ndarkness.CHAPTER XXI\n\nELEANOR HEARS THE NEWS\n\n\n"Dear Uncle Jimmie:\n\n"I said I would write you, but now that I have taken this hour in\nwhich to do it, I find it is a very, very hard letter that I have got\nto write.In the first place I can\'t believe that the things you said\nto me that night were real, or that you were awake and in the world of\nrealities when you said them.I felt as if we were both dreaming; that\nyou were talking as a man does sometimes in delirium when he believes\nthe woman he loves to be by his side, and I was listening the same\nway.It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.I can\'t help\nfeeling that your idea of me is a dream idea, and the pain that you\nsaid this kind of a letter would give you will be merely dream pain.It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find that all the lovely\nways we felt, and delicately beautiful things we had, were only dream\nthings that we wouldn\'t even understand if we were thoroughly awake."In the second place, you can\'t want to marry your little niecelet,\nthe funny little \'kiddo,\' that used to burn her fingers and the\nbeefsteak over that old studio gas stove.We had such lovely kinds of\nmake-believe together.That\'s what our association always ought to\nmean to us,--just chumship, and wonderful and preposterous _pretends_.I couldn\'t think of myself being married to you any more than I could\nJack the giant killer, or Robinson Crusoe.You\'re my truly best and\ndearest childhood\'s playmate, and that is a great deal to be, Uncle\nJimmie.I don\'t think a little girl ever grows up quite _whole_ unless\nshe has somewhere, somehow, what I had in you.You wouldn\'t want to\nmarry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?There are some kinds of\nplaymates that can\'t marry each other.I think that you and I are that\nkind, Uncle Jimmie."My dear, my dear, don\'t let this hurt you.How can it hurt you, when\nI am only your little adopted foster child that you have helped\nsupport and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?I love you so\nmuch,--you are so precious to me that you _must_ wake up out of this\ndistorted, though lovely dream that I was present at!Nobody can break our hearts if we are strong\nenough to withhold them.Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find\nthe way to be our bravest all the time.I know that what you are\nfeeling now is not real.I can\'t tell you how I know, but I do know\nthe difference.They could be pulled up\nwithout too terrible a havoc."Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me.I said this would be a\nhard letter to write, and it has been.If you could see my poor\ninkstained, weeping face, you would realize that I am only your funny\nlittle Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously at all.I hope\nyou will come up for my graduation.When you see me with all the other\nlumps and frumps that are here, you will know that I am not worth\nconsidering except as a kind of human joke."Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie that Margaret\nspending a week-end in a town in Connecticut adjoining that in which\nEleanor\'s school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her\novernight at the inn where she was staying.She had really planned the\nentire expedition for the purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her\nfor the revelations that were in store for her, though she was\nostensibly meeting a motoring party, with which she was going on into\nthe Berkshires.She started in abruptly, as was her way, over the salad and cheese in\nthe low studded Arts and Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road\nhouse, contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty woman in new\nsporting clothes."Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are going to be married," she\ntold her."No, I didn\'t," Eleanor said faintly, but she grew suddenly very\nwhite.David gave a dinner party one night last\nweek in his studio, and announced his intentions, but we don\'t know\nthe name of the lady yet, and we can\'t guess it.He says it is not a\nsociety girl.""Who do you think it is, Eleanor?""I--I can\'t think, Aunt Margaret.""We don\'t know who Jimmie is marrying either.The facts were merely\ninsinuated, but he said we should have the shock of our lives when we\nknew.""Perhaps he has changed his mind by now," Eleanor said.Don\'t you think it might be that they both just\nthought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn\'t want to\nmarry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.""I don\'t think it\'s a mistake.Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had\nanticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the\nsensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to\ntell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from\nthe pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have\nbeen shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were\nconnecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity\nnightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in\nMargaret\'s memory for many years."It would have been easier to tell\nher in her street clothes," she thought."I wish her profile were not\nso perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely\nthing?""Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?""The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now\nthat I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn\'t show my\nfeelings through.Haven\'t you noticed how much more like other people\nI\'ve grown, Eleanor?""You\'ve grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don\'t think you\'re\nvery much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.""I have though,--every one notices it.You haven\'t asked me anything\nabout Peter yet," she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor\'s cheeks for an instant."I haven\'t heard from him for a\nlong time.""Yes, he\'s well," Margaret said."He\'s looking better than he was for\na while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor."He\nsaid that he hadn\'t the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We\'re as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.""It\'s Aunt Beulah," Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of\nher.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face\nand a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it."I don\'t think it\'s Beulah," Margaret said."Beulah knows who it is,\nbut I never thought of it\'s being Beulah herself.""If she knows--then she\'s the one.He wouldn\'t have told her first if\nshe hadn\'t been.""Don\'t let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It\'s--it\'s pain to us all.""Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?""Yes, dear," Margaret smiled at her bravely."And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?""She has for a good many years, I think.""I didn\'t know that," she said.She\npushed Margaret\'s arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard."Don\'t touch me," she cried, "I can\'t bear it.You might not want\nto--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw\nher head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,\nas if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in\nthe night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from\nthe room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of\nexhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape."Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train," the clerk\nsaid, "and left this note for Miss Hutchinson."It was like Eleanor to\ndo things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Dear Aunt Margaret," her letter ran."My grandmother used to say that\nsome people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid\nthat is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder."I\'ve been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,\nand I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don\'t think I have any right to\ntell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found\nto be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such\nbeautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each\nother, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little\nblinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the\nway, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt\nMargaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go\nwrong.I was so young, I didn\'t know how to manage.I shall never be\nthat kind of young again."You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one\nelse know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,\ndon\'t you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange\nit so they wouldn\'t try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me\nnaturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the\nriver, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won\'t be\nany use in trying to find me.I couldn\'t\never bear seeing one of your faces again.Don\'t let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don\'t want him\nto know,--I don\'t want to hurt him, and I don\'t want him to know.Good-by, my dears, my dearests.I\nhave taken all of my allowance money.CHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE SEARCH\n\n\nEleanor had not bought a ticket at the station, Margaret ascertained,\nbut the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him\nand told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a\nlank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with\nEleanor\'s charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his\nattitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure\nmade Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to\nproceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the\nschool, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school\noffice and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a\nsomewhat lame story to account for Eleanor\'s absence and promised the\nauthorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a\npromise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not\nkeep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the\nothers.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor\nhad left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,\nthey faced David and Jimmie."She went away," Margaret told them, "both because she felt she was\nhurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.""I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,"\nMargaret answered deliberately."If that is true," he said, "then I am largely responsible for her\ngoing.""It is I who am responsible," Jimmie groaned aloud."I asked her to\nmarry me and she refused me.""I asked her to marry me and didn\'t give her the chance to refuse,"\nDavid said; "it is that she is running away from.""It was Peter\'s engagement that was the last straw," Margaret said."The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I\ntold her that.""The damned hound--" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology."Eleanor says it\'s Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think\nthat she\'s probably right.""That would be a nice mess, wouldn\'t it?""Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of\njudgment, Margaret?I don\'t covet the sweet job of breaking it to\neither one of them."Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that\nsame afternoon at Beulah\'s apartment."I\'ll find her," Peter said briefly.And in response to the halting\nexplanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done\ntheir best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he\nonly said, "I don\'t see that it makes any difference why she\'s gone.She\'s gone, that\'s the thing that\'s important.No matter how hard we\ntry we can\'t really figure out her reason till we find her.""Are you sure it\'s going to be so easy?"She\'s a pretty determined little person when she\nmakes up her mind.Eleanor\'s threats are to be taken seriously."I\'ll find her if she\'s anywhere in the world," Peter said."I\'ll find\nher and bring her back.""I believe that you will," she said."Find out the reason that she\nwent away, too, Peter."Beulah pulled Gertrude aside."She had some one else\non her mind, hadn\'t she?""She had something else on her mind," Gertrude answered gravely, "but\nshe had Peter on her mind, too.""She didn\'t--she couldn\'t have known about us--Peter and me.We--we\nhaven\'t told any one."It\'s\njust one of God\'s most satirical mix-ups.""I was to blame," Beulah said slowly."I don\'t believe in shifting\nresponsibility.I got her here in the first place and I\'ve been\ninstrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I\'ve sacrificed her\nto my own happiness.""It isn\'t so simple as that," Gertrude said; "the things we start\ngoing soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has\nbeen directing Eleanor\'s affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for\nthat matter.""Don\'t worry, Beulah," Peter said, making his way to her side from the\nother corner of the room where he had been talking to Margaret."You\nmustn\'t let this worry you.We\'ve all got to be--soldiers now,--but\nwe\'ll soon have her back again, I promise you.""And I promise you," Beulah said chokingly, "that if you\'ll get her\nback again, I--I will be a soldier."*       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding\nout the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly\nto her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine\noffice, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt\nalmost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund\nin her name started some years before for the defraying of her college\nexpenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even\nthough she felt constrained to pay it back later on.He worked on this\ntheory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her\nin the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor\'s effects sent on from the school was a little red\naddress book containing the names and addresses of many of her former\nschoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing\nher speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him\nany news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina\'s aunt, who had\nserved in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor\'s grandfather in his\nlast days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who\nintimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to\nsome bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the\napparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their\nefforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching\nthrough boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing\nthe editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in\nthe hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position\nthere; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of\nthe professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient\nsearch was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the\nsurface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a\nmatter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and\nabortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a\ngirl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude\nsix determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax\ntheir resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact\nremained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the\ncruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions\nthat had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her\ndearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all\ntheir young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the\nliving clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had\nmolded as nearly as possible to their hearts\' desire.They loved her\nfor herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of\nher--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that\nmight so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened\nfor her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and\nmeeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only\nMargaret had any sense of peace about her."I\'m sure she\'s all right," she said; "I feel it.It\'s hard having her\ngone, but I\'m not afraid for her.She\'ll work it out better than we\ncould help her to.It\'s a beautiful thing to be young and strong and\nfree, and she\'ll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you\'re right, Margaret," David said.It\'s the bread and butter end of the problem that worries\nme.""He\'ll provide for our ewe lamb, I\'m\nsure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the\nstrain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her\nthe letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling\nthrough her tears."She\'s a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,\nJimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I\nthought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she\nwas Peter\'s,--had been Peter\'s all the time, the thought somehow cured\nme.I made it up out of the stuff that\ndreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing\nhas gone out of it.She\'s my little lost child,--or my sister.A man\nwants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I\'m at sea again.I thought that I\ncared,--that I was anchored for good.It\'s the drifting that plays the\ndeuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her\nloss can\'t hold me, what can?"I don\'t know," Gertrude laughed.You\'ve always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so\nto have any respect for me, I guess.You\'ve got your work," he waved\nhis arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,\n"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I\'m a poor\nrudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don\'t know it," he said, with an effort to conceal\nthe fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a\nhuman soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew\nthe boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to\nher breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her\nwhole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE YOUNG NURSE\n\n\nThe local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles\nfrom Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies\nwas located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but\nfor the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the\nbreak in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,\nold colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence\nfor which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread\nthin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was\ncovered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the\nwindow-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were\ntalking together in low tones during the hour of the patients\'\nsiestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled\ndelicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before\nthem, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about\nthem, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were\ndressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of\nthe probationary period.A light breeze blew in at\nthe window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the\nstarched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the\ninsect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing\nmotor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless\nmoan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of\noblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to\nthe patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady\nwho had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case\nasked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing\nof young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to\nher a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are\nsleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly\nup at Eleanor."I hoped \'twould be you," she said, "and then after I\'d rung I lay in\nfear and trembling lest one o\' them young flipperti-gibbets should\ncome, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I\nwant to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that\'s better, or whether it just seems better to me,\nbecause \'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You\ncertainly have got a soothin\' and comfortin\' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more\nhospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I\nremember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There\'s nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady\nsighed.That other nurse--that black\nhaired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I\npity a young girl alone in the world.""It\'s all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy\nenough," Eleanor said."But you mustn\'t talk any more.I\'m going to\ngive you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring\nmotionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some\ndozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens\nlived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to\ndraw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on\nthe board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had\nbeen admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind\nher.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an\neditorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of\nher life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing\nleft of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the\nhurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,\nand where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her\nown value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she\nwas held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have\nrelieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the\ntemperament that finds a virtue in the day\'s work, and a balm in its\nmere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good\nnurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general\nfavorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens\' home.Bertha Stephens had been\nthe one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to\ncirculate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the\nlittle red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had\nprecipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing\nbetween Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo\nStephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens\ncovertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens\' home a\nvery comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,\nmotherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious\nlove-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any\nof her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and\nsolace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old\nwoman on the King\'s Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be\nI. Sometimes I wonder what \'being I\' consists of, anyway.I used to\nfeel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as\nprotoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a\ndifferent cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I\ngot them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am\nno more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of \'what\nam I?\'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer\nthan ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in\nexistence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses\nyesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the\nconsciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_\nus day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is\nleft?I look in the glass, and see\nthe same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow\nshaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to\nher mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and\nfind that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but\nthere the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I\'m a young nurse\nnow in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as\nshouldn\'t; but that\'s all I am.Otherwise, I\'m not anybody _to_\nanybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn\'t\ncount in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell\nme.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I\'m glad I\'m that, but\nthere used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some\nheart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn\'t seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an\nauk\'s egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it\nand squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle\nPeter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,\nand she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day\nis to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to\nlove a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out\nof it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved\nso they could not tear their love out of their hearts without\nlacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the\nworld,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature\nwere made from it,--why haven\'t people more sympathy for it?Why isn\'t\nthere more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but\nit is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find\n\'Him whom your soul loveth.\'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken\nwoman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she\nseems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to\nhelp it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular\ncook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said\nI would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and\nmake some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more\nto-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It\nis wicked to speak of Doctor Blake\'s clean cut work as butchery, but\nwhen you actually see a child\'s leg severed from its body, what else\ncan you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting\nor crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by\nthe operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the\nassisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber\nstanding there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of\nthe unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass\nthrough my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or\nwas dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready\nfor their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don\'t\nthink there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it\nthat way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope\nthat we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I\nheld his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat\nDoctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the\nanesthetist.\'Take long breaths, Benny,\' I said, and he breathed in\nbravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the\nether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened\nto me while that operation was going on.I think\nthe spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew\nwhat it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without\nwhat his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can\'t explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as\nif there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some\nstrange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not\nwant any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to\ndraw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up\nwithin me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long\nwithout any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt\nMargaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night\nhow anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep\nmy feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that\nI took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and\nbeautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would\nlie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my\nown rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my\ndear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and\ncruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV\n\nCHRISTMAS AGAIN\n\n\nThe ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour\nbefore dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting\ncompanionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,\nwhere a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the\ncouch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You\'re an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of\nus up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you\npine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on\nChristmas.It isn\'t like\nChristmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David\'s eyes kindled at the\nreminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands\nabout her knees."I haven\'t seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped\nherself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,\nshe flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it\'s\ngetting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn\'t find things\ninteresting unless they were personal.\'I like things very personal,\'\nyou said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is\nfrozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that\nsame occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field\nof clover in an insectless world.You don\'t feel that way nowadays,\nsurely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this\nwinter.I\'ve counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a\nbutterfly and a worm.""I didn\'t know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn\'t put your foot down firmly on the worm, I\nhad every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had\na queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling\nthat she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer\ntrouble upon us.""I\'m not so sure that\'s the way to put it," David said gravely."We\nbrought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David\ncorrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth\nabout that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and\nbefore I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love\nto her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,\nunrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other\nidea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started\nthings going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It\nnever occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on\ntrying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at\nevery turn."With characteristic idiocy I was\nkeeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran\naway to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right\ntoo.If I weren\'t haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring\nin the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she\'s\nshaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who\nis smashed, though."You wouldn\'t smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn\'t wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you\nthink the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is \'yes,\' as you very well know.Time was when we\nwere very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each\nother.I\'m beginning to realize that it hasn\'t been the same world\nsince and isn\'t likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them\nthere.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn\'t\nit?""I don\'t know," Margaret said, "I don\'t know."She flashed a sudden\nodd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my\nlife."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach\nher hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he\naccomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You\'re a\nlovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you\nand hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the\nEleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn\'t\nhave liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,\nand she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I\'m a settling kind of person?""She wouldn\'t if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you\'ll do."Maybe I\'d like them better considered as connections of yours,"\nMargaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it\nswiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and\nstood poised in the doorway."I\'m going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she\nanswered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and\ncobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers\ntrellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone\nwith her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor\'s parting letter, and he was\nprofoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor\'s absence became an almost\nunendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a\nfunction that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David\'s\nstudio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we\'ve got presents\nfor one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her\ngoing away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our\nlives in order to bring us closer together.We\'ll get closer together\nfor her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had\nreckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to\nthe mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on\nthe couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he\nadded his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it\nfor her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of\ncourse we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party\ncoat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie\nsays, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always\ncarrying around those big volumes.""You\'re looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I\'m looking more human.I guess perhaps that\'s it,--I\'m\nfeeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of\nsome--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah\'s chair-arm, and\nslipped an arm around her."You\'re all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I\ngot on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My\nfaithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to\nbelieve he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I\nfound a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don\'t think she\'s doing anything like that," Jimmie\nexclaimed."I don\'t know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike\nhimself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow\nwas too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a\nde-tec-i-tive, I\'m afraid I\'m a failure.""We\'re all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor\'s empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her\nthimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room\nin which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost\ntoo much for them.Peter shaded\nhis eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each\nother\'s hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won\'t do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,\nsitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the\ncenterpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we\nfeast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don\'t see why," Jimmie argued."I\'m in favor of each man howling\ninformally as he listeth.""Let\'s drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the\nSauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this\ncontingency.Here\'s to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant\nafter the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell\nrang."Don\'t let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound\nof parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her\nlips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped\noff her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and\nstood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres\nthat separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at\nthe sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You\'re drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms\nto them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for\nrunning away from you?"CHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE LOVER\n\n\nThey left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval\nbefore the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his\neyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular\nappearance between the portieres."I\'m not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped\nby him to the door, "don\'t think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood\nfacing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor\'s little head up and her\nbreath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could\nyou,--how could you?""I\'m back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I\'m sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought\nit would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I\'ve suffered so\nmuch--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the\nsuffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the\nshoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,\nbeseechingly.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I\nought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down\nto New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing\nthings.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as\nstrong as Dante was, when he\'showed himself more furnished with\nbreath than he was,\' and said, \'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.\'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to\nhave."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I\nknow Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did\nmy going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear\nto think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face\nevery other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give\nher back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,\nand we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him\nalways as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don\'t\nthink he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do\nright, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just\nthe way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don\'t men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be\nstruggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make\nthemselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women\nlove it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I\nsaw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in\nhis eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is\nalways so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,\nwhen Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the\nfirst time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their\nattitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm\nlook of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and\na tender chivalrous heart.It means being a\ngood man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don\'t\nknow how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah\'s experience with him has been\nthe thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the\nhuman cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before\nshe could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the\nkind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a\nsurgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than\nharm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on\nfeeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book\nto-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to\nmy children when love comes to them.\'This is the way I felt,\' I want\nto say to them, \'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to\nme.\'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you\never thought you could be.It means knowing what you are, and what you\nwere meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be\npurified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in\nit.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,\nand shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow\ndim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your\ninner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing\nto be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are\neverlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like\nthis.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their\nbeing drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth\nabout the universe.It is the rainbow of God\'s promise set over the\nland.There comes with it the soul\'s certainty of living on and on\nthrough time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter\'s loving me isn\'t the important\nthing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;\nmy knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me\nbefore; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated\nand true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any\nmisunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the\npoetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like\nhis mother).When I say that he is not stronger or\nwiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way\nhe behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is\nstronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his\nand gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is\nin the world."I haven\'t written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can\'t look over my shoulder on to this page, for they\nwould not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but\nme.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,\n\'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can\'t tell you what\nlove meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing\nto you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back\nto them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a\ngarment when love came.\'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the\nfeeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to\nturn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and\n_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter\nwill be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established\nin my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are\nthere,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my\nlittle children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world\nthat has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that\nprovided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan\never had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."What is the common name\n

nerve of\nsight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not\nbear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing\nwe see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that\nthe nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While\nwriting, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;\nthen the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good\ncare of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the\npupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light\nis too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: "Let us see\nwhich of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time."Then they foolishly began to look at the sun.The delicate nerves of\nsight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as\npossible and the eyelid curtains put down.They were trying to see which would bear\nit the longest.Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of\nboth these boys.The one who looked longest at the sun died in\nconsequence of his foolish act.The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to\nimitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed.He turned them; but he could\nnot turn them back again.Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty\nyears old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors\nhave never been able to set them quite right.You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your\neyes too much light.But you must also be sure to give them light\nenough.When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:\n"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark."If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in\nplace of them, and you would never be able to see again.What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to\ncatch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears.These are deeper\nin the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account\nof each sound to the brain.The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye.Careless children\nsometimes put pins into their ears and so break the "drum."That is a\nvery bad thing to do.Use only a soft towel in washing your ears.You\nshould never put any thing hard or sharp into them.I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small\nboy.One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the\ndoor, to feel the wind blow into it.He was so young that he did not\nknow it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache.He thought\nit began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that\ndoor.ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,\nis nerve work.The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,\ntaste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought.His hands tremble, his\nspeech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor\nnerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and\nhearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?Where should the light be for reading or\n          studying?Tell the story of the boys who looked at the\n          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself\n          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill\n          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by\n          drinking liquor?"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm," says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm\nvery quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make\nhis blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,\nhe puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your\ntongue, the mercury (m[~e]r\'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out\nof doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold\none, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes\nthis heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of\nthe body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the\nwarmer we feel.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why\nchildren are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A\ngreat deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off\nthrough your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a\nroom full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to\nprevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much\nheat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments\nkeep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be\nworn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they\nare not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the\nseason, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and\nhandsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.This will make the hot\nblood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should\nput on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep\nwarm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are\nsometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one\npart fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside\nskin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or\na cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,\nas a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a\nburning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the\nskin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to\ncarry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be\ncolder than before.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating\nalcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to\nthe brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and\nmay freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but\nthey would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter\nday.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them\nwarm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold\nout best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose\nships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by\ndogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus\nmeat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know\nwhy.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say\nthe same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens\ntheir power to resist cold.[Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]\n\nMany of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from\nthe Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many\nmonths.Seven were\nfound alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward.The\nfirst man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a\ndrunkard.Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco.Of the six now\nliving,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble.It had probably\nweakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of\nsuch poor food as they had.Why do you wear thick clothes in cold weather?How can you prove that you are warm inside?How can you warm yourself without going to the\n          fire?How does it cheat you into thinking that you\n          will be warmer for drinking it?What do the people who travel in very cold\n          countries, tell us about the use of alcohol?How did tobacco affect the men who went to the\n          Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?[Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what\nalcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a\ngreat deal of money.Money spent for that which will do no good, but\nonly harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save\na dollar.You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar.What\nwould the beer-drinker do with it?If he takes two mugs of beer a day,\nthe dollar will be used up in ten days.But we ought not to say used,\nbecause that word will make us think it was spent usefully.We will say,\ninstead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost\nmore.If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not\nso often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched.We should not need so\nmany policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now.If no liquor was\ndrunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.Most of you have a little money of your own.Perhaps you earned a part,\nor the whole of it, yourselves.You are planning what to do with it, and\nthat is a very pleasant kind of planning.Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little\nroll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?(_See Frontispiece._)\n\nYes!It would be worse than wasted,\nif, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it.If you\nshould buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could\nsoon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six\nhundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent\nin this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than\nwasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any\ngood to the world by the change?How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for\n          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a\n          dollar bill.How much money is spent for tobacco, yearly, in\n          this country?*       *       *       *       *\n\nTranscriber\'s Notes:\n\nThis book contains pronunciation codes.These are indicated in the text\nby the following\n\n          breve: [)i]\n

miles, the population, and amount of the present Revenue I will\nfind an opportunity of making some use of it.When the formalities of\nthe cession are compleated, the next thing will be to take possession,\nand I think it would be very consistent for the President of the United\nStates to do this in person."What is Dayton gone to New Orleans for?Is he there as an Agent for the\nBritish as Blount was said to be?"Of the same date is a letter to Senator Breck-enridge, of Kentucky,\nforwarded through Jefferson:\n\n"My Dear Friend,--Not knowing your place of Residence in Kentucky I send\nthis under cover to the President desiring him to fill up the direction."I see by the public papers and the Proclamation for calling Congress,\nthat the cession of Louisiana has been obtained.The papers state the\npurchase to be 11,250,000 dollars in the six per cents and 3,750,000\ndollars to be paid to American claimants who have furnished supplies to\nFrance and the french Colonies and are yet unpaid, making on the whole\n15,000,000 dollars."I observe that the faction of the Feds who last Winter were for going\nto war to obtain possession of that country and who attached so much\nimportance to it that no expense or risk ought be spared to obtain it,\nhave now altered their tone and say it is not worth having, and that\nwe are better without it than with it."The second section of the 2d article of the constitution says, The\n\'President shall have Power by and with the consent of the senate to\nmake Treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur.\'"A question may be supposed to arise on the present case, which is,\nunder what character is the cession to be considered and taken up in\ncongress, whether as a treaty, or in some other shape?"Though the word, Treaty, as a Word, is unlimited in its meaning\nand application, it must be supposed to have a denned meaning in the\nconstitution.It there means Treaties of alliance or of navigation and\ncommerce--Things which require a more profound deliberation than\ncommon acts do, because they entail on the parties a future reciprocal\nresponsibility and become afterwards a supreme law on each of the\ncontracting countries which neither can annull.But the cession of\nLouisiana to the United States has none of these features in it It is a\nsale and purchase.A sole act which when finished, the parties have no\nmore to do with each other than other buyers and sellers have.It has no\nfuture reciprocal consequences (which is one of the marked characters of\na Treaty) annexed to it; and the idea of its becoming a supreme law\nto the parties reciprocally (which is another of the characters of a\nTreaty) is inapplicable in the present case.There remains nothing for\nsuch a law to act upon."I love the restriction in the constitution which takes from the\nExecutive the power of making treaties of his own will: and also the\nclause which requires the consent of two thirds of the Senators, because\nwe cannot be too cautious in involving and entangling ourselves with\nforeign powers; but I have an equal objection against extending the\nsame power to the senate in cases to which it is not strictly and\nconstitutionally applicable, because it is giving a nullifying power\nto a minority.Treaties, as already observed, are to have future\nconsequences and whilst they remain, remain always in execution\nexternally as well as internally, and therefore it is better to run the\nrisk of losing a good treaty for the want of two thirds of the senate\nthan be exposed to the danger of ratifying a bad one by a small\nmajority.But in the present case no operation is to follow but what\nacts itself within our own Territory and under our own laws.We are the\nsole power concerned after the cession is accepted and the money paid,\nand therefore the cession is not a Treaty in the constitutional meaning\nof the word subject to be rejected by a minority in the senate."The question whether the cession shall be accepted and the bargain\nclosed by a grant of money for the purpose, (which I take to be the\nsole question) is a case equally open to both houses of congress, and\nif there is any distinction of _formal right_, it ought according to\nthe constitution, as a money transaction, to begin in the house of\nRepresentatives."I suggest these matters that the senate may not be taken unawares, for\nI think it not improbable that some Fed, who intends to negative the\ncession, will move to take it up as if it were a Treaty of Alliance or\nof Navigation and Commerce."The object here is an increase of territory for a valuable\nconsideration.It is altogether a home concern--a matter of domestic\npolicy.The only real ratification is the payment of the money, and as\nall verbal ratification without this goes for nothing, it would be a\nwaste of time and expense to debate on the verbal ratification distinct\nfrom the money ratification.The shortest way, as it appears to me,\nwould be to appoint a committee to bring in a report on the President\'s\nMessage, and for that committee to report a bill for the payment of the\nmoney.The french Government, as the seller of the property, will not\nconsider anything ratification but the payment of the money contracted\nfor."There is also another point, necessary to be aware of, which is, to\naccept it in toto.Any alteration or modification in it, or annexed as\na condition is so far fatal, that it puts it in the power of the other\nparty to reject the whole and propose new Terms.There can be no such\nthing as ratifying in part, or with a condition annexed to it and\nthe ratification to be binding.It is still a continuance of the\nnegociation."It ought to be presumed that the American ministers have done to the\nbest of their power and procured the best possible terms, and that being\nimmediately on the spot with the other party they were better Judges of\nthe whole, and of what could, or could not be done, than any person at\nthis distance, and unacquainted with many of the circumstances of the\ncase, can possibly be."If a treaty, a contract, or a cession be good upon the whole, it is ill\npolicy to hazard the whole, by an experiment to get some trifle in it\naltered.The right way of proceeding in such case is to make sure of\nthe whole by ratifying it, and then instruct the minister to propose\na clause to be added to the Instrument to obtain the amendment or\nalteration wished for.This was the method Congress took with respect to\nthe Treaty of Commerce with France in 1778.Congress ratified the whole\nand proposed two new articles which were agreed to by France and added\nto the Treaty."There is according to newspaper account an article which admits french\nand Spanish vessels on the same terms as American vessels.But this\ndoes not make it a commercial Treaty.It is only one of the Items in the\npayment: and it has this advantage, that it joins Spain with France in\nmaking the cession and is an encouragement to commerce and new settlers."With respect to the purchase, admitting it to be 15 millions dollars,\nit is an advantageous purchase.The revenue alone purchased as an\nannuity or rent roll is worth more--at present I suppose the revenue\nwill pay five per cent for the purchase money."I know not if these observations will be of any use to you.I am in\na retired village and out of the way of hearing the talk of the great\nworld.But I see that the Feds, at least some of them, are changing\ntheir tone and now reprobating the acquisition of Louisiana; and the\nonly way they can take to lose the affair will be to take it up as they\nwould a Treaty of Commerce and annull it by a Minority; or entangle it\nwith some condition that will render the ratification of no effect."I believe in this state (Jersey) we shall have a majority at the next\nelection.I have half a\ndisposition to visit the Western World next spring and go on to New\nOrleans.They are a new people and unacquainted with the principles of\nrepresentative government and I think I could do some good among them."As the stage-boat which was to take this letter to the Post-office does\nnot depart till to-morrow, I amuse myself with continuing the subject\nafter I had intended to close it."I know little and can learn but little of the extent and present\npopulation of Louisiana.After the cession be com-pleated and the\nterritory annexed to the United States it will, I suppose, be formed\ninto states, one, at least, to begin with."The people, as I have said, are new to us and we to them and a great\ndeal will depend on a right beginning.As they have been transferred\nbackward and forward several times from one European Government to\nanother it is natural to conclude they have no fixed prejudices with\nrespect to foreign attachments, and this puts them in a fit disposition\nfor their new condition.The established religion is roman; but in\nwhat state it is as to exterior ceremonies (such as processions and\ncelebrations), I know not.Had the cession to france continued with her,\nreligion I suppose would have been put on the same footing as it is\nin that country, and there no ceremonial of religion can appear on the\nstreets or highways; and the same regulation is particularly necessary\nnow or there will soon be quarrels and tumults between the old settlers\nand the new.The Yankees will not move out of the road for a little\nwooden Jesus stuck on a stick and carried in procession nor kneel in\nthe dirt to a wooden Virgin Mary.As we do not govern the territory as\nprovinces but incorporated as states, religion there must be on the same\nfooting it is here, and Catholics have the same rights as Catholics have\nwith us and no others.As to political condition the Idea proper to be\nheld out is, that we have neither conquered them, nor bought them, but\nformed a Union with them and they become in consequence of that union a\npart of the national sovereignty."The present Inhabitants and their descendants will be a majority for\nsome time, but new emigrations from the old states and from Europe, and\nintermarriages, will soon change the first face of things, and it is\nnecessary to have this in mind when the first measures shall be taken.Everything done as an expedient grows worse every day, for in proportion\nas the mind grows up to the full standard of sight it disclaims the\nexpedient.America had nearly been ruined by expedients in the first\nstages of the revolution, and perhaps would have been so, had not\n\'Common Sense\' broken the charm and the Declaration of Independence sent\nit into banishment."Yours in friendship\n\n"Thomas Paine.*\n\n"remember me in the circle of your friends."William F.\n     Havermeyer, Jr.E. M. Woodward, in his account of Bordentown, mentions among the\n"traditions" of the place, that Paine used to meet a large number of\ngentlemen at the "Washington House," kept by Debora Applegate, where he\nconversed freely "with any proper person who approached him."Paine was too much occupied in literary pursuits and writing to\nspend a great deal of his time here, but he generally paid several\nvisits during the day.In walking he\nwas generally absorbed in deep thought, seldom noticed any one as he\npassed, unless spoken to, and in going from his home to the tavern was\nfrequently observed to cross the street several times.It is stated that\nseveral members of the church were turned from their faith by him, and\non this account, and the general feeling of the community against him\nfor his opinions on religious subjects, he was by the mass of the\npeople held in odium, which feeling to some extent was extended to Col.These "traditions" were recorded in 1876.Paine\'s "great power of\nconversation" was remembered.But among the traditions, even of the\nreligious, there is none of any excess in drinking.Possibly the turning of several church-members from their faith may\nnot have been so much due to Paine as to the parsons, in showing their\n"religion" as a gorgon turning hearts to stone against a benefactor\nof mankind.One day Paine went with Colonel Kirkbride to visit Samuel\nRogers, the Colonels brother-in-law, at Bellevue, across the river.As\nhe entered the door Rogers turned his back, refusing his old friend\'s\nhand, because it had written the "Age of Reason."Presently Borden-town\nwas placarded with pictures of the Devil flying away with Paine.The\npulpits set up a chorus of vituperation.Why should the victim spare the\naltar on which he is sacrificed, and justice also?Dogma had chosen to\ngrapple with the old man in its own way.That it was able to break a\ndriven leaf Paine could admit as truly as Job; but he could as bravely\nsay: Withdraw thy hand from me, and I will answer thee, or thou shalt\nanswer me!In Paine too it will be proved that such outrages on truth\nand friendship, on the rights of thought, proceed from no God, but from\nthe destructive forces once personified as the adversary of man.Early in March Paine visited New York, to see Monroe before his\ndeparture for France.He drove with Kirkbride to Trenton; but so furious\nwas the pious mob, he was refused a seat in the Trenton stage.They\ndined at Government House, but when starting for Brunswick were hooted\nThese were the people for whose liberties Paine had marched that same\nroad on foot, musket in hand.At Trenton insults were heaped on the\nman who by camp-fires had written the _Crisis_, which animated the\nconquerors of the Hessians at that place, in "the times that tried men\'s\nsouls."These people he helped to make free,--free to cry _Crucify!_\n\nPaine had just written to Jefferson that the Louisianians were "perhaps\ntoo much under the influence of their priests to be sufficiently free."Probably the same thought occurred to him about people nearer home,\nwhen he presently heard of Colonel Kirkbride\'s sudden unpopularity, and\ndeath.On October 3d Paine lost this faithful friend.*\n\n     * It should be stated that Burlington County, in which\n     Bordentown is situated, was preponderantly Federalist, and\n     that Trenton was in the hands of a Federalist mob of young\n     well-to-do rowdies.The editor of the _True American_, a\n     Republican paper to which Paine had contributed, having\n     commented on a Fourth of July orgie of those rowdies in a\n     house associated with the revolution, was set upon with\n     bludgeons on July 12th, and suffered serious injuries.The\n     Grand Jury refused to present the Federalist ruffians,\n     though the evidence was clear, and the mob had free course.The facts of the Paine mob are these: after dining at Government House,\nTrenton, Kirkbride applied for a seat on the New York stage for Paine.The owner, Voorhis, cursed Paine as "a deist," and said, "I \'ll be\ndamned if he shall go in my stage."Another stage-owner also refused,\nsaying, "My stage and horses were once struck by lightning, and I don\'t\nwant them to suffer again."When Paine and Kirkbride had entered their\ncarriage a mob surrounded them with a drum, playing the "rogue\'s march."The local reporter (_True American_) says, "Mr.Paine discovered not the\nleast emotion of fear or anger, but calmly observed that such conduct\nhad no tendency to hurt his feelings or injure his fame."The mob then\ntried to frighten the horse with the drum, and succeeded, but the two\ngentlemen reached a friend\'s house in Brunswick in safety.A letter\nfrom Trenton had been written to the stage-master there also, to prevent\nPaine from securing a seat, whether with success does not appear.NEW ROCHELLE AND THE BONNEVILLES\n\nThe Bonnevilles, with whom Paine had resided in Paris, were completely\nimpoverished after his departure.They resolved to follow Paine to\nAmerica, depending on his promise of aid should they do so.Foreseeing\nperils in France, Nicolas, unable himself to leave at once, hurried off\nhis wife and children--Benjamin, Thomas, and Louis.Madame Bonneville\nwould appear to have arrived in August, 1803.I infer this because Paine\nwrites, September 23d, to Jefferson from Stonington, Connecticut; and\nlater letters show that he had been in New York, and afterwards placed\nThomas Paine Bonneville with the Rev.Foster (Universalist) of\nStonington for education.Madame Bonneville was placed in his house at\nBordentown, where she was to teach French.At New York, Paine found both religious and political parties sharply\ndivided over him.At Lovett\'s Hotel, where he stopped, a large dinner\nwas given him, March 18th, seventy being present One of the active\npromoters of this dinner was James Cheetham, editor of the _American\nCitizen_, who, after seriously injuring Paine by his patronage, became\nhis malignant enemy.In the summer of 1803 the political atmosphere was in a tempestuous\ncondition, owing to the widespread accusation that Aaron Burr had\nintrigued with the Federalists against Jefferson to gain the presidency.There was a Society in New York called "Republican Greens," who, on\nIndependence Day, had for a toast "Thomas Paine, the Man of the People,"\nand who seem to have had a piece of music called the "Rights of Man."Paine was also apparently the hero of that day at White Plains, where\na vast crowd assembled, "over 1,000," among the toasts being: "Thomas\nPaine--the bold advocate of rational liberty--the People\'s friend."He\nprobably reached New York again in August A letter for "Thomas Payne"\nis in the advertised Letter-list of August 6th, and in the _American\nCitizen_ (August 9th) are printed (and misprinted) "Lines, extempore, by\nThomas Paine, July, 1803."*\n\n     * On July 12th the _Evening Post _(edited by William\n     Coleman) tries to unite republicanism and infidelity by\n     stating that Part I. of the "Age of Reason" was sent in MS.Fellows of New York, and in the following year Part\n     II.was gratuitously distributed "from what is now the\n     office of the Aurora."On September 24th that paper\n     publishes a poem about Paine, ending:\n\n\n     "Quick as the lightning\'s vivid flash\n     The poet\'s eye o\'er Europe rolls;\n     Sees battles rage, hears tempests crash,\n     And dims at horror\'s threatening scowls."Mark ambition\'s ruthless king,\n     With crimsoned banners scathe the globe;\n     While trailing after conquest\'s wing,\n     Man\'s festering wounds his demons probe."Palled with streams of reeking gore\n     That stain the proud imperial day,\n     He turns to view the western shore,\n     Where freedom holds her boundless sway."\'T is here her sage triumphant sways\n     An empire in the people\'s love;\n     \'T is here the sovereign will obeys\n     No king but Him who rules above."The verses, crudely expressing the contrast between President Jefferson\nand King George--or Napoleon, it is not clear which,--sufficiently show\nthat Paine\'s genius was not extempore.His reputation as a patriotic\nminstrel was high; his "Hail, great Republic," to the tune of "Rule\nBritannia," was the established Fourth-of-July song, and it was even\nsung at the dinner of the American consul in London (Erving) March 4,\n1803, the anniversary of Jefferson\'s election.Possibly the extempore\nlines were sung on some Fourth-of-July occasion.I find "Thomas Paine"\nand the "Rights of Man" favorite toasts at republican celebrations in\nVirginia also at this time.In New York we may discover Paine\'s coming\nand going by rancorous paragraphs concerning him in the _Evening Post_.*\n\n     "And having spent a lengthy life in evil,\n     Return again unto thy parent Devil!"Perhaps the most malignant wrong done Paine in this paper was the\nadoption of his signature, "Common Sense," by one of its contributors!Another paragraph says that Franklin hired Paine in London to come to\nAmerica and write in favor of the Revolution,--a remarkable example of\nfederalist heredity from "Toryism."On September 27th the paper prints a\nletter purporting to have been found by a waiter in Lovett\'s Hotel after\nPaine\'s departure,--a long letter to Paine, by some red-revolutionary\nfriend, of course gloating over the exquisite horrors filling Europe in\nconsequence of the "Rights of Man."12, 1803," and signed "J.The paper\'s correspondent pretends\nto have found out Oldney, and conversed with him.No doubt many simple\npeople believed the whole thing genuine.The most learned physician in New York, Dr.Nicholas Romayne, invited\nPaine to dinner, where he was met by John Pintard, and other eminent\ncitizens.Pintard said to Paine: "I have read and re-read your \'Age\nof Reason,\' and any doubts which I before entertained of the truth\nof revelation have been removed by your logic.Yes, sir, your very\narguments against Christianity have convinced me of its truth.""Well\nthen," answered Paine, "I may return to my couch to-night with the\nconsolation that I have made at least one Christian."* This authentic\nanecdote is significant John Pintard, thus outdone by Paine in\npoliteness, founded the Tammany Society, and organized the democratic\nparty.When the "Rights of Man" appeared, the book and its author were\nthe main toasts of the Tammany celebrations; but it was not so after\nthe "Age of Reason" had appeared.For John Pintard was all his life\na devotee of Dutch Reformed orthodoxy.Tammany, having begun with the\npopulace, had by this time got up somewhat in society.As a rule the\n"gentry" were Federalists, though they kept a mob in their back yard to\nfly at the democrats on occasion.But with Jefferson in the presidential\nchair, and Clinton vice-president, Tammany was in power.To hold this\npower Tammany had to court the clergy.So there was no toast to Paine in\nthe Wigwam of 1803.Francis\' "Old New York," p.** The New York Daily Advertiser published the whole of Part\n     I. of the "Rights of Man" in 1791 (May 6-27), the editor\n     being then John Pintard.At the end of the publication a\n     poetical tribute to Paine was printed.Four of the lines run:\n\n     "Rous\'d by the reason of his manly page,\n     Once more shall Paine a listening world engage;\n     From reason\'s source a bold reform he brings,\n     By raising up mankind he pulls down kings."President Jefferson was very anxious about the constitutional points\ninvolved in his purchase of Louisiana, and solicited Paine\'s views on\nthe whole subject.Paine wrote to him extended communications, among\nwhich was the letter of September 23d, from Stonington.The interest of\nthe subject is now hardly sufficient to warrant publication of the whole\nof this letter, which, however, possesses much interest.At the great celebration (October 12, 1792) of the third Centenary of\nthe discovery of America, by the sons of St Tammany, New York, the first\nman toasted after Columbus was Paine, and next to Paine "The Rights of\nMan."They were also extolled in an ode composed for the occasion, and\nsung."Your two favours of the 10 and 18 ult.reached me at this place on the\n14th inst.I do not suppose that the framers\nof the Constitution thought anything about the acquisition of new\nterritory, and even if they did it was prudent to say nothing about\nit, as it might have suggested to foreign Nations the idea that we\ncontemplated foreign conquest.It appears to me to be one of those cases\nwith which the Constitution had nothing to do, and which can be judged\nof only by the circumstances of the times when such a case shall occur.The Constitution could not foresee that Spain would cede Louisiana to\nFrance or to England, and therefore it could not determine what our\nconduct should be in consequence of such an event.The cession makes\nno alteration in the Constitution; it only extends the principles of it\nover a larger territory, and this certainly is within the morality of\nthe Constitution, and not contrary to, nor beyond, the expression or\nintention of any of its articles... Were a question to arise it would\napply, not to the Cession, because it violates no article of the\nConstitution, but to Ross and Morris\'s motion.The Constitution empowers\nCongress to declare war, but to make war without declaring it is\nanti-constitutional.It is like attacking an unarmed man in the dark.There is also another reason why no such question should arise.The\nenglish Government is but in a tottering condition and if Bonaparte\nsucceeds, that Government will break up.In that case it is not\nimprobable we may obtain Canada, and I think that Bermuda ought to\nbelong to the United States.In its present condition it is a nest for\npiratical privateers.This is not a subject to be spoken of, but it may\nbe proper to have it in mind."The latest news we have from Europe in this place is the insurrection\nin Dublin.It is a disheartening circumstance to the english Government,\nas they are now putting arms into the hands of people who but a few\nweeks before they would have hung had they found a pike in their\npossession.I think the probability is in favour of the descent [on\nEngland by Bonaparte]...\n\n"I shall be employed the ensuing Winter in cutting two or three thousand\nCords of Wood on my farm at New Rochelle for the New York market distant\ntwenty miles by water.The Wood is worth 3 1/2 dollars per load as it\nstands.This will furnish me with ready money, and I shall then be ready\nfor whatever may present itself of most importance next spring.I had\nintended to build myself a house to my own taste, and a workshop for\nmy mechanical operations, and make a collection, as authors say, of\nmy works, which with what I have in manuscript will make four, or five\noctavo volumes, and publish them by subscription, but the prospects that\nare now opening with respect to England hold me in suspence."It has been customary in a President\'s discourse to say something about\nreligion.The word, religion,\nused as a word _en masse_ has no application to a country like America.In catholic countries it would mean exclusively the religion of the\nromish church; with the Jews, the Jewish religion; in England,\nthe protestant religion or in the sense of the english church, the\nestablished religion; with the Deists it would mean Deism; with the\nTurks, Mahometism &c, &c, As well as I recollect it is _Lego, Religo,\nRelegio, Religion_, that is say, tied or bound by an oath or obligation.The french use the word properly; when a woman enters a convent, she is\ncalled a novitiate; when she takes the oath, she is a _religieuse_, that\nis, she is bound by an oath.Now all that we have to do, as a Government\nwith the word religion, in this country, is with the civil rights of it,\nand not at all with its _creeds_.Instead therefore of using the word\nreligion, as a word en masse, as if it meant a creed, it would be better\nto speak only of its civil rights; _that all denominations of religion\nare equally protected, that none are dominant, none inferior, that\nthe rights of conscience are equal to every denomination and to every\nindividual and that it is the duty of Government to preserve this\nequality of conscientious rights_.A man cannot be called a hypocrite\nfor defending the civil rights of religion, but he may be suspected of\ninsincerity in defending its creeds."I suppose you will find it proper to take notice of the impressment of\nAmerican seamen by the Captains of British vessels, and procure a list\nof such captains and report them to their government.This pretence\nof searching for british seamen is a new pretence for visiting and\nsearching American vessels....\n\n"I am passing some time at this place at the house of a friend till the\nwood cutting time comes on, and I shall engage some cutters here and\nthen return to New Rochelle.Madison concerning the\nreport that the british Government had cautioned ours not to pay\nthe purchase money for Louisiana, as they intended to take it for\nthemselves.I have received his [negative] answer, and I pray you make\nhim my compliments."We are still afflicted with the yellow fever, and the Doctors are\ndisputing whether it is an imported or a domestic disease.Would it not\nbe a good measure to prohibit the arrival of all vessels from the West\nIndies from the last of June to the middle of October.If this was\ndone this session of Congress, and we escaped the fever next summer, we\nshould always know how to escape it.I question if performing quarantine\nis a sufficient guard.The disease may be in the cargo, especially that\npart which is barrelled up, and not in the persons on board, and when\nthat cargo is opened on our wharfs, the hot steaming air in contact with\nthe ground imbibes the infection.I can conceive that infected air can\nbe barrelled up, not in a hogshead of rum, nor perhaps sucre, but in\na barrel of coffee.I am badly off in this place for pen and Ink, and\nshort of paper.I heard yesterday from Boston that our old friend S.\nAdams was at the point of death.When Madame Bonneville left France it was understood that her husband\nwould soon follow, but he did not come, nor was any letter received from\nhim.This was probably the most important allusion in a letter of Paine,\ndated New York, March 1, 1804, to "Citizen Skipwith, Agent Commercial\nd\'Amerique, Paris.""Dear Friend--I have just a moment to write you a line by a friend who\nis on the point of sailing for Bordeaux.The Republican interest is now\ncompleatly triumphant.The change within this last year has been great.We have now 14 States out of 17,--N. Hampshire, Mass.I much question if any person will be started against Mr.Burr is rejected for the vice-presidency; he is now putting\nup for Governor of N. York.Morgan Lewis, Chief Justice of the State of N. Y. is the Republican\ncandidate for Governor of that State."I have not received a line from Paris, except a letter from Este, since\nI left it.We have now been nearly 80 days without news from Europe.I have not heard anything from him except that\nhe is _always_ coming.Not a line has been\nreceived from aim.Madame Bonneville, unable to speak English, found Bordentown dull,\nand soon turned up in New York.She ordered rooms in Wilburn\'s\nboarding-house, where Paine was lodging, and the author found the\nsituation rather complicated The family was absolutely without means\nof their own, and Paine, who had given them a comfortable home at\nBordentown, was annoyed by their coming on to New York.Anxiety is shown\nin the following letter written at 16 Gold St., New York, March 24th, to\n"Mr."Dear Sir,--I received your letter by Mr.Nixon, and also a former\nletter, but I have been so unwell this winter with a fit of gout, tho\'\nnot so bad as I had at Bordenton about twenty years ago, that I could\nnot write, and after I got better I got a fall on the ice in the garden\nwhere I lodge that threw me back for above a month.I was obliged to get\na person to copy off the letter to the people of England, published\nin the Aurora, March 7, as I dictated it verbally, for all the time my\ncomplaint continued.My health and spirits were as good as ever.It\nwas my intention to have cut a large quantity of wood for the New York\nmarket, and in that case you would have had the money directly, but this\naccident and the gout prevented my doing anything.I shall now have to\ntake up some money upon it, which I shall do by the first of May to put\nMrs.Bonneville into business, and I shall then discharge her bill.In\nthe mean time I wish you to receive a quarter\'s rent due on the 1st of\nApril from Mrs Richardson, at $25 per ann., and to call on Mrs.Read for\n40 or 50 dollars, or what you can get, and to give a receipt in my name.Kirkbride should have discharged your bill, it was what he engaged\nto do.Wharton owes for the rent of the house while she lived in\nit, unless Col.Kirkbride has taken it into his accounts.Samuel Hileyar\nowes me 84 dollars lent him in hard money.Nixon spake to me about\nhiring my house, but as I did not know if Mrs.Richardson intended to\nstay in it or quit it I could give no positive answer, but said I would\nwrite to you about it.Israel Butler also writes me about taking at the\nsame rent as Richardson pays.I will be obliged to you to let the house\nas you may judge best.I shall make a visit to Bordenton in the spring,\nand I shall call at your house first."There have been several arrivals here in short passages from England.P. Porcupine, I see, is become the panegyrist of Bonaparte.You will see\nit in the Aurora of March 19, and also the message of Bonaparte to the\nfrench legislature.She would have wrote, but she\ncannot yet venture to write in English.I congratulate you on your new\nappointment."*\n\n     * I am indebted for this letter to the N. Y. Hist.Society,\n     which owns the original ought to be fulfilled."The\n     following passages may be quoted:\n\n     "In casting my eye over England and America, and comparing\n     them together, the difference is very striking.The two\n     countries were created by the same power, and peopled from\n     the same stock.Have\n     those who emigrated to America improved, or those whom they\n     left behind degenerated?...We see America flourishing\n     in peace, cultivating friendship with all nations, and\n     reducing her public debt and taxes, incurred by the\n     revolution.On the contrary we see England almost\n     perpetually in war, or warlike disputes, and her debt and\n     taxes continually increasing.Could we suppose a stranger,\n     who knew nothing of the origin of the two nations, he would\n     from observation conclude that America was the old country,\n     experienced and sage, and England the new, eccentric and\n     wild.Scarcely had England drawn home her troops from\n     America, after the revolutionary war, than she was on the\n     point of plunging herself into a war with Holland, on\n     account of the Stadtholder; then with Russia; then with\n     Spain on account of the Nootka cat-skins; and actually with\n     France to prevent her revolution.Scarcely had she made\n     peace with France, and before she had fulfilled her own part\n     of the Treaty, than she declared war again, to avoid\n     fulfilling the Treaty.In her Treaty of peace with America,\n     she engaged to evacuate the western posts within six months;\n     but, having obtained peace, she refused to fulfil the\n     conditions, and kept possession of the posts, and embroiled\n     herself in an Indian war.* In her Treaty of peace with\n     France, she engaged to evacuate Malta within three months;\n     but, having obtained peace, she refused to evacuate Malta,\n     and began a new war."* Paine\'s case is not quite sound at this point.The\n     Americans had not, on their side, fulfilled the condition of\n     paying their English debts.(1804)\n\nPaine\'s letter alluded to was printed in the _Aurora_ with the following\nnote:\n\n"To the Editor.--As the good sense of the people in their elections has\nnow put the affairs of America in a prosperous condition at home and\nabroad, there is nothing immediately important for the subject of a\nletter.I therefore send you a piece on another subject."The piece presently appeared as a pamphlet of sixteen pages with the\nfollowing title: "Thomas Paine to the People of England, on the Invasion\nof England.Philadelphia: Printed at the Temple of Reason Press, Arch\nStreet.Once more the hope had risen in Paine\'s breast that\nNapoleon was to turn liberator, and that England was to be set free."If\nthe invasion succeed I hope Bonaparte will remember that this war\nhas not been provoked by the people.It is altogether the act of the\ngovernment without their consent or knowledge; and though the late\npeace appears to have been insidious from the first, on the part of the\ngovernment, it was received by the people with a sincerity of joy."He still hopes that the English people may be able to end the trouble\npeacefully, by compelling Parliament to fulfil the Treaty of Amiens.Paine points out that the failure of the French Revolution was due to\n"the provocative interference of foreign powers, of which Pitt was\nthe principal and vindictive agent," and affirms the success of\nrepresentative government in the United States after thirty years\'\ntrial."The people of England have now two revolutions before them,--the\none as an example, the other as a warning.Their own wisdom will direct\nthem what to choose and what to avoid; and in everything which regards\ntheir happiness, combined with the common good of mankind, I wish them\nhonor and success."During this summer, Paine wrote a brilliant paper on a memorial sent\nto Congress from the French inhabitants of Louisiana.They demanded\nimmediate admission to equal Statehood, also the right to continue\nthe importation of <DW64> slaves.Paine reminds the memorialists of\nthe "mischief caused in France by the possession of power before they\nunderstood principles."After explaining their position, and the\nfreedom they have acquired by the merits of others, he points out their\nignorance of human "rights" as shown in their guilty notion that to\nenslave others is among them."Dare you put up a petition to Heaven\nfor such a power, without fearing to be struck from the earth by its\njustice?Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?Do you want to\nrenew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?"This article (dated September 22d) produced great effect.John Randolph\nof Roanoke, in a letter to Albert Gallatin (October 14th), advises\n"the printing of... thousand copies of Tom Paine\'s answer to their\nremonstrance, and transmitting them by as many thousand troops, who\ncan speak a language perfectly intelligible to the people of Louisiana,\nwhatever that of their governor may be."Nicolas Bonneville still giving no sign, and Madame being uneconomical\nin her notions of money, Paine thought it necessary--morally and\nfinancially--to let it be known that he was not responsible for her\ndebts.When, therefore, Wilburn applied to him for her board ($35),\nPaine declined to pay, and was sued.Paine pleaded _non assumpsit_, and,\nafter gaining the case, paid Wilburn the money.It presently turned out that the surveillance of Nicolas Bonneville did\nnot permit him to leave France, and, as he was not permitted to resume\nhis journal or publications, he could neither join his family nor assist\nthem.Paine now resolved to reside on his farm.It is dated at New Rochelle, July 9th:\n\n"Fellow Citizen,--As the weather is now getting hot at New York, and the\npeople begin to get out of town, you may as well come up here and help\nme settle my accounts with the man who lives on the place.You will be\nable to do this better than I shall, and in the mean time I can go on\nwith my literary works, without having my mind taken off by affairs of\na different kind.I have received a packet from Governor Clinton,\nenclosing what I wrote for.If you come up by the stage you will stop\nat the post-office, and they will direct you the way to the farm.I send a price for the Prospect; if the plan\nmentioned in it is pursued, it will open a way to enlarge and give\nestablishment to the deistical church; but of this and some other things\nwe will talk when you come up, and the sooner the better.Paine was presently enjoying himself on his farm at New Rochelle, and\nMadame Bonneville began to keep house for him."It is a pleasant and healthy situation [he wrote to Jefferson somewhat\nlater], commanding a prospect always green and peaceable, as New\nRochelle produces a great deal of grass and hay.The farm contains three\nhundred acres, about one hundred of which is meadow land, one hundred\ngrazing and village land, and the remainder woodland.It is an oblong\nabout a mile and a half in length.I have sold off sixty-one acres and\na half for four thousand and twenty dollars.With this money I shall\nimprove the other part, and build an addition 34 feet by 32 to the\npresent dwelling."He goes on into an architectural description, with drawings, of\nthe arched roof he intends to build, the present form of roof being\n"unpleasing to the eye."He also draws an oak floor such as they make in\nParis, which he means to imitate.With a black cook, Rachel Gidney, the family seemed to be getting on\nwith fair comfort; but on Christmas Eve an event occurred which came\nnear bringing Paine\'s plans to an abrupt conclusion.This is related\nin a letter to William Carver, New York, dated January 16th, at New\nRochelle."Esteemed Friend,--I have recd, two letters from you, one giving an\naccount of your taking Thomas to Mr.Foster*--the other dated Jany.12--I did not answer the first because I hoped to see you the next\nSaturday or the Saturday after.* Thomas Bonneville, Paine\'s godson, at school in Stonington.What you heard of a gun being fired into the room is true--Robert and\nRachel were both gone out to keep Christmas Eve and about eight o\'clock\nat Night the gun were fired.Dean\'s\nboys with me, but the person that had done it was gone.I directly\nsuspected who it was, and I halloed to him by name, that _he was\ndiscovered_.I did this that the party who fired might know I was on the\nwatch.I cannot find any ball, but whatever the gun was charged with\npassed through about three or four inches below the window making a hole\nlarge enough to a finger to go through--the muzzle must have been very\nnear as the place is black with the powder, and the glass of the window\nis shattered to pieces.Mr Shute after examining the place and getting\nwhat information could be had, issued a warrant to take up Derrick, and\nafter examination committed him."He is now on bail (five hundred dollars) to take his trial at the\nsupreme Court in May next.Derrick owes me forty-eight dollars for which\nI have his note, and he was to work it out in making stone fence which\nhe has not even begun and besides this I have had to pay forty-two\npounds eleven shillings for which I had passed my word for him at Mr.Derrick borrowed the Gun under pretence of giving Mrs.He was with Purdy about two hours before the\nattack on the house was made and he came from thence to Dean\'s half\ndrunk and brought with him a bottle of Rum, and Purdy was with him when\nhe was taken up."I am exceedingly well in health and shall always be glad to see you.Hubbs tells me that your horse is getting better.Shute sent for\nthe horse and took him when the first snow came but he leaped the fences\nand came back.If this be the case I\nsuppose he has broke or cracked it in leaping a fence when he was lame\non the other hind leg, and hung with his hind legs in the fence.I am\nglad to hear what you tell me of Thomas.He shall not want for anything\nthat is necessary if he be a good boy for he has no friend but me.You\nhave not given me any account about the meeting house.The window of the room said to have been Paine\'s study is close to the\nground, and it is marvellous that he was not murdered.**\n\n     * I am indebted for this letter to Dr.Clair J. Grece, of\n     England, whose uncle, Daniel Constable, probably got it from\n     Carver.** Derrick (or Dederick) appears by the records at White\n     Plains to have been brought up for trial May 19, 1806, and\n     to have been recognized in the sum of $500 for his\n     appearance at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer and\n     General Gaol Delivery, and in the meantime to keep the peace\n     towards the\n\nPeople, and especially towards Thomas Payne (sic).Paine, Christopher\nHubbs, and Andrew A. Dean were recognized in $50 to appear and give\nevidence against Derrick.Nothing further appears in the records\n(examined for me by Mr.B. D. Washburn up to 1810).It is pretty certain\nthat Paine did not press the charges.The most momentous change which had come over America during Paine\'s\nabsence was the pro-slavery reaction.This had set in with the first\nCongress.An effort was made by the Virginia representatives to check\nthe slave traffic by imposing a duty of $10 on each <DW64> imported, but\nwas defeated by an alliance of members from more Southern States and\nprofessedly antislavery men of the North.The Southern leader in this\nfirst victory of slavery in Congress was Major Jackson of Georgia, who\ndefended the institution as scriptural and civilizing.Franklin published (Federal Gazette, March 25, 1790) a parody of\nJackson\'s speech, purporting to be a speech uttered in 1687 by a Divan\nof Algiers in defence of piracy and slavery, against a sect of Erika,\nor Purists, who had petitioned for their suppression.Franklin was now\npresident of the American Antislavery Society, founded in Philadelphia\nin 1775 five weeks after the appearance of Paine\'s scheme of\nemancipation (March 8, 1775).Rush was also active in the cause, and\nto him Paine wrote (March 16, 1790) the letter on the subject elsewhere\nquoted (L, p.This letter was published by Rush (Columbian\nMagazine, vol.318) while the country was still agitated by the\ndebate which was going on in Congress at the time when it was written,\non a petition of the Antislavery Society, signed by Franklin,--his\nlast public act.Franklin died April 17, 1790, twenty-five days after the close of the\ndebate, in which he was bitterly denounced by the proslavery party.Washington had pronounced the petition "inopportune,"--his presidential\nmansion in New York was a few steps from the slave-market,--Jefferson\n(now Secretary of State) had no word to say for it, Madison had smoothed\nover the matter by a compromise.Thenceforth slavery had become a\nsuppressed subject, and the slave trade, whenever broached in Congress,\nhad maintained its immunity.In 1803, even under Jefferson\'s\nadministration, the <DW64>s fleeing from oppression in Domingo were\nforbidden asylum in America, because it was feared that they would\nincite servile insurrections.That the United States, under presidency\nof Jefferson, should stand aloof from the struggle of the <DW64>s in\nDomingo for liberty, cut Paine to the heart.Unperturbed by the attempt\nmade on his own life a few days before, he wrote to Jefferson on New\nYear\'s Day, 1805, (from New Rochelle,) what may be regarded as an\nappeal:\n\n\n\n\n{1805}\n\n"Dear Sir,--I have some thoughts of coming to Washington this winter, as\nI may as well spend a part of it there as elsewhere.But lest bad roads\nor any other circumstance should prevent me I suggest a thought for\nyour consideration, and I shall be glad if in this case, as in that of\nLouisiana, we may happen to think alike without knowing what each other\nhad thought of."The affair of Domingo will cause some trouble in either of the cases\nin which it now stands.If armed merchantmen force their way through the\nblockading fleet it will embarrass us with the french Government;\nand, on the other hand, if the people of Domingo think that we show a\npartiality to the french injurious to them there is danger they will\nturn Pirates upon us, and become more injurious on account of vicinity\nthan the barbary powers, and England will encourage it, as she\nencourages the Indians.Domingo is lost to France either as to the\nGovernment or the possession of it, But if a way could be found out to\nbring about a peace between france and Domingo through the mediation,\nand under the guarantee of the United States, it would be beneficial to\nall parties, and give us a great commercial and political standing,\nnot only with the present people of Domingo but with the West Indies\ngenerally.And when we have gained their confidence by acts of\njustice and friendship, they will listen to our advice in matters of\nCivilization and Government, and prevent the danger of their becoming\npirates, which I think they will be, if driven to desperation."The United States is the only power that can undertake a measure of\nthis kind.She is now the Parent of the Western world, and her knowledge\nof the local circumstances of it gives her an advantage in a matter of\nthis kind superior to any European Nation.She is enabled by situation,\nand grow[ing] importance to become a guarantee, and to see, as far as\nher advice and influence can operate, that the conditions on the part\nof Domingo be fulfilled.It is also a measure that accords with\nthe humanity of her principles, with her policy, and her commercial\ninterest."All that Domingo wants of France, is, that France agree to let her\nalone, and withdraw her forces by sea and land; and in return for\nthis Domingo to give her a monopoly of her commerce for a term of\nyears,--that is, to import from France all the utensils and manufactures\nshe may have occasion to use or consume (except such as she can more\nconveniently procure from the manufactories of the United States), and\nto pay for them in produce.France will gain more by this than she can\nexpect to do even by a conquest of the Island, and the advantage to\nAmerica will be that she will become the carrier of both, at least\nduring the present war."There was considerable dislike in Paris against the Expedition to\nDomingo; and the events that have since taken place were then often\npredicted.The opinion that generally prevailed at that time was that\nthe commerce of the Island was better than the conquest of it,--that the\nconquest could not be accomplished without destroying the <DW64>s, and\nin that case the Island would be of no value."I think it might be signified to the french Government, yourself is\nthe best judge of the means, that the United States are disposed to\nundertake an accommodation so as to put an end to this otherwise endless\nslaughter on both sides, and to procure to France the best advantages in\npoint of commerce that the state of things will admit of.Such an offer,\nwhether accepted or not, cannot but be well received, and may lead to a\ngood end."There is now a fine snow, and if it continues I intend to set off\nfor Philadelphia in about eight days, and from thence to Washington.I congratulate your constituents on the success of the election for\nPresident and Vice-President."Yours in friendship,\n\n"Thomas Paine."The journey to Washington was given up, and Paine had to content himself\nwith his pen.He took in several newspapers, and was as keenly alive\nas ever to the movements of the world.His chief anxiety was lest some\nconcession might be made to the Louisianians about the slave trade, that\nregion being an emporium of the traffic which grew more enterprising and\nbrutal as its term was at hand.Much was said of the great need of the\nnewly acquired region for more laborers, and it was known that Jefferson\nwas by no means so severe in his opposition to slavery as he was once\nsupposed to be.The President repeatedly invited Paine\'s views, and they\nwere given fully and freely.The following extracts are from a letter\ndated New York, January 25, 1805:\n\n"Mr.Wingate called on me at N. York, where I\nhappened to be when they arrived on their Journey from Washington to\nthe Eastward: I find by Mr.Lincoln that the Louisiana Memorialists will\nhave to return as they came and the more decisively Congress put an\nend to this business the better.The Cession of Louisiana is a great\nacquisition; but great as it is it would be an incumbrance on the Union\nwere the prayer of the petitioners to be granted, nor would the lauds be\nworth settling if the settlers are to be under a french jurisdiction....\nWhen the emigrations from the United States into Louisiana become equal\nto the number of french inhabitants it may then be proper and right to\nerect such part where such equality exists into a constitutional state;\nbut to do it now would be sending the american settlers into exile....\nFor my own part, I wish the name of Louisiana to be lost, and this may\nin a great measure be done by giving names to the new states that will\nserve as descriptive of their situation or condition.France lost the\nnames and almost the remembrance of provinces by dividing them into\ndepartments with appropriate names."Next to the acquisition of the territory and the Government of it\nis that of settling it.The people of the Eastern States are the\nbest settlers of a new country, and of people from abroad the German\nPeasantry are the best.The Irish in general are generous and dissolute.The Scotch turn their attention to traffic, and the English to\nmanufactures.These people are more fitted to live in cities than to\nbe cultivators of new lands.I know not if in Virginia they are much\nacquainted with the importation of German redemptioners, that is,\nservants indented for a term of years.The best farmers in Pennsylvania\nare those who came over in this manner or the descendants of them.The\nprice before the war used to be twenty pounds Pennsylvania currency for\nan indented servant for four years, that is, the ship owner, got twenty\npounds per head passage money, so that upon two hundred persons he would\nreceive after their arrival four thousand pounds paid by the persons who\npurchased the time of their indentures which was generally four\nyears.These would be the best people, of foreigners, to bring into\nLouisiana--because they would grow to be citizens.Whereas bringing poor\n<DW64>s to work the lands in a state of slavery and wretchedness, is,\nbesides the immorality of it, the certain way of preventing population\nand consequently of preventing revenue.I question if the revenue\narising from ten <DW64>s in the consumption of imported articles is\nequal to that of one white citizen.In the articles of dress and of the\ntable it is almost impossible to make a comparison."These matters though they do not belong to the class of principles are\nproper subjects for the consideration of Government; and it is always\nfortunate when the interests of Government and that of humanity act\nunitedly.But I much doubt if the Germans would come to be under a\nfrench Jurisdiction.Congress must frame the laws under which they are\nto serve out their time; after which Congress might give them a few\nacres of land to begin with for themselves and they would soon be able\nto buy more.I am inclined to believe that by adopting this method the\nCountry will be more peopled in about twenty years from the present time\nthan it has been in all the times of the french and Spaniards.Spain,\nI believe, held it chiefly as a barrier to her dominions in Mexico, and\nthe less it was improved the better it agreed with that policy; and\nas to france she never shewed any great disposition or gave any great\nencouragement to colonizing.It is chiefly small countries, that are\nstraitened for room at home, like Holland and England, that go in quest\nof foreign settlements....\n\n"I have again seen and talked with the gentleman from Hamburg.He tells\nme that some Vessels under pretence of shipping persons to America\ncarried them to England to serve as soldiers and sailors.He tells me\nhe has the Edict or Proclamation of the Senate of Hamburg forbidding\npersons shipping themselves without the consent of the Senate, and that\nhe will give me a copy of it, which if he does soon enough I will send\nwith this letter.He says that the American Consul has been spoken to\nrespecting this kidnapping business under American pretences, but\nthat he says he has no authority to interfere.The German members of\nCongress, or the Philadelphia merchants or ship-owners who have been\nin the practice of importing German redemptioners, can give you better\ninformation respecting the business of importation than I can.But the\nredemptioners thus imported must be at the charge of the Captain or\nship owner till their time is sold.Some of the quaker Merchants of\nPhiladelphia went a great deal into the importation of German servants\nor redemptioners.It agreed with the morality of their principles that\nof bettering people\'s condition, and to put an end to the practice of\nimporting slaves.I think it not an unreasonable estimation to suppose\nthat the population of Louisiana may be increased ten thousand souls\nevery year.What <DW44>s the settlement of it is the want of labourers,\nand until labourers can be had the sale of the lands will be slow.Were\nI twenty years younger, and my name and reputation as well known in\nEuropean countries as it is now, I would contract for a quantity of land\nin Louisiana and go to Europe and bring over settlers....\n\n"It is probable that towards the close of the session I may make an\nexcursion to Washington.The piece on Gouverneur Morris\'s Oration\non Hamilton and that on the Louisiana Memorial are the last I have\npublished; and as every thing of public affairs is now on a good ground\nI shall do as I did after the War, remain a quiet spectator and attend\nnow to my own affairs."I intend making a collection of all the pieces I have published,\nbeginning with Common Sense, and of what I have by me in manuscript,\nand publish them by subscription.I have deferred doing this till the\npresidential election should be over, but I believe there was not much\noccasion for that caution.There is more hypocrisy than bigotry in\nAmerica.When I was in Connecticut the summer before last, I fell\nin company with some Baptists among whom were three Ministers.The\nconversation turned on the election for President, and one of them who\nappeared to be a leading man said \'They cry out against Mr.Jefferson\nbecause, they say he is a Deist.Well, a Deist may be a good man, and if\nhe think it right, it is right to him.For my own part, said he, \'I had\nrather vote for a Deist than for a blue-skin presbyterian.\'\'You judge\nright,\' said I, \'for a man that is not of any of the sectaries will hold\nthe balance even between all; but give power to a bigot of any sectary\nand he will use it to the oppression of the rest, as the blue-skins\ndo in connection,\' They all agree in this sentiment, and I have always\nfound it assented to in any company I have had occasion to use it."I judge the collection I speak of will make five volumes octavo of four\nhundred pages each at two dollars a volume to be paid on delivery; and\nas they will be delivered separately, as fast as they can be printed and\nbound the subscribers may stop when they please.The three first volumes\nwill be political and each piece will be accompanied with an account\nof the state of affairs at the time it was written, whether in America,\nfrance, or England, which will also shew the occasion of writing it.of the Crisis published the 19th\nDecember \'76 is \'_These are the times that try men\'s souls,_\' It is\ntherefore necessary as explanatory to the expression in all future times\nto shew what those times were.The two last volumes will be theological\nand those who do not chuse to take them may let them alone.They will\nhave the right to do so, by the conditions of the subscription.I shall\nalso make a miscellaneous Volume of correspondence, Essays, and\nsome pieces of Poetry, which I believe will have some claim to\noriginality....\n\n"I find by the Captain [from New Orleans] above mentioned that several\nLiverpool ships have been at New Orleans.It is chiefly the people\nof Liverpool that employ themselves in the slave trade and they bring\ncargoes of those unfortunate <DW64>s to take back in return the hard\nmoney and the produce of the country.Had I the command of the elements\nI would blast Liverpool with fire and brimstone.It is the Sodom and\nGomorrah of brutality....\n\n"I recollect when in France that you spoke of a plan of making the\n<DW64>s tenants on a plantation, that is, allotting each Negroe family\na quantity of land for which they were to pay to the owner a certain\nquantity of produce.I think that numbers of our free <DW64>s might be\nprovided for in this manner in Louisiana.The best way that occurs to me\nis for Congress to give them their passage to New Orleans, then for them\nto hire themselves out to the planters for one or two years; they would\nby this means learn plantation business, after which to place them on a\ntract of land as before mentioned.A great many good things may now be\ndone; and I please myself with the idea of suggesting my thoughts to\nyou."Old Captain Landais who lives at Brooklyn on Long Island opposite\nNew York calls sometimes to see me.He is a very\nrespectable old man.I wish something had been done for him in Congress\non his petition; for I think something is due to him, nor do I see how\nthe Statute of limitation can consistently apply to him.The law in John\nAdams\'s administration, which cut off all commerce and communication\nwith france, cut him off from the chance of coming to America to put\nin his claim.I suppose that the claims of some of our merchants on\nEngland, france and Spain is more than 6 or 7 years standing yet no\nlaw of limitation, that I know of take place between nations or between\nindividuals of different nations.I consider a statute of limitation to\nbe a domestic law, and can only have a domestic operation.Miller,\none of the New York Senators in Congress, knows Landais and can give you\nan account of him."Concerning my former letter, on Domingo, I intended had I come to\nWashington to have talked with Pichon about it--if you had approved that\nmethod, for it can only be brought forward in an indirect way.The two\nEmperors are at too great a distance in objects and in colour to have\nany intercourse but by Fire and Sword, yet something I think might be\ndone.It is time I should close this long epistle.Paine made but a brief stay in New York (where he boarded with William\nCarver).His next letter (April 22d) is from New Rochelle, written to\nJohn Fellows, an auctioneer in New York City, one of his most faithful\nfriends."Citizen: I send this by the N. Rochelle boat and have desired the\nboatman to call on you with it.He is to bring up Bebia and Thomas and I\nwill be obliged to you to see them safe on board.The boat will leave N.\nY. on friday."I have left my pen knife at Carver\'s.It is, I believe, in the writing\ndesk.It is a small french pen knife that slides into the handle.I wish\nCarver would look behind the chest in the bed room.I miss some papers\nthat I suppose are fallen down there.The boys will bring up with them\none pair of the blankets Mrs.Bonneville took down and also my best\nblanket which is at Carver\'s.--I send enclosed three dollars for a ream\nof writing paper and one dollar for some letter paper, and porterage to\nthe boat.I wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with\nthem, and tell them that the better they behave the better it will be\nfor them.I am now their only dependance, and they ought to know it.of the Prospect, while I was at Carver\'s, are left there.since I came to New\nRochelle."\'The Thomas mentioned in this letter was Paine\'s godson, and "Bebia" was\nBenjamin,--the late Brigadier-General Bonneville, U. S. A. The third\nson, Louis, had been sent to his father in France.The _Prospect_ was\nElihu Palmer\'s rationalistic paper.Early in this year a series of charges affecting Jefferson\'s public and\nprivate character were published by one Hulbert, on the authority of\nThomas Turner of Virginia.Beginning with an old charge of cowardice,\nwhile Governor (of which Jefferson had been acquitted by the Legislature\nof Virginia), the accusation proceeded to instances of immorality,\npersons and places being named.The following letter from New Rochelle,\nJuly 19th, to John Fellows enclosed Paine\'s reply, which appeared in the\n_American Citizen_, July 23d and 24th:\n\n     * This letter is in the possession of Mr.Grenville Kane,\n     Tuxedo, N. Y."Citizen--I inclose you two pieces for Cheetham\'s paper, which I wish\nyou to give to him yourself.in one daily paper,\nand the other number in the next daily paper, and then both in his\ncountry paper.There has been a great deal of anonimous (sic) abuse\nthrown out in the federal papers against Mr.Jefferson, but until some\nnames could be got hold of it was fighting the air to take any notice\nof them.We have now got hold of two names, your townsman Hulbert, the\nhypocritical Infidel of Sheffield, and Thomas Turner of Virginia, his\ncorrespondent.I have already given Hulbert a basting with my name\nto it, because he made use of my name in his speech in the Mass.Turner has not given me the same cause in the letter he\nwrote (and evidently) to Hulbert, and which Hulbert, (for it could be\nno other person) has published in the Repertory to vindicate himself.Jefferson, and I have taken\nthem up one by one, which is the first time the opportunity has offered\nfor doing it; for before this it was promiscuous abuse.I have not\nsigned it either with my name or signature (Common Sense) because I\nfound myself obliged, in order to made such scoundrels feel a little\nsmart, to go somewhat out of my usual manner of writing, but there are\nsome sentiments and some expressions that will be supposed to be in my\nstile, and I have no objection to that supposition, but I do not wish\nMr.Jefferson to be _obliged_ to know it is from me."Since receiving your letter, which contained no direct information of\nany thing I wrote to you about, I have written myself to Mr.Barrett\naccompanied with a piece for the editor of the Baltimore Evening Post,\nwho is an acquaintance of his, but I have received no answer from Mr.B., neither has the piece been published in the Evening Post.I will be\nobliged to you to call on him & to inform me about it.You did not\ntell me if you called upon Foster; but at any rate do not delay the\nenclosed.--I do not trouble you with any messages or compliments, for\nyou never deliver any.* I am indebted for this letter to Mr.editor of the National Reformer,  London.By a minute comparison of the two alleged specifications of immorality,\nPaine proved that one was intrinsically absurd, and the other without\ntrustworthy testimony.As for the charge of cowardice, Paine contended\nthat it was the duty of a civil magistrate to move out of danger, as\nCongress had done in the Revolution.The article was signed "A Spark\nfrom the Altar of \'76," but the writer was easily recognized.The\nservice thus done Jefferson was greater than can now be easily realized.Another paper by Paine was on "Constitutions, Governments and\nCharters."It was an argument to prove the unconstitutionality in New\nYork of the power assumed by the legislature to grant charters.This\ndefeated the object of annual elections, by placing the act of one\nlegislature beyond the reach of its successor.He proposes that all\nmatters of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving grants\nof land and incorporations of companies, "shall be passed only by a\nlegislature succeeding the one in which it was proposed."Had such an\narticle been originally in the Constitution [of New York] the bribery\nand corruption employed to seduce and manage the members of the late\nlegislature, in the affair of the Merchants\' Bank, could not have taken\nplace.It would not have been worth while to bribe men to do what they\nhad no power of doing.Madame Bonneville hated country life, and insisted on going to New\nYork.Paine was not sorry to have her leave, as she could not yet talk\nEnglish, and did not appreciate Paine\'s idea of plain living and high\nthinking.She apparently had a notion that Paine had a mint of money,\nand, like so many others, might have attributed to parsimony efforts\nthe unpaid author was making to save enough to give her children,\npractically fatherless, some start in life.The philosophic solitude in\nwhich he was left at New Rochelle is described in a letter (July 31st)\nto John Fellows, in New York.Bonneville go into some family as\na teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for\nherself.I will take care of him for his\nown sake and his father\'s, but that is all I have to say.... I am\nmaster of an empty house, or nearly so.I have six chairs and a table, a\nstraw-bed, a featherbed, and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an\niron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,\nplates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of\nsnuffers.I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a\nChair, and a one-horse cart; a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs.When you come\nyou must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk,\nfruit-pies, plain dumplins, and a piece of meat when I get it; but I\nlive with that retirement and quiet that suit me.Bonneville was\nan encumbrance upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do\nanything, not even make an apple dumplin for her own children.If you\ncannot make yourself up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets, and\nyou will have no occasion to go over to the tavern to sleep."As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if\nthey have attempted any remarks or criticisms on my Eighth Letter, [or]\nthe piece on Constitutional Governments and Charters, the two numbers\non Turner\'s letter, and also the piece on Hulbert.As to anonymous\nparagraphs, it is not worth noticing them.I consider the generality of\nsuch editors only as a part of their press, and let them pass.--I want\nto come to Morrisania, and it is probable I may come on to N. Y., but I\nwish you to answer this letter first.--Yours in friendship."* I am indebted for an exact copy of the letter from which\n     this is extracted to-Dr.Garnett of the British Museum,\n     though it is not in that institution.It must not be supposed from what Paine says of Madame Bonneville that\nthere was anything acrimonious in their relations.She was thirty-one\nyears younger than Paine, fond of the world, handsome.The old\ngentleman, all day occupied with writing, could give her little\ncompanionship, even if he could have conversed in French, But he\nindulged her in every way, gave her more money than he could afford,\ndevoted his ever decreasing means to her family.She had boundless\nreverence for him, but, as we have seen, had no taste for country life.Probably, too, after Dederick\'s attempt on Paine\'s life she became\nnervous in the lonely house.So she had gone to New York, where she\npresently found good occupation as a teacher of French in several\nfamilies.Her sons, however, were fond of New Rochelle, and of Paine,\nwho had a knack of amusing children, and never failed to win their\naffection.*\n\n     * In the Tarrytown Argus, October 18, 1890, appeared an\n     interesting notice of the Rev.Alexander Davis (Methodist),\n     by C. K. B[uchanan] in which it is stated that Davis, a\n     native of New Rochelle, remembered the affection of Paine,\n     who "would bring him round-hearts and hold him on his knee."Many such recollections of his little neighbors have been\n     reported.The spring of 1805 at New Rochelle was a pleasant one for Paine.He wrote his last political pamphlet, which was printed by Duane,\nPhiladelphia, with the title: "Thomas Paine to the Citizens of\nPennsylvania, on the Proposal for Calling a Convention."It opens with a\nreference to his former life and work in Philadelphia."Removed as I\nnow am from the place, and detached from everything of personal party, I\naddress this token to you on the ground of principle, and in remembrance\nof former times and friendships."He gives an historical account of the\nnegative or veto-power, finding it the English Parliament\'s badge of\ndisgrace under William of Normandy, a defence of personal prerogative\nthat ought to find no place in a republic.He advises that in the new\nConstitution the principle of arbitration, outside of courts, should\nbe established.The governor should possess no power of patronage; he\nshould make one in a Council of Appointments.The Senate is an imitation\nof the House of Lords.The Representatives should be divided by lot into\ntwo equal parts, sitting in different chambers.One half, by not\nbeing entangled in the debate of the other on the issue submitted, nor\ncommitted by voting, would become silently possessed of the arguments,\nand be in a calm position to review the whole.The votes of the two\nhouses should be added together, and the majority decide.Judges should\nbe removable by some constitutional mode, without the formality of\nimpeachment at "stated periods."(In 1807 Paine wrote to Senator\nMitchell of New York suggesting an amendment to the Constitution of the\nUnited States by which judges of the Supreme Court might be removed by\nthe President for reasonable cause, though insufficient for impeachment,\non the address of a majority of both Houses of Congress.)In this pamphlet was included the paper already mentioned (on Charters,\netc.The two essays prove that\nthere was no abatement in Paine\'s intellect, and that despite occasional\n"flings" at the "Feds,"--retorts on their perpetual naggings,--he was\nstill occupied with the principles of political philosophy.At this time Paine had put the two young Bon-nevilles at a school in\nNew Rochelle, where they also boarded.He had too much solitude in the\nhouse, and too little nourishment for so much work.So the house was let\nand he was taken in as a boarder by Mrs.Bayeaux, in the old Bayeaux\nHouse, which is still standing,*--but Paine\'s pecuniary situation now\ngave him anxiety.He was earning nothing, his means were found to be\nfar less than he supposed, the needs of the Bonnevilles increasing.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the\nPresident, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to\nallude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,\nhad once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He\nsuggests that Congress should remember his services.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine\'s letter about\n     Dederick\'s attempt on his life."But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take\nit will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been\na volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from\nanything I have published in America or Europe.I have relinquished all\nprofits that those publications might come cheap among the people for\nwhom they were intended--Yours in friendship."This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been\nreceived.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on "The cause of the Yellow\nFever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with\nit Addressed to the Board of Health in America."The treatise, which he\ndates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out\nthat the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been\nunknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not\nreach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease\ncertainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from\nNew York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of\nthe wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the\nWest Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves\nwere built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the\nshore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter\ndecaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of\narches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder\'s Hook and on the\nNorth River.Francis justly remarks, in his "Old New York," that Paine\'s writings\nwere usually suggested by some occasion.Besides this instance of the\nessay on the yellow fever, he mentions one on the origin of Freemasonry,\nthere being an agitation in New York concerning that fraternity.But this essay---in which Paine, with ingenuity and learning, traces\nFreemasonry to the ancient solar mythology also identified with\nChristian mythology--was not published during his life.It was published\nby Madame Bonneville with the passages affecting Christianity omitted.The original manuscript was obtained, however, and published with an\nextended preface, criticizing Paine\'s theory, the preface being in\nturn criticized by Paine\'s editor.The preface was probably written by\nColonel Fellows, author of a large work on Freemasonry.A NEW YORK PROMETHEUS\n\nWhen Paine left Bordentown, on March 1st 1803, driving past placards of\nthe devil flying away with him, and hooted by a pious mob at Trenton,\nit was with hope of a happy reunion with old friends in more enlightened\nNew York.Few, formerly senator from Georgia, his friend of many\nyears, married Paine\'s correspondent, Kitty Nicholson, to whom was\nwritten the beautiful letter from London (L, p.Few had\nbecome a leading man in New York, and his home, and that of the\nNicholsons, were of highest social distinction.Paine\'s arrival at\nLovett\'s Hotel was well known, but not one of those former friends came\nnear him."They were actively as well as passively religious," says\nHenry Adams, "and their relations with Paine after his return to America\nin 1802 were those of compassion only, for his intemperate and offensive\nhabits, and intimacy was impossible.Adams will vainly search\nhis materials for any intimation at that time of the intemperate or\noffensive habits.Gallatin continued to risk\n     Paine.360\n\nThe "compassion" is due to those devotees of an idol requiring sacrifice\nof friendship, loyalty, and intelligence.The\nold author was as a grand organ from which a cunning hand might bring\nmusic to be remembered through the generations.In that brain were\nstored memories of the great Americans, Frenchmen, Englishmen who acted\nin the revolutionary dramas, and of whom he loved to talk.What would a\ndiary of interviews with Paine, written by his friend Kitty Few, be now\nworth?To intolerance, the least pardonable form of ignorance, must be\ncredited the failure of those former friends, who supposed themselves\neducated, to make more of Thomas Paine than a scarred monument of an Age\nof Unreason.But the ostracism of Paine by the society which, as Henry Adams states,\nhad once courted him "as the greatest literary genius of his day,"\nwas not due merely to his religious views, which were those of various\nstatesmen who had incurred no such odium.There was at work a lingering\ndislike and distrust of the common people.From the scholastic study, where heresies once\nwritten only in Latin were daintily wrapped up in metaphysics, from\ndrawing-rooms where cynical smiles went round at Methodism, and other\nforms of "Christianity in earnest," Paine carried heresy to the people.And he brought it as a religion,--as fire from the fervid heaven\nthat orthodoxy had monopolized.The popularity of his writing, the\nrevivalistic earnestness of his protest against dogmas common to all\nsects, were revolutionary; and while the vulgar bigots were binding him\non their rock of ages, and tearing his vitals, most of the educated, the\nsocial leaders, were too prudent to manifest any sympathy they may have\nfelt.**\n\n     * When Paine first reached New York, 1803, he was (March\n     5th) entertained at supper by John Crauford.For being\n     present Eliakira Ford, a Baptist elder, was furiously\n     denounced, as were others of the company.** An exception was the leading Presbyterian, John Mason,\n     who lived to denounce Channing as "the devil\'s disciple."Grant Thorbura was psalm-singer in this Scotch preacher\'s\n     church.Curiosity to see the lion led Thorburn to visit\n     Paine, for which he was "suspended."Thorburn afterwards\n     made amends by fathering Cheetham\'s slanders of Paine after\n     Cheetham had become too infamous to quote.It were unjust to suppose that Paine met with nothing but abuse and\nmaltreatment from ministers of serious orthodoxy in New York.They had\nwarmly opposed his views, even denounced them, but the controversy seems\nto have died away until he took part in the deistic propaganda of Elihu\nPalmer.\'Fellows (July 31st) shows Paine much\ninterested in the "cause":\n\n"I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together.I enclose a letter I received a few days since from\nGroton, in Connecticut The letter is well written, and with a good deal\nof sincere enthusiasm.The publication of it would do good, but there is\nan impropriety in publishing a man\'s name to a private letter.You\nmay show the letter to Palmer and Foster.... Remember me to my much\nrespected friend Carver and tell him I am sure we shall succeed if we\nhold on.We have already silenced the clamor of the priests.They act\nnow as if they would say, let us alone and we will let you alone.You do\nnot tell me if the Prospect goes on.As Carver will want pay he may have\nit from me, and pay when it suits him; but I expect he will take a ride\nup some Saturday, and then he can chuse for himself."The result of this was that Paine passed the winter in New York,\nwhere he threw himself warmly into the theistic movement, and no doubt\noccasionally spoke from Elihu Palmer\'s platform.The rationalists who gathered around Elihu Palmer in New York were\ncalled the "Columbian Illuminati."The pompous epithet looks like an\neffort to connect them with the Columbian Order (Tammany) which was\nsupposed to represent Jacobinism and French ideas generally.Their\nnumbers were considerable, but they did not belong to fashionable\nsociety.Their lecturer, Elihu Palmer, was a scholarly gentleman of the\nhighest character.A native of Canterbury, Connecticut, (born 1754) he\nhad graduated at Dartmouth.Watt to\na widow, Mary Powell, in New York (1803), at the time when he was\nlecturing in the Temple of Reason (Snow\'s Rooms, Broadway).This\nsuggests that he had not broken with the clergy altogether.Somewhat\nlater he lectured at the Union Hotel, William Street He had studied\ndivinity, and turned against the creeds what was taught him for their\nsupport."I have more than once [says Dr.Francis] listened to Palmer; none could\nbe weary within the sound of his voice; his diction was classical; and\nmuch of his natural theology attractive by variety of illustration.But admiration of him sank into despondency at his assumption, and his\nsarcastic assaults on things most holy.His boldest phillippic was his\ndiscourse on the title-page of the Bible, in which, with the double\nshield of jacobinism and infidelity, he warned rising America against\nconfidence in a book authorised by the monarchy of England.Palmer\ndelivered his sermons in the Union Hotel in William Street."Francis does not appear to have known Paine personally, but had seen\nhim.Palmer\'s chief friends in New York were, he says, John Fellows;\nRose, an unfortunate lawyer; Taylor, a philanthropist; and Charles\nChristian.John Foster, another rationalist lecturer, Dr.Francis says he had a noble presence and great eloquence.Foster\'s\nexordium was an invocation to the goddess of Liberty.John Fellows, always the devoted friend of Paine, was an\nauctioneer, but in later life was a constable in the city courts.He\nhas left three volumes which show considerable literary ability, and\nindustrious research; but these were unfortunately bestowed on such\nextinct subjects as Freemasonry, the secret of Junius, and controversies\nconcerning General Putnam.It is much to be regretted that Colonel\nFellows should not have left a volume concerning Paine, with whom he was\nin especial intimacy, during his last years.Other friends of Paine were Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton, a lawyer,\nand Judge Hertell, a man of wealth, and a distinguished member of the\nState Assembly.Fulton also was much in New York, and often called on\nPaine.Paine was induced to board at the house of William Carver (36\nCedar Street), which proved a grievous mistake.Carver had introduced\nhimself to Paine, saying that he remembered him when he was an exciseman\nat Lewes, England, he (Carver) being a young farrier there.He made loud\nprofessions of deism, and of devotion to Paine.The farrier of Lewes\nhad become a veterinary practitioner and shopkeeper in New York.Paine supposed that he would be cared for in the house of this active\nrationalist, but the man and his family were illiterate and vulgar.His sojourn at Carver\'s probably shortened Paine\'s life.Carver, to\nanticipate the narrative a little, turned out to be a bad-hearted man\nand a traitor.Paine had accumulated a mass of fragmentary writings on religious\nsubjects, and had begun publishing them in a journal started in 1804\nby Elihu Palmer,--_The Prospect; or View of the Moral World_.This\nsucceeded the paper called _The Temple of Reason_.One of Paine\'s\nobjects was to help the new journal, which attracted a good deal of\nattention.His first communication (February 18, 1804), was on a sermon\nby Robert Hall, on "Modern Infidelity," sent him by a gentleman in New\nYork.The following are some of its trenchant paragraphs:\n\n"Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and\nhow is it proved?If a God he could not die, and as a man he could not\nredeem: how then is this redemption proved to be fact?It is said that\nAdam eat of the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby\nsubjected himself and all his posterity forever to eternal damnation.This is worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children\nunto the third and fourth generations.But how was the death of Jesus\nChrist to affect or alter the case?If so,\nwould it not have been better to have crucified Adam upon the forbidden\ntree, and made a new man?""Why do not the Christians, to be consistent, make Saints of Judas and\nPontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the act of\nsalvation.The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it,\nwas never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the\nsacrifice--and therefore Judas and Pilate ought to stand first in the\ncalendar of Saints."Other contributions to the _Prospect_ were: "Of the word Religion";\n"Cain and Abel"; "The Tower of Babel"; "Of the religion of Deism\ncompared with the Christian Religion"; "Of the Sabbath Day in\nConnecticut"; "Of the Old and New Testaments"; "Hints towards forming a\nSociety for inquiring into the truth or falsehood of ancient history,\nso far as history is connected with systems of religion ancient and\nmodern"; "To the members of the Society styling itself the Missionary\nSociety"; "On Deism, and the writings of Thomas Paine"; "Of the Books\nof the New Testament" There were several communications without any\nheading.Passages and sentences from these little essays have long been\na familiar currency among freethinkers."We admire the wisdom of the ancients, yet they had no bibles, nor\nbooks, called revelation.They cultivated the reason that God gave them,\nstudied him in his works, and rose to eminence.""The Cain and Abel of Genesis appear to be no other than the ancient\nEgyptian story of Typhon and Osiris, the darkness and the light, which\nanswered very well as allegory without being believed as fact.""Those who most believe the Bible are those who know least about it.""Another observation upon the story of Babel is the inconsistence of it\nwith respect to the opinion that the bible is the word of God given for\nthe information of mankind; for nothing could so effectually prevent\nsuch a word being known by mankind as confounding their language.""God has not given us reason for the purpose of confounding us.""Jesus never speaks of Adam, of the Garden of Eden, nor of what is\ncalled the fall of man.""Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians\nthemselves carry on?"[On the presentation of a Bible to some Osage\nchiefs in New York.]"The remark of the Emperor Julian is worth observing.\'If, said he,\n\'there ever had been or could be a Tree of Knowledge, instead of God\nforbidding man to eat thereof, it would be that of which he would order\nhim to eat the most.\'""Do Christians not see that their own religion is founded on a human\nsacrifice?Many thousands of human sacrifices have since been offered on\nthe altar of the Christian Religion.""For several centuries past the dispute has been about doctrines."The Bible has been received by Protestants on the authority of the\nChurch of Rome.""The same degree of hearsay evidence, and that at third and fourth hand,\nwould not, in a court of justice, give a man title to a cottage, and\nyet the priests of this profession presumptuously promise their deluded\nfollowers the kingdom of Heaven.""Nobody fears for the safety of a mountain, but a hillock of sand may\nbe washed away.Blow then, O ye priests, \'the Trumpet in Zion,\' for the\nHillock is in danger."The force of Paine\'s negations was not broken by any weakness for\nspeculations of his own.He constructed no system to invite the missiles\nof antagonists.It is, indeed, impossible to deny without affirming;\ndenial that two and two make five affirms that they make four.The basis\nof Paine\'s denials being the divine wisdom and benevolence, there was in\nhis use of such expressions an implication of limitation in the divine\nnature.Wisdom implies the necessity of dealing with difficulties, and\nbenevolence the effort to make all sentient creatures happy.Neither\nquality is predicable of an omniscient and omnipotent being, for whom\nthere could be no difficulties or evils to overcome.confuse the world with his doubts or with his mere opinions.He stuck to\nhis certainties, that the scriptural deity was not the true one, nor\nthe dogmas called Christian reasonable.But he felt some of the moral\ndifficulties surrounding theism, and these were indicated in his reply\nto the Bishop of Llandaff."The Book of Job belongs either to the ancient Persians, the Chaldeans,\nor the Egyptians; because the structure of it is consistent with the\ndogma they held, that of a good and evil spirit, called in Job God\nand Satan, existing as distinct and separate beings, and it is not\nconsistent with any dogma of the Jews.... The God of the Jews was the\nGod of everything.According to Exodus\nit was God, and not the Devil, that hardened Pharaoh\'s heart.According\nto the Book of Samuel it was an evil spirit from God that troubled\nSaul.And Ezekiel makes God say, in speaking of the Jews, \'I gave them\nstatutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not\nlive.\'...As to the precepts, principles, and maxims in the Book of Job,\nthey show that the people abusively called the heathen, in the books\nof the Jews, had the most sublime ideas of the Creator, and the most\nexalted devotional morality.It was\nthe Gentiles who glorified him."Several passages in Paine\'s works show that he did not believe in a\npersonal devil; just what he did believe was no doubt written in a part\nof his reply to the Bishop, which, unfortunately, he did not live to\ncarry through the press.In the part that we have he expresses\nthe opinion that the Serpent of Genesis is an allegory of winter,\nnecessitating the "coats of skins" to keep Adam and Eve warm, and adds:\n"Of these things I shall speak fully when I come in another part to\nspeak of the ancient religion of the Persians, and compare it with the\nmodern religion of the New Testament" But this part was never published.The part published was transcribed by Paine and given, not long before\nhis death, to the widow of Elihu Palmer, who published it in the\n_Theophilanthropist_ in 1810.Paine had kept the other part, no doubt\nfor revision, and it passed with his effects into the hands of Madame\nBonneville, who eventually became a devotee.She either suppressed it or\nsold it to some one who destroyed it.We can therefore only infer from\nthe above extract the author\'s belief on this momentous point.It seems\nclear that he did not attribute any evil to the divine Being.In the\nlast article Paine published he rebukes the "Predestinarians" for\ndwelling mainly on God\'s "physical attribute" of power."The Deists, in\naddition to this, believe in his moral attributes, those of justice and\ngoodness."Among Paine\'s papers was found one entitled "My private thoughts of a\nFuture State," from which his editors have dropped important sentences."I have said in the first part of the Age of Reason that \'I hope for\nhappiness after this life,\' This hope is comfortable to me, and I\npresume not to go beyond the comfortable idea of hope, with respect to a\nfuture state.I consider myself in the hands of my Creator, and that he\nwill dispose of me after this life, consistently with his justice and\ngoodness.I leave all these matters to him as my Creator and friend,\nand I hold it to be presumption in man to make an article of faith as to\nwhat the Creator will do with us hereafter.I do not believe, because\na man and a woman make a child, that it imposes on the Creator the\nunavoidable obligation of keeping the being so made in eternal existence\nhereafter.It is in his power to do so, or not to do so, and it is not\nin our power to decide which he will do."[After quoting from Matthew\n25th the figure of the sheep and goats he continues:] "The world cannot\nbe thus divided.The moral world, like the physical world, is composed\nof numerous degrees of character, running imperceptibly one into the\nother, in such a manner that no fixed point can be found in either.That\npoint is nowhere, or is everywhere.The whole world might be divided\ninto two parts numerically, but not as to moral character; and therefore\nthe metaphor of dividing them, as sheep and goats can be divided, whose\ndifference is marked by their external figure, is absurd.All sheep are\nstill sheep; all goats are still goats; it is their physical nature to\nbe so.But one part of the world are not all good alike, nor the\nother part all wicked alike.There are some exceedingly good, others\nexceedingly wicked.There is another description of men who cannot be\nranked with either the one or the other--they belong neither to the\nsheep nor the goats.And there is still another description of them who\nare so very insignificant, both in character and conduct, as not to be\nworth the trouble of damning or saving, or of raising from the dead.My\nown opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good,\nand endeavouring to make their fellow mortals happy, for this is the\nonly way in which we can serve God, will be happy hereafter; and that\nthe very wicked will meet with some punishment.But those who are\nneither good nor bad, or are too insignificant for notice, will be dropt\nentirely.It is consistent with my idea of God\'s\njustice, and with the reason that God has given me, and I gratefully\nknow that he has given me a large share of that divine gift."The closing tribute to his own reason, written in privacy, was, perhaps\npardonably, suppressed by the modern editor, and also the reference to\nthe insignificant who "will be dropt entirely."This sentiment is not\nindeed democratic, but it is significant.It seems plain that Paine\'s\nconception of the universe was dualistic.Though he discards the notion\nof a devil, I do not find that he ever ridicules it.No doubt he would,\nwere he now living, incline to a division of nature into organic and\ninorganic, and find his deity, as Zoroaster did, in the living as\ndistinguished from, and sometimes in antagonism with, the "not-living".In this belief he would now find himself in harmony with some of the\nablest modern philosophers.*\n\n     * John Stuart Mill, for instance.Abbott\'s "Kernel and Husk" (London), and the great work of\n     Samuel Laing, "A Modern Zoroastrian."{1806}\n\nThe opening year 1806 found Paine in New Rochelle.By insufficient\nnourishment in Carver\'s house his health was impaired.His means were\ngetting low, insomuch that to support the Bonnevilles he had to sell the\nBordentown house and property.*\n\n     * It was bought for $300 by his friend John Oliver, whose\n     daughter, still residing in the house, told me that her\n     father to the end of his life "thought everything of Paine."John Oliver, in his old age, visited Colonel Ingersoll in\n     order to testify against the aspersions on Paine\'s character\n     and habits.Elihu Palmer had gone off to Philadelphia for a time; he died there of\nyellow fever in 1806.The few intelligent people whom Paine knew were\nmuch occupied, and he was almost without congenial society.His hint to\nJefferson of his impending poverty, and his reminder that Virginia had\nnot yet given him the honorarium he and Madison approved, had brought\nno result.With all this, and the loss of early friendships, and the\ntheological hornet-nest he had found in New York, Paine began to feel\nthat his return to America was a mistake.The air-castle that had allured him to his beloved land had faded.His\nlittle room with the Bonnevilles in Paris, with its chaos of papers, was\npreferable; for there at least he could enjoy the society of educated\npersons, free from bigotry.He dwelt a stranger in his Land of Promise.So he resolved to try and free himself from his depressing environment.Jefferson had offered him a ship to\nreturn in, perhaps he would now help him to get back.30th) a letter to the President, pointing out the probabilities of a\ncrisis in Europe which must result in either a descent on England by\nBonaparte, or in a treaty.In the case that the people of England should\nbe thus liberated from tyranny, he (Paine) desired to share with his\nfriends there the task of framing a republic.Should there be, on the\nother hand, a treaty of peace, it would be of paramount interest to\nAmerican shipping that such treaty should include that maritime compact,\nor safety of the seas for neutral ships, of which Paine had written\nso much, and which Jefferson himself had caused to be printed in a\npamphlet.Both of these were, therefore, Paine\'s subjects."I think," he\nsays, "you will find it proper, perhaps necessary, to send a person to\nFrance in the event of either a treaty or a descent, and I make you an\noffer of my services on that occasion to join Mr.Monroe.... As I think\nthat the letters of a friend to a friend have some claim to an answer,\nit will be agreeable to me to receive an answer to this, but without any\nwish that you should commit yourself, neither can you be a judge of what\nis proper or necessary to be done till about the month of April or May."Paine must face the fact that his\ncareer is ended.It is probable that Elihu Palmer\'s visit to Philadelphia was connected\nwith some theistic movement in that city.How it was met, and what\nannoyances Paine had to suffer, are partly intimated in the following\nletter, printed in the Philadelphia _Commercial Advertiser_, February\n10, 1806."To John Inskeep, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia."I saw in the Aurora of January the 30th a piece addressed to you and\nsigned Isaac Hall.It contains a statement of your malevolent conduct in\nrefusing to let him have Vine-st.Wharf after he had bid fifty\ndollars more rent for it than another person had offered, and had been\nunanimously approved of by the Commissioners appointed by law for that\npurpose.Among the reasons given by you for this refusal, one was, that\n\'_Mr Hall was one of Paine\'s disciples_.\'If those whom you may chuse to\ncall my disciples follow my example in doing good to mankind, they will\npass the confines of this world with a happy mind, while the hope of the\nhypocrite shall perish and delusion sink into despair.Inskeep is, for I do not remember the name of\nInskeep at Philadelphia in \'_the time that tried men\'s souls._* He must\nbe some mushroom of modern growth that has started up on the soil which\nthe generous services of Thomas Paine contributed to bless with freedom;\nneither do I know what profession of religion he is of, nor do I care,\nfor if he is a man malevolent and unjust, it signifies not to what class\nor sectary he may hypocritically belong."As I set too much value on my time to waste it on a man of so little\nconsequence as yourself, I will close this short address with a\ndeclaration that puts hypocrisy and malevolence to defiance.Here it is:\nMy motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common\nSense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from\ntyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable\nhim to be free, and establish government for himself; and I have borne\nmy share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made\nfor this purpose.And my motive and object in all my publications on\nreligious subjects, beginning with the first part of the Age of Reason,\nhave been to bring man to a right reason that God has given him; to\nimpress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, mercy,\nand a benevolent disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to\nexcite in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation in his\ncreator, unshackled by the fable and fiction of books, by whatever\ninvented name they may be called.I am happy in the continual\ncontemplation of what I have done, and I thank God that he gave\nme talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it It will make the\ncontinual consolation of my departing hours, whenever they finally\narrive."\'_These are the times that try men\'s souls_.\'1, written\nwhile on the retreat with the army from fort Lee to the Delaware and\npublished in Philadelphia in the dark days of 1776 December the 19th,\nsix days before the taking of the Hessians at Trenton."But the year 1806 had a heavier blow yet to inflict on Paine, and\nit naturally came, though in a roundabout way, from his old enemy\nGouverneur Morris.While at New Rochelle, Paine offered his vote at the\nelection, and it was refused, on the ground that he was not an American\ncitizen!The supervisor declared that the former American Minister,\nGouverneur Morris, had refused to reclaim him from a French prison\nbecause he was not an American, and that Washington had also refused to\nreclaim him.Gouverneur Morris had just lost his seat in Congress,\nand was politically defunct, but his ghost thus rose on poor Paine\'s\npathway.The supervisor who disfranchised the author of "Common Sense"\nhad been a "Tory" in the Revolution; the man he disfranchised was one to\nwhom the President of the United States had written, five years before:\n"I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments\nworthy of former times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily\nlabored, and with as much effect as any man living."There was not any\nquestion of Paine\'s qualification as a voter on other grounds than the\nsupervisor (Elisha Ward) raised.More must presently be said concerning\nthis incident.Paine announced his intention of suing the inspectors,\nbut meanwhile he had to leave the polls in humiliation.It was the fate\nof this founder of republics to be a monument of their ingratitude.And\nnow Paine\'s health began to fail.An intimation of this appears in a\nletter to Andrew A. Dean, to whom his farm at New Rochelle was let,\ndated from New York, August, 1806.It is in reply to a letter from Dean\non a manuscript which Paine had lent him.*\n\n     * "I have read," says Dean,  "with good attention your\n     manuscript on dreams, and Examination of the Prophecies in\n     the Bible.I am now searching the old prophecies, and\n     comparing the same to those said to be quoted in the New\n     Testament.I confess the comparison is a matter worthy of\n     our serious attention; I know not the result till I finish;\n     then, if you be living, I shall communicate the same to\n     you.Paine was now living with\n     Jarvis, the artist.One evening he fell as if by apoplexy,\n     and, as he lay, his first word was (to Jarvis): "My\n     corporeal functions have ceased; my intellect is clear;\n     this is a proof of immortality.""Respected Friend: I received your friendly letter, for which I am\nobliged to you.It is three weeks ago to day (Sunday, Aug.15,) that I\nwas struck with a fit of an apoplexy, that deprived me of all sense\nand motion.I had neither pulse nor breathing, and the people about me\nsupposed me dead.I had felt exceedingly well that day, and had just\ntaken a slice of bread and butter for supper, and was going to bed.The\nfit took me on the stairs, as suddenly as if I had been shot through the\nhead; and I got so very much hurt by the fall, that I have not been able\nto get in and out of bed since that day, otherwise than being lifted\nout in a blanket, by two persons; yet all this while my mental faculties\nhave remained as perfect as I ever enjoyed them.I consider the scene I\nhave passed through as an experiment on dying, and I find death has\nno terrors for me.As to the people called Christians, they have no\nevidence that their religion is true.There is no more proof that the\nBible is the word of God, than that the Koran of Mahomet is the word of\nGod.Man, before he begins to\nthink for himself, is as much the child of habit in Creeds as he is in\nploughing and sowing.Yet creeds, like opinions, prove nothing.Where is\nthe evidence that the person called Jesus Christ is the begotten Son of\nGod?The case admits not of evidence either to our senses or our mental\nfaculties: neither has God given to man any talent by which such a thing\nis comprehensible.It cannot therefore be an object for faith to\nact upon, for faith is nothing more than an assent the mind gives to\nsomething it sees cause to believe is fact.But priests, preachers, and\nfanatics, put imagination in the place of faith, and it is the nature\nof the imagination to believe without evidence.If Joseph the carpenter\ndreamed (as the book of Matthew, chapter 1st, says he did,) that his\nbetrothed wife, Mary, was with child by the Holy Ghost, and that an\nangel told him so, I am not obliged to put faith in his dream; nor do I\nput any, for I put no faith in my own dreams, and I should be weak and\nfoolish indeed to put faith in the dreams of others.--The Christian\nreligion is derogatory to the Creator in all its articles.It puts the\nCreator in an inferior point of view, and places the Christian Devil\nabove him.It is he, according to the absurd story in Genesis, that\noutwits the Creator, in the garden of Eden, and steals from him his\nfavorite creature, man; and, at last, obliges him to beget a son, and\nput that son to death, to get man back again.And this the priests of\nthe Christian religion, call redemption."Christian authors exclaim against the practice of offering human\nsacrifices, which, they say, is done in some countries; and those\nauthors make those exclamations without ever reflecting that their own\ndoctrine of salvation is founded on a human sacrifice.They are saved,\nthey say, by the blood of Christ.The Christian religion begins with a\ndream and ends with a murder."As I am well enough to sit up some hours in the day, though not well\nenough to get up without help, I employ myself as I have always done,\nin endeavoring to bring man to the right use of the reason that God has\ngiven him, and to direct his mind immediately to his Creator, and not to\nfanciful secondary beings called mediators, as if God was superannuated\nor ferocious."As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the word of\nGod.It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times\nand bad men.There are but a few good characters in the whole book.The\nfable of Christ and his twelve apostles, which is a parody on the sun\nand the twelve signs of the Zodiac, copied from the ancient religions of\nthe eastern world, is the least hurtful part.Every thing told of Christ\nhas reference to the sun.His reported resurrection is at sunrise,\nand that on the first day of the week; that is, on the day anciently\ndedicated to the sun, and from thence called Sunday; in latin Dies\nSolis, the day of the sun; as the next day, Monday, is Moon day.But\nthere is no room in a letter to explain these things.While man keeps\nto the belief of one God, his reason unites with his creed.He is not\nshocked with contradictions and horrid stories.His bible is the heavens\nand the earth.He beholds his Creator in all his works, and every thing\nhe beholds inspires him with reverence and gratitude.From the goodness\nof God to all, he learns his duty to his fellow-man, and stands\nself-reproved when he transgresses it.But\nwhen he multiplies his creed with imaginary things, of which he can have\nneither evidence nor conception, such as the tale of the garden of\nEden, the talking serpent, the fall of man, the dreams of Joseph the\ncarpenter, the pretended resurrection and ascension, of which there is\neven no historical relation, for no historian of those times mentions\nsuch a thing, he gets into the pathless region of confusion, and turns\neither frantic or hypocrite.He forces his mind, and pretends to\nbelieve what he does not believe.This is in general the case with the\nMethodists."I have now my friend given you a fac-simile of my mind on the subject\nof religion and creeds, and my wish is, that you may make this letter as\npublicly known as you find opportunities of doing.{1807}\n\nThe "Essay on Dream" was written early in 1806 and printed in May,\n1807.It was the last work of importance written by Paine.In the same\npamphlet was included a part of his reply to the Bishop of Llandaff,\nwhich was written in France: "An Examination of the Passages in the New\nTestament, quoted from the Old, and called Prophecies of the Coming\nof Jesus Christ" The Examination is widely known and is among Paine\'s\ncharacteristic works,--a continuation of the "Age of Reason."The "Essay\non Dream" is a fine specimen of the author\'s literary art.Dream is the\nimagination awake while the judgment is asleep."Every person is mad\nonce in twenty-four hours; for were he to act in the day as he dreams\nin the night, he would be confined for a lunatic."Nathaniel Hawthorne\nthought spiritualism "a sort of dreaming awake."Paine explained in the\nsame way some of the stories on which popular religion is founded.The\nincarnation itself rests on what an angel told Joseph in a dream, and\nothers are referred to."This story of dreams has thrown Europe into\na dream for more than a thousand years.All the efforts that nature,\nreason, and conscience have made to awaken man from it have been\nascribed by priestcraft and superstition to the workings of the devil,\nand had it not been for the American revolution, which by establishing\nthe universal right of conscience, first opened the way to free\ndiscussion, and for the French revolution which followed, this religion\nof dreams had continued to be preached, and that after it had ceased to\nbe believed."But Paine was to be reminded that the revolution had not made conscience\nfree enough in America to challenge waking dreams without penalties.The\nfollowing account of his disfranchisement at New Rochelle, was written\nfrom Broome St., New York, May 4, 1807, to Vice-President Clinton."Respected Friend,--Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories who\nlived within the british lines in the revolutionary war, got in to\nbe inspectors of the election last year at New Rochelle.These men refused my vote at the election, saying to me:\n\'You are not an American; our minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris,\nwould not reclaim you when you were emprisoned in the Luxembourg prison\nat Paris, and General Washington refused to do it.\'Upon my telling\nhim that the two cases he stated were falsehoods, and that if he did me\ninjustice I would prosecute him, he got up, and calling for a constable,\nsaid to me, \'I will commit you to prison.\'He chose, however, to sit\ndown and go no farther with it.Monro\'s\nletter to the then Secretary of State Randolph, in which Mr.Monro gives\nthe government an account of his reclaiming me and my liberation in\nconsequence of it; and also for an attested copy of Mr.Randolph\'s\nanswer, in which he says: \'The President approves what you have done in\nthe case of Mr.The matter I believe is, that, as I had not\nbeen guillotined, Washington thought best to say what he did.As\nto Gouverneur Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me; but his\nreclamation did me no good, and the probability is, he did not intend it\nshould.Joel Barlow and other Americans in Paris had been in a body to\nreclaim me, but their application, being unofficial, was not regarded.I shall subpoena Morris, and if I get attested\ncopies from the Secretary of State\'s office it will prove the lie on the\ninspectors."As it is a new generation that has risen up since the declaration\nof independence, they know nothing of what the political state of\nthe country was at the time the pamphlet \'Common Sense\' appeared; and\nbesides this there are but few of the old standers left, and none that I\nknow of in this city."It may be proper at the trial to bring the mind of the court and the\njury back to the times I am speaking of, and if you see no objection in\nyour way, I wish you would write a letter to some person, stating, from\nyour own knowledge, what the condition of those times were, and the\neffect which the work \'Common Sense,\' and the several members (numbers)\nof the \'Crisis\' had upon the country.It would, I think, be best that\nthe letter should begin directly on the subject in this manner: Being\ninformed that Thomas Paine has been denied his rights of citizenship by\ncertain persons acting as inspectors at an election at New Rochelle, &c."I have put the prosecution into the hands of Mr.Riker, district\nattorney, who can make use of the letter in his address to the Court and\nJury.Your handwriting can be sworn to by persons here, if necessary.Had you been on the spot I should have subpoenaed you, unless it had\nbeen too inconvenient to you to have attended.To this Clinton replied from Washington, 12th May, 1807:\n\n"Dear Sir,--I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 4th\ninstant, yesterday; agreeably to your request I have this day written a\nletter to Richard Riker, Esquire, which he will show you.I doubt much,\nhowever, whether the Court will admit it to be read as evidence."I am indebted to you for a former letter.I can make no other apology\nfor not acknowledging it before than inability to give you such an\nanswer as I could wish.I constantly keep the subject in mind, and\nshould any favorable change take place in the sentiments of the\nLegislature, I will apprize you of it."I am, with great esteem, your sincere friend."In the letter to Madison, Paine tells the same story.At the end he says\nthat Morris\' reclamation was not out of any good will to him."I know\nnot what he wrote to the french minister; whatever it was he concealed\nit from me."He also says Morris could hardly keep himself out of\nprison.*\n\n     * The letter is in Mr.Frederick McGuire\'s collection of\n     Madison papers.A letter was also written to Joel Barlow, at Washington, dated Broome\nStreet, New York, May 4th.He says in this:\n\n"I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me.You\nand other Americans in Paris went in a body to the Convention to reclaim\nme, and I want a certificate from you, properly attested, of this fact.Clinton he will in friendship inform you who to\naddress it to."Having now done with business I come to meums and tuums.You sometimes hear of me but I never hear of you.It seems as if\nI had got to be master of the feds and the priests.The former do not\nattack my political publications; they rather try to keep them out of\nsight by silence.And as to the priests, they act as if they would say,\nlet us alone and we will let you alone.My Examination of the passages\ncalled prophecies is printed, and will be published next week.I have\nprepared it with the Essay on Dream.I do not believe that the priests\nwill attack it, for it is not a book of opinions but of facts.Had the\nChristian Religion done any good in the world I would not have exposed\nit, however fabulous I might believe it to be.But the delusive idea of\nhaving a friend at court whom they call a redeemer, who pays all their\nscores, is an encouragement to wickedness.Is he taming a whale to draw his submarine\nboat?Smith to send me his country National\nIntelligencer.I\nam somewhat at a loss for want of authentic intelligence.It will be seen that Paine was still in ignorance of the conspiracy\nwhich had thrown him in prison, nor did he suspect that Washington\nhad been deceived by Gouverneur Morris, and that his private letter to\nWashington might have been given over to Pickering.*\n\n     * In Chapter X. of this volume, as originally printed, there\n     were certain passages erroneously suggesting that Pickering\n     might have even intercepted this important letter of\n     September 20, 1795.I had not then observed a reference to\n     that letter by Madison, in writing to Monroe (April 7,\n     1796), which proves that Paine\'s communication to Washington\n     had been read by Pickering.Monroe was anxious lest some\n     attack on the President should be written by Paine while\n     under his roof,--an impropriety avoided by Paine as we have\n     seen,--and had written to Madison on the subject.Madison\n     answers: "I have given the explanation you desired to F. A.\n     M[uhlenberg], who has not received any letter as yet, and\n     has promised to pay due regard to your request.It is proper\n     you should know that Thomas Paine wrote some time ago a\n     severe letter to the President which Pickering mentioned to\n     me in harsh terms when I delivered a note from Thomas Paine\n     to the Secretary of State, inclosed by T. P. in a letter to\n     me.Nothing passed, however, that betrayed the least\n     association of your patronage or attention to Thomas Paine\n     with the circumstance; nor am I apprehensive that any real\n     suspicion can exist of your countenancing or even knowing\n     the steps taken by T. P. under the influence of his personal\n     feelings or political principles.At the same time the\n     caution you observe is by no means to be disapproved.Be so\n     good as to let T. P. know that I have received his letter\n     and handed his note to the Secretary of State, which\n     requested copies of such letters as might have been written\n     hence in his behalf.The note did not require any answer\n     either to me or through me, and I have heard nothing of it\n     since I handed it to Pickering."At this time the Secretary\n     of State\'s office contained the President\'s official\n     recognition of Paine\'s citizenship; but this application\n     for the papers relating to his imprisonment by a foreign\n     power received no reply, though it was evidently couched in\n     respectful terms; as the letter was open for the eye of\n     Madison, who would not have conveyed it otherwise.It is\n     incredible that Washington could have sanctioned such an\n     outrage on one he had recognized as an American citizen,\n     unless under pressure of misrepresentations.Possibly\n     Paine\'s Quaker and republican direction of his letter to\n     "George Washington, President of the United States," was\n     interpreted by his federalist ministers as an insult.It will be seen, by Madame Bonneville\'s and Jarvis\' statements\nelsewhere, that Paine lost his case against Elisha Ward, on what ground\nit is difficult to imagine.The records of the Supreme Court, at Albany,\nand the Clerk\'s office at White Plains, have been vainly searched for\nany trace of this trial.John H. Riker, son of Paine\'s counsel, has\nexamined the remaining papers of Richard Riker (many were accidentally\ndestroyed) without finding anything related to the matter.It is so\nterrible to think that with Jefferson, Clinton, and Madison at the head\nof the government, and the facts so clear, the federalist Elisha Ward\ncould vindicate his insult to Thomas Paine, that it may be hoped the\npublication of these facts will bring others to light that may put a\nbetter face on the matter.*\n\n     * Gilbert Vale relates an anecdote which suggests that a\n     reaction may have occurred in Elisha Ward\'s family: "At the\n     time of Mr.Paine\'s residence at his farm, Mr.Ward, now a\n     coffee-roaster in Gold Street, New York, and an assistant\n     alderman, was then a little boy and residing at New\n     Rochelle.He remembers the impressions his mother and some\n     religious people made on him by speaking of Tom Paine, so\n     that he concluded that Tom Paine must be a very bad and\n     brutal man.Some of his elder companions proposed going into\n     Mr.Paine\'s orchard to obtain some fruit, and he, out of\n     fear, kept at a distance behind, till he beheld, with\n     surprise, Mr.Paine come out and assist the boys in getting\n     apples, patting one on the head and caressing another, and\n     directing them where to get the best.He then advanced and\n     received his share of encouragement, and the impression this\n     kindness made on him determined him at a very early period\n     to examine his writings.His mother at first took the books\n     from him, but at a later period restored them to him,\n     observing that he was then of an age to judge for himself;\n     perhaps she had herself been gradually undeceived, both as\n     to his character and writings."Madame Bonneville may have misunderstood the procedure for which she\nhad to pay costs, as Paine\'s legatee.Whether an ultimate decision was\nreached or not, the sufficiently shameful fact remains that Thomas Paine\nwas practically disfranchised in the country to which he had rendered\nservices pronounced pre-eminent by Congress, by Washington, and by every\nsoldier and statesman of the Revolution.Paine had in New York the most formidable of enemies,--an enemy with a\nnewspaper.This was James Cheetham, of whom something has been said in\nthe preface to this work (p.In addition to what is there stated,\nit may be mentioned that Paine had observed, soon after he came to New\nYork, the shifty course of this man\'s paper, _The American Citizen_.But it was the only republican paper in New York, supported Governor\nClinton, for which it had reason, since it had the State printing,--and\nColonel Fellows advised that Cheetham should not be attacked.Cheetham\nhad been an attendant on Elihu Palmer\'s lectures, and after his\nparticipation in the dinner to Paine, his federalist opponent, the\n_Evening Post_, alluded to his being at Palmer\'s.Thereupon Cheetham\ndeclared that he had not heard Palmer for two years.In the winter\nof 1804 he casually spoke of Paine\'s "mischievous doctrines."In the\nfollowing year, when Paine wrote the defence of Jefferson\'s personal\ncharacter already alluded to, Cheetham omitted a reference in it\nto Alexander Hamilton\'s pamphlet, by which he escaped accusation of\nofficial defalcation by confessing an amorous intrigue.*\n\n     *  "I see that Cheetham has left out the part respecting\n     Hamilton and Mrs.Reynolds, but for my own part I wish it\n     had been in.Had the story never been publicly told I\n     would not have been the first to tell it; but Hamilton had\n     told it himself, and therefore it was no secret; but my\n     motive in introducing it was because it was applicable to\n     the subject I was upon, and to show the revilers of Mr.Jefferson that while they are affecting a morality of horror\n     at an unproved and unfounded story about Mr.Jefferson, they\n     had better look at home and give vent to their horror, if\n     they had any, at a real case of their own Dagon (sic) and\n     his Delilah."--Paine to Colonel Fellows, July 31, 1805.Cheetham having been wont to write of Hamilton as "the gallant of Mrs.Reynolds," Paine did not give much credit to the pretext of respect for\nthe dead, on which the suppression was justified.He was prepared to\nadmit that his allusion might be fairly suppressed, but perceived that\nthe omission was made merely to give Cheetham a chance for vaunting his\nsuperior delicacy, and casting a suspicion on Paine."Cheetham," wrote\nPaine, "might as well have put the part in, as put in the reasons for\nwhich he left it out.Those reasons leave people to suspect that the\npart suppressed related to some new discovered immorality in Hamilton\nworse than the old story."About the same time with Paine, an Irishman came to America, and, after\ntravelling about the country a good deal, established a paper in New\nYork called _The People\'s Friend_.This paper began a furious onslaught\non the French, professed to have advices that Napoleon meant to retake\nNew Orleans, and urged an offensive alliance of the United States with\nEngland against France and Spain.These articles appeared in the early\nautumn of 1806, when, as we have seen, Paine was especially beset by\npersonal worries.His denunciations, merited as\nthey were, of this assailant of France reveal the unstrung condition of\nthe old author\'s nerves.Duane, of the Philadelphia _Aurora_, recognized\nin Carpenter a man he had seen in Calcutta, where he bore the name of\nCullen.It was then found that he had on his arrival in America borne\nthe _alias_ of Mac-cullen.Paine declared that he was an "emissary"\nsent to this country by Windham, and indeed most persons were at length\nsatisfied that such was the case.Paine insisted that loyalty to our\nFrench alliance demanded Cullen\'s expulsion.His exposures of "the\nemissary Cullen" (who disappeared) were printed in a new republican\npaper in New York, _The Public Advertiser_, edited by Mr.The\ncombat drew public attention to the new paper, and Cheetham was probably\nenraged by Paines transfer of his pen to Frank.In 1807, Paine had a\nlarge following in New York, his friends being none the less influential\namong the masses because not in the fashionable world Moreover, the\nvery popular Mayor of New York, De Witt Clinton, was a hearty admirer\nof Paine.So Cheetham\'s paper suffered sadly, and he opened his guns\non Paine, declaring that in the Revolution he (Paine) "had stuck very\ncorrectly to his pen in a safe retreat," that his "Rights of Man" merely\nrepeated Locke, and so forth.He also began to denounce France and\napplaud England, which led to the belief that, having lost republican\npatronage, Cheetham was aiming to get that of England.In a "Reply to Cheetham" (August 21st), Paine met personalities in kind.Cheetham, in his rage for attacking everybody and everything that\nis not his own (for he is an ugly-tempered man, and he carries\nthe evidence of it in the vulgarity and forbiddingness of his\ncountenance--God has set a mark upon Cain), has attacked me, etc."In\nreply to further attacks, Paine printed a piece headed "Cheetham and his\nTory Paper."He said that Cheetham was discovering symptoms of being\nthe successor of Cullen, _alias_ Carpenter."Like him he is seeking to\ninvolve the United States in a quarrel with France for the benefit of\nEngland."This article caused a duel between the rival editors, Cheetham\nand Frank, which seems to have been harmless.Paine wrote a letter\nto the _Evening Post_, saying that he had entreated Frank to answer\nCheetham\'s challenge by declaring that he (Paine) had written the\narticle and was the man to be called to account.In company Paine\nmentioned an opinion expressed by the President in a letter just\nreceived.This got into the papers, and Cheetham declared that the\nPresident could not have so written, and that Paine was intoxicated\nwhen he said so.For this Paine instituted a suit against Cheetham for\nslander, but died before any trial.Paine had prevailed with his pen, but a terrible revenge was plotted\nagainst his good name.The farrier William Carver, in whose house he\nhad lived, turned Judas, and concocted with Cheetham the libels against\nPaine that have passed as history.PERSONAL TRAITS\n\nOn July 1, 1806, two young English gentlemen, Daniel and William\nConstable, arrived in New York, and for some years travelled about the\ncountry.The Diary kept by Daniel Constable has been shown me by his\nnephew, Clair J. Grece, LL.D.It contains interesting allusions to\nPaine, to whom they brought an introduction from Rickman.To the Globe, in Maiden Lane, to dine.Segar at the Globe\noffered to send for Mr.Paine, who lived only a few doors off: He seemed\na true Painite.William and I went to see Thomas Paine.When we first called he was\ntaking a nap.... Back to Mr.Paine\'s about 5 o\'clock, sat about an\nhour with him.... I meant to have had T. Paine in a carriage with me\nto-morrow, and went to inquire for one.The price was $1 per hour, but\nwhen I proposed it to T. P. he declined it on account of his health.We\nwere up by five o\'clock, and on the battery saw the cannons fired, in\ncommemoration of liberty, which had been employed by the English against\nthe sacred cause.The people seemed to enter into the spirit of the day:\nstores &c were generally shut.... In the fore part of the day I had the\nhonour of walking with T. Paine along the Broadway.The day finished\npeaceably, and we saw no scenes of quarreling or drunkenness.Evening, met T. Paine in the Broadway and walked\nwith him to his house.Called to see T. Paine, who was\nwalking about Carver\'s shop."Changed snuff-boxes with T. Paine at his lodgings.* The old\nphilosopher, in bed at 4 o\'clock afternoon, seems as talkative and well\nas when we saw him in the summer."Grece showed me Paine\'s papier-mache snuff-box, which\n     his uncle had fitted with silver plate, inscription,\n     decorative eagle, and banner of "Liberty, Equality."It is\n     kept in a jewel-box with an engraving of Paine on the lid.In a letter written jointly by the brothers to their parents, dated July\n5th, they say that Paine "begins to feel the effects of age.The print\nI left at Horley is a very strong likeness.He lives with a small family\nwho came from Lewes [Carvers] quite retired, and but little known or\nnoticed."They here also speak of "the honour of walking with our old\nfriend T. Paine in the midst of the bustle on Independence Day."There\nis no suggestion, either here or in the Diary, that these gentlemen of\nculture and position observed anything in the appearance or habits of\nPaine that diminished the pleasure of meeting him.In November they\ntravelled down the Mississippi, and on their return to New York, nine\nmonths later, they heard (July 20, 1807) foul charges against Paine\nfrom Carver."Paine has left his house, and they have had a violent\ndisagreement.Carver charges Paine with many foul vices, as debauchery,\nlying, ingratitude, and a total want of common honour in all his\nactions, says that he drinks regularly a quart of brandy per day."But\nnext day they call on Paine, in "the Bowery road," and William Constable\nwrites:\n\n"He looks better than last year.He read us an essay on national\ndefence, comparing the different expenses and powers of gunboats and\nships of war and, batteries in protecting a sea coast; and gave D. C.[Daniel Constable] a copy of his Examination of the texts of scriptures\ncalled prophecies, etc.He says\nthat this work is of too high a cut for the priests and that they will\nnot touch it."These brothers Constable met Fulton, a friend of Paine\'s just then\nexperimenting with his steam-boat on the Hudson.They also found that a\nscandal had been caused by a report brought to the British Consul that\nthirty passengers on the ship by which they (the Constables) came, had\n"the Bible bound up with the \'Age of Reason,\' and that they spoke in\nvery disrespectful terms of the mother country."Paine had left his\nfarm at New Rochelle, at which place the travellers heard stories of\nhis slovenliness, also that he was penurious, though nothing was said of\nintemperance.Inquiry among aged residents of New Rochelle has been made from time to\ntime for a great many years.J. B. Stallo, late U. S. Minister\nto Italy, told me that in early life he visited the place and saw\npersons who had known Paine, and declared that Paine resided there\nwithout fault.Staple, brother of the\ninfluential Captain Pelton, and the adoption of Paine\'s religious views\nby some of these persons caused the odium.* Paine sometimes preached at\nNew Rochelle.Burger, Pelton\'s clerk, used to drive Paine about\n     daily.Vale says:\n\n     "He [Burger] describes Mr.Paine as really abstemious, and\n     when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his\n     rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely.In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and\n     their mutual greetings were extremely hearty.Paine\n     at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless\n     of his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean\n     and well clothed.Burger describes him as familiar with\n     children and humane to animals, playing with the neighboring\n     children, and communicating a friendly pat even to a passing\n     dog."Our frontispiece shows Paine\'s dress in 1803.Cheetham publishes a correspondence purporting to have passed between\nPaine and Carver, in November, 1806, in which the former repudiates\nthe latter\'s bill for board (though paying it), saying he was badly\nand dishonestly treated in Carver\'s house, and had taken him out of his\nWill.To this a reply is printed, signed by Carver, which he certainly\nnever wrote; specimens of his composition, now before me, prove him\nhardly able to spell a word correctly or to frame a sentence.*\n\n     * In the Concord (Mass.)Public Library there is a copy of\n     Cheetham\'s book, which belonged to Carver, by whom it was\n     filled with notes.He says: "Cheetham was a hypocrate turned\n     Tory," "Paine was not Drunk when he wrote the thre pedlars\n     for me, I sold them to a gentleman, a Jew for a dollar--\n     Cheetham knew that he told a lie saying Paine was drunk--any\n     person reading Cheetham\'s life of Paine that [sic] his pen\n     was guided by prejudice that was brought on by Cheetham\'s\n     altering a peice that Paine had writen as an answer to a\n     peice that had apeared in his paper, I had careyd the peice\n     to Cheetham, the next Day the answer was printed with the\n     alteration, Paine was angry, sent me to call Cheetham I then\n     asked how he undertook to mutilate the peice, if aney thing\n     was rong he knew ware to find him & sad he never permitted a\n     printer to alter what he had wrote, that the sence of the\n     peice was spoiled--by this means their freind ship was\n     broken up through life------"   (The marginalia in this\n     volume have been copied for me with exactness by Miss E. G.\n     Crowell, of Concord.)The letter in Cheetham shows a practised hand, and was evidently written\nfor Carver by the "biographer."This ungenuineness of Carver\'s\nletter, and expressions not characteristic in that of Paine render the\ncorrespondence mythical.Although Carver passed many penitential years\nhanging about Paine celebrations, deploring the wrong he had done Paine,\nhe could not squarely repudiate the correspondence, to which Cheetham\nhad compelled him to swear in court.He used to declare that Cheetham\nhad obtained under false pretences and printed without authority letters\nwritten in anger.But thrice in his letter to Paine Carver says he means\nto publish it.Its closing words are: "There may be many grammatical\nerrours in this letter.To you I have no apologies to make; but I hope a\ncandid and impartial public will not view them \'with a critick\'s eye.\'"This is artful; besides the fling at Paine\'s faulty grammar, which\nCarver could not discover, there is a pretence to faults in his own\nletter which do not exist, but certainly would have existed had he\nwritten it The style throughout is transparently Cheethan\'s.* "A Bone to Gnaw for Grant Thorburn."By W. Carver\n     (1836).In the book at Concord the unassisted Carver writes: "The libel for\nwich [sic] he [Cheetham] was sued was contained in the letter I wrote to\nPaine."This was the libel on Madame Bonneville, Carver\'s antipathy\nto whom arose from his hopes of Paine\'s property.In reply to Paine\'s\ninformation, that he was excluded from his Will, Carver says: "I\nlikewise have to inform you, that I totally disregard the power of your\nmind and pen; for should you, by your conduct, permit this letter to\nappear in public, in vain may you attempt to print or publish any thing\nafterwards."Carver\'s letter\nis dated December 2, 1806.It was not published during Paine\'s life,\nfor the farrier hoped to get back into the Will by frightening Madame\nBonneville and other friends of Paine with the stories he meant to tell.About a year before Paine\'s death he made another blackmailing attempt.He raked up the scandalous stories published by "Oldys" concerning\nPaine\'s domestic troubles in Lewes, pretending that he knew the facts\npersonally.Carver has offered me an affidavit,"\nsays Cheetham."He stated them all to Paine in a private letter which he\nwrote to him a year before his death; to which no answer was returned.Carver showed me the letter soon after it was written."On this\nplain evidence of long conspiracy with Cheetham, and attempt to\nblackmail Paine when he was sinking in mortal illness, Carver never\nmade any comment.When Paine was known to be near his end Carver made\nan effort at conciliation."I think it a pity," he wrote, "that you\nor myself should depart this life with envy in our hearts against each\nother--and I firmly believe that no difference would have taken place\nbetween us, had not some of your pretended friends endeavored to have\ncaused a separation of friendship between us."But abjectness was not\nmore effectual than blackmail.The property went to the Bonnevilles,\nand Carver, who had flattered Paine\'s "great mind," in the letter\njust quoted, proceeded to write a mean one about the dead author for\nCheetham\'s projected biography.He did not, however, expect Cheetham to\npublish his slanderous letter about Paine and Madame Bonneville, which\nhe meant merely for extortion; nor could Cheetham have got the letter\nhad he not written it.All of Cheetham\'s libels on Paine\'s life in New\nYork are amplifications of Carver\'s insinuations.In describing Cheetham\nas "an abominable liar," Carver passes sentence on himself.On this\nblackmailer, this confessed libeller, rest originally and fundamentally\nthe charges relating to Paine\'s last years.It has already been stated that Paine boarded for a time in the Bayeaux\nmansion.In 1891 I\nvisited, at New Rochelle, Mr.Albert Badeau, son of the lady last named,\nfinding him, as I hope he still is, in good health and memory.Seated\nin the arm-chair given him by his mother, as that in which Paine used\nto sit by their fireside, I took down for publication some words of\nhis."My mother would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr.She declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a\nperfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,\nnever intemperate in eating or drinking.My mother declared that my\ngrandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr.I never remember to have seen my mother angry except when she\nheard such calumnies of Mr.Paine, when she would almost insult those\nwho uttered them.My mother and grandmother were very religious, members\nof the Episcopal Church."Albert Badeau\'s religious opinions\nare I do not know, but no one acquainted with that venerable gentleman\ncould for an instant doubt his exactness and truthfulness.It\ncertainly was not until some years after his return to America that any\nslovenliness could be observed about Paine, and the contrary was often\nremarked in former times.* After he had come to New York, and was\nneglected by the pious ladies and gentlemen with whom he had once\nassociated, he neglected his personal appearance."Let those dress who\nneed it," he said to a friend.* "He dined at my table," said Aaron Burr."I always\n     considered Mr.Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and\n     a good-natured and intelligent man; decidedly temperate,\n     with a proper regard for his personal appearance, whenever I\n     have seen him."says Joel Barlow, "he was generally very\n     cleanly, though careless, and wore his hair queued with side\n     curls, and powdered, like a gentleman of the old French\n     School.His manners were easy and gracious, his knowledge\n     universal."Paine was prodigal of snuff, but used tobacco in no other form.He had\naversion to profanity, and never told or listened to indecent anecdotes.With regard to the charges of excessive drinking made against Paine, I\nhave sifted a vast mass of contrarious testimonies, and arrived at the\nfollowing conclusions.In earlier life Paine drank spirits, as was the\ncustom in England and America; and he unfortunately selected brandy,\nwhich causes alcoholic indigestion, and may have partly produced the\noft-quoted witness against him--his somewhat red nose.His nose was\nprominent, and began to be red when he was fifty-five.That was just\nafter he had been dining a good deal with rich people in England, and\nat public dinners.During his early life in England (1737--1774) no\ninstance of excess was known, and Paine expressly pointed the Excise\nOffice to his record."No complaint of the least dishonesty or\nintemperance has ever appeared against me."His career in America\n(1774-1787) was free from any suspicion of intemperance.John Hall\'s\ndaily diary while working with Paine for months is minute, mentioning\neverything, but in no case is a word said of Paine\'s drinking.Paine\'s enemy, Chalmers ("Oldys"), raked up in 1791 every\ncharge he could against Paine, but intemperance is not included.Paine\ntold Rickman that in Paris, when borne down by public and private\naffliction, he had been driven to excess.That period I have identified\non a former page (ii., p.59) as a few weeks in 1793, when his dearest\nfriends were on their way to the guillotine, whither he daily expected\nto follow them.After that Paine abstained altogether from spirits, and\ndrank wine in moderation.Lovett, who kept the City Hotel, New York,\nwhere Paine stopped in 1803 and 1804 for some weeks, wrote a note to\nCaleb Bingham, of Boston, in which he says that Paine drank less\nthan any of his boarders.Gilbert Vale, in preparing his biography,\nquestioned D. Burger, the clerk of Pelton\'s store at New Rochelle, and\nfound that Paine\'s liquor supply while there was one quart of rum per\nweek.He also questioned Jarvis, the\nartist, in whose house Paine resided in New York (Church Street) five\nmonths, who declared that what Cheetham had reported about Paine and\nhimself was entirely false.Paine, he said, "did not and could not drink\nmuch."In July, 1809, just after Paine\'s death, Cheetham wrote\nBarlow for information concerning Paine, "useful in illustrating his\ncharacter," and said: "He was a great drunkard here, and Mr.M., a\nmerchant of this city, who lived with him when he was arrested by order\nof Robespierre, tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened."Barlow, recently returned from Europe, was living just out of\nWashington; he could know nothing of Cheetham\'s treachery, and fell into\nhis trap; he refuted the story of "Mr.M.," of course, but took it for\ngranted that a supposed republican editor would tell the truth about\nPaine in New York, and wrote of the dead author as having "a mind,\nthough strong enough to bear him up and to rise elastic under the\nheaviest hand of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt of his\nformer friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that had\nreceived his first and greatest services; a mind incapable of looking\ndown with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their\nimitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from\ntheir society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for\nconsolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, etc."!Barlow, misled as he\nwas, well knew Paine\'s nature, and that if he drank to excess it was not\nfrom appetite, but because of ingratitude and wrong.The man was not a\nstock or a stone.If any can find satisfaction in the belief that Paine\nfound no Christian in America so merciful as rum, they may perhaps\ndiscover some grounds for it in a brief period of his sixty-ninth year.While living in the house of Carver, Paine was seized with an illness\nthat threatened to be mortal, and from which he never fully recovered.It is probable that he was kept alive for a time by spirits during the\nterrible time, but this ceased when in the latter part of 1806 he left\nCarver\'s to live with Jarvis.In the spring of 1808 he resided in the\nhouse of Mr.Hitt, a baker, in Broome Street, and there remained\nten months.Hitt reports that Paine\'s weekly supply then--his\nseventy-second year, and his last--was three quarts of rum per week.* Todd\'s "Joel Barlow," p.was one\n     Murray, an English speculator in France, where he never\n     resided with Paine at all.After Paine had left Carver\'s he became acquainted with more people.The late Judge Tabor\'s recollections have been sent me by his son, Mr."I was an associate editor of the _New York Beacon_ with Col.John\nFellows, then (1836) advanced in years, but retaining all the vigor and\nfire of his manhood.He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable companion,\nand had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe\nand John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a responsible office.One of his productions was dedicated, by permission, to [J.Adams,\nand was republished and favorably received in England.Fellows\nwas the soul of honor and inflexible in his adherence to truth.He was\nintimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after returning to\nthis country, and boarded for a year in the same house with him."I also was acquainted with Judge Hertell, of New York City, a man of\nwealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both\nin the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.Fellows, he was an author, and a man of unblemished life and\nirreproachable character."These men assured me of their own knowledge derived from constant\npersonal intercourse during the last seven years of Paine\'s life, that\nhe never kept any company but what was entirely respectable, and that\nall accusations of drunkenness were grossly untrue.They saw him under\nall circumstances and _knew_ that he was never intoxicated.Nay, more,\nthey said, for that day, he was even abstemious.That was a drinking age\nand Paine, like Jefferson, could \'bear but little spirit,\' so that he\nwas constitutionally temperate."Cheetham refers to William Carver and the portrait painter Jarvis.I\nvisited Carver, in company with Col.Fellows, and naturally conversed\nwith the old man about Paine.He said that the allegation that Paine was\na drunkard was altogether without foundation.In speaking of his letter\nto Paine which Cheetham published, Carver said that he was angry when\nhe wrote it and that he wrote unwisely, as angry men generally do;\nthat Cheetham obtained the letter under false pretenses and printed it\nwithout authority.Fellows and Judge Hertell visited Paine throughout the whole\ncourse of his last illness.They repeatedly conversed with him\non religious topics and they declared that he died serenely,\nphilosophically and resignedly.This information I had directly from\ntheir own lips, and their characters were so spotless, and their\nintegrity so unquestioned, that more reliable testimony it would be\nimpossible to give."During Paine\'s life the world heard no hint of sexual immorality\nconnected with him, but after his death Cheetham published the\nfollowing: "Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in\nwhose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three\nsons._Thomas_ has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine,"\nMadame Bonneville promptly sued Cheetham for slander.Cheetham had\nbetrayed his "pal," Carver, by printing the letter concocted to\nblackmail Paine, for whose composition the farrier no doubt supposed\nhe had paid the editor with stories borrowed from "Oldys," or not\nactionable.Cheetham probably recognized, when he saw Madame Bonneville\nin court, that he too had been deceived, and that any illicit relation\nbetween the accused lady and Paine, thirty years her senior, was\npreposterous.Cheetham\'s lawyer (Griffin) insinuated terrible things\nthat his witnesses were to prove, but they all dissolved into Carver.Ryder, with whom Paine had boarded, admitted trying to make Paine\nsmile by saying Thomas was like him, but vehemently repudiated the\nslander.She never saw but\ndecency with Mrs.She never staid there but one night, when\nPaine was very sick."Dean was summoned to support one of Carver\'s\nlies that Madame Bonneville tried to cheat Paine, but denied the whole\nstory (which has unfortunately been credited by Vale and other writers).Foster, who had a claim against Paine\'s estate for tuition\nof the Bonnevilles, was summoned.Bonneville," he testified,\n"might possibly have said as much as that but for Paine she would not\nhave come here, and that he was under special obligations to provide for\nher children."A Westchester witness, Peter Underbill, testified that\n"he one day told Mrs.Bonneville that her child resembled Paine,\nand Mrs.Bonneville said it was Paine\'s child."But, apart from the\nintrinsic incredibility of this statement (unless she meant "god-son"),\nUnderbill\'s character broke down under the testimony of his neighbors,\nJudge Sommerville and Captain Pelton.Cheetham had thus no dependence\nbut Carver, who actually tried to support his slanders from the dead\nlips of Paine!But in doing so he ruined Cheetham\'s case by saying that\nPaine told him Madame Bonneville was never the wife of M. Bonneville;\nthe charge being that she was seduced from her husband.It was extorted\nfrom Carver that Madame Bonneville, having seen his scurrilous letter to\nPaine, threatened to prosecute him; also that he had taken his wife to\nvisit Madame Bonneville.Then it became plain to Carver that Cheetham\'s\ncase was lost, and he deserted it on the witness-stand; declaring that\n"he had never seen the slightest indication of any meretricious or\nillicit commerce between Paine and Mrs.Bonneville, that they never were\nalone together, and that all the three children were alike the objects\nof Paine\'s care."Counsellor Sampson (no friend to Paine) perceived that\nPaine\'s Will was at the bottom of the business."That is the key to this\nmysterious league of apostolic slanderers, mortified expectants and\ndisappointed speculators."Sampson\'s invective was terrific; Cheetham\nrose and claimed protection of the court, hinting at a duel.Sampson\ntook a pinch of snuff, and pointing his finger at the defendant, said:\n\n"If he complains of personalities, he who is hardened in every gross\nabuse, he who lives reviling and reviled, who might construct himself\na monument with no other materials but those records to which he is a\nparty, and in which he stands enrolled as an offender*: if he cannot sit\nstill to hear his accusation, but calls for the protection of the court\nagainst a counsel whose duty it is to make his crimes appear, how does\nshe deserve protection, whom he has driven to the sad necessity of\ncoming here to vindicate her honor, from those personalities he has\nlavished on her?"* Cheetham was at the moment a defendant in  nine or ten\n     cases for libel.The editor of Counsellor Sampson\'s speech says that the jury "although\ncomposed of men of different political sentiments, returned in a few\nminutes a verdict of guilty."It is added:\n\n"The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive\nhis sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous\npublication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and\nimposed no other punishment on the libeller than the payment of $150,\nwith a direction that the costs be taken out of it.It is fit to remark,\nlest foreigners who are unacquainted with our political condition should\nreceive erroneous impressions, that Mr.Recorder Hoffman does not belong\nto the Republican party in America, but has been elevated to office\nby men in hostility to it, who obtained a temporary ascendency in the\ncouncils of state."*\n\n     * "Speech of Counsellor Sampson; with an Introduction to\n     the Trial of James Cheetham, Esq., for a libel on Margaret\n     Brazier Bonneville, in his Memoirs of Thomas Paine.Philadelphia: Printed by John Sweeny, No-357 Arch Street,\n     1810."I am indebted for the use of this rare pamphlet and\n     for other information, to the industrious collector of\n     causes celebres, Mr.E. B. Wynn, of Watertown, N. Y.\n\nMadame Bonneville had in court eminent witnesses to her\ncharacter,--Thomas Addis Emmet, Fulton, Jarvis, and ladies whose\nchildren she had taught French.Yet the scandal was too tempting an\nillustration of the "Age of Reason" to disappear with Cheetham\'s defeat.Americans in their peaceful habitations were easily made suspicious of a\nFrench woman who had left her husband in Paris and followed Paine; they\ncould little realize the complications into which ten tempestuous years\nhad thrown thousands of families in France, and how such poor radicals\nas the Bonnevilles had to live as they could.The scandal branched into\nvariants.Twenty-five years later pious Grant Thorburn promulgated that\nPaine had run off from Paris with the wife of a tailor named Palmer."Paine made no scruples of living with this woman openly."Elihu\nPalmer, in her penury, was employed by Paine to attend to his rooms,\netc, during a few months of illness.)As to Madame Bonneville, whose\nname Grant Thorburn seems not to have heard, she was turned into a\nromantic figure.Thorburn says that Paine escaped the guillotine by the\nexecution of another man in his place."The man who suffered death for Paine, left a widow, with two young\nchildren in poor circumstances.Paine brought them all to this country,\nsupported them while he lived, and, it is said, left most of his\nproperty to them when he died.The widow and children lived in\napartments up town by themselves.I believe\nhis conduct was disinterested and honorable to the widow.She appeared\nto be about thirty years of age, and was far from being handsome."*\n\n     * "Forty Years\' Residence in America."Grant Thorburn was afterwards led to doubt whether this woman was\nthe widow of the man guillotined, but declares that when "Paine first\nbrought her out, he and his friends passed her off as such."As a myth\nof the time (1834), and an indication that Paine\'s generosity to\nthe Bonneville family was well known in New York, the story is worth\nquoting.But the Bonnevilles never escaped from the scandal.Long years\nafterward, when the late Gen.Louis, it\nwas whispered about that he was the natural son of Thomas Paine, though\nhe was born before Paine ever met Madame Bonneville.Of course it\nhas gone into the religious encyclopaedias.The best of them, that of\nMcClintock and Strong, says: "One of the women he supported [in France]\nfollowed him to this country."After the fall of Napoleon, Nicholas\nBonneville, relieved of his surveillance, hastened to New York, where\nhe and his family were reunited, and enjoyed the happiness provided by\nPaine\'s self-sacrificing economy.The present writer, having perused some thou-sands of documents\nconcerning Paine, is convinced that no charge of sensuality could have\nbeen brought against him by any one acquainted with the facts, except\nout of malice.Had Paine held, or practised, any latitudinarian theory\nof sexual liberty, it would be recorded here, and his reasons for\nthe same given.And as to his sacrificing the happiness of\na home to his own pleasure, nothing could be more inconceivable.Above all, Paine was a profoundly religious man,--one of the few in our\nrevolutionary era of whom it can be said that his delight was in the law\nof his Lord, and in that law did he meditate day and night Consequently,\nhe could not escape the immemorial fate of the great believers, to be\npersecuted for unbelief--by unbelievers.DEATH AND RESURRECTION\n\nThe blow that Paine received by the refusal of his vote at New Rochelle\nwas heavy.Elisha Ward, a Tory in the Revolution, had dexterously\ngained power enough to give his old patrons a good revenge on the first\nadvocate of independence.The blow came at a time when his means were\nlow, and Paine resolved to apply to Congress for payment of an old debt.The response would at once relieve him, and overwhelm those who were\ninsulting him in New York.This led to a further humiliation, and one or\ntwo letters to Congress, of which Paine\'s enemies did not fail to make\nthe most.* Paine had always felt that Congress was in his debt for\n     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine\n     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should\n     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of\n     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of\n     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy\n     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was\n     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent\n     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as\n     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of\n     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,\n     he had but two louis d\'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to\n     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my\n     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,\n     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On\n     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000\n     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an\n     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the\n     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton\n     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received\n     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine\n     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the\n     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of\n     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on\n     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of\n     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show\n     Paine\'s connection with the mission.The old author was\n     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his\n     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing\n     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,\n     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the\n     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many\n     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous\nthat Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that\nsome recognition of Paine\'s former services, by those who should not\nhave forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While\nthey were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,\n"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to\nsecure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable\nlodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for\nhe was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is\na well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in\nearly life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if\nfacing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for\nsome time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm\nhe meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at\nhis widow\'s appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that\nhe appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious\nfor himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on\nthis point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine\'s was: written to Jefferson,\nJuly 8, 1808:\n\n"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult\nto see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing\nthe orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the\ncommerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission\nto such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the\nContinent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and\nAmerica.\'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they\nhave-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and\ninstead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose\nthey would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it\nwithout too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo\nlaw empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be\nsatisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the\nidea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose\nthe President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british\nMinistry that the United States would negociate with France for\nrescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would\nrescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States\nwould recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a\ndistance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are\nthere any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only\npower that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want\nto add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the\ncontinent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it\nany thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the\nMilan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for\nAmerican intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the\n<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free\n<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation\nbetween France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll\nalong the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,\nhe may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the\nfederation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house\nwas on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might\nbe pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt\nto wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal\nFaction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by\nabusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation\nact that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States\nhave flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But\nit is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances\nof the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present\nwar.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The\nyear passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that\nfrom the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly\nenjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy\nWillett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations\nwith Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an\nimportant figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were\nfruitful.Towards the latter part of\nJanuary, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed\nhis Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st\nthe Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while\nrecording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the\nUnited States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot\nbe doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and\nattached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some\nfever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack\nto Paine\'s having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was\nprescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards\nthe end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied\nby No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under\nthe same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner\nof Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu\nPalmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no\nstreet being then cut) was given up to Paine.*\n\n     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,\n     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,\n     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being\n     rendered April 6, 1864.Reports of neglect of Paine by Madame Bonneville have been credited by\nsome, but are unfounded She gave all the time she could to the sufferer,\nand did her best for him.Willett Hicks sometimes called, and his\ndaughter (afterwards Mrs.Cheese-man) used to take Paine delicacies.The\nonly procurable nurse was a woman named Hedden, who combined piety and\nartfulness.Paine\'s physician was the most distinguished in New York,\nDr.Romaine, but nurse Hedden managed to get into the house one\nDr.Manly, who turned out to be Cheetham\'s spy.Manly afterwards\ncontributed to Cheetham\'s book a lying letter, in which he claimed\nto have been Paine\'s physician.It will be seen, however, by Madame\nBonneville\'s narrative to Cobbett, that Paine was under the care of\nhis friend.As Manly, assuming that he called as many did,\nnever saw Paine alone, he was unable to assert that Paine recanted, but\nhe converted the exclamations of the sufferer into prayers to Christ.*\n\n     * Another claimant to have been Paine\'s physician has been\n     cited.In 1876 (N. Y, Observer) Feb.Wickham\n     reported from a late Dr.Matson Smith, of New Rochelle, that\n     he had been Paine\'s physician, and witnessed his\n     drunkenness.Unfortunately for Wickham he makes Smith say it\n     was on his farm where Paine "spent his latter days."Paine\n     was not on his farm for two years before his death.Smith\n     could never have attended Paine unless in 1803, when he had\n     a slight trouble with his hands,--the only illness he ever\n     had at New Rochelle,--while the guest of a neighbor, who\n     attests his sobriety.Smith is\n     living, Mr.Albert Willcox, who writes me his recollection\n     of what Smith told him of Paine.Neither drunkenness, nor\n     any item of Wickham\'s report is mentioned.He said Paine\n     was afraid of death, but could only have heard it.The god of wrath who ruled in New York a hundred years, through the\nministerial prerogatives, was guarded by a Cerberean legend.The\nthree alternatives of the heretic were, recantation, special judgment,\nterrible death.Before Paine\'s arrival in America, the excitement on\nhis approach had tempted a canny Scot, Donald Fraser, to write an\nanticipated "Recantation" for him, the title-page being cunningly\ndevised so as to imply that there had been an actual recantation.On his\narrival in New York, Paine found it necessary to call Fraser to account,\nThe Scotchman pleaded that he had vainly tried to earn a living as\nfencing-master, preacher, and school-teacher, but had got eighty dollars\nfor writing the "Recantation."Paine said: "I am glad you found the\nexpedient a successful shift for your needy family; but write no more\nconcerning Thomas Paine.I am satisfied with your acknowledgment--try\nsomething more worthy of a man."*\n\n     * Dr.Francis\' "Old New York," p.The second mouth of Cerberus was noisy throughout the land; revivalists\nwere describing in New Jersey how some "infidel" had been struck blind\nin Virginia, and in Virginia how one was struck dumb in New Jersey.But here was the very head and front of what they called "infidelity,"\nThomas Paine, who ought to have gathered in his side a sheaf of\nthunderbolts, preserved by more marvellous "providences" than any\nsectarian saint.Out of one hundred and sixty carried to the guillotine\nfrom his prison, he alone was saved, by the accident of a chalk mark\naffixed to the wrong side of his cell door.On two ships he prepared\nto return to America, but was prevented; one sank at sea, the other was\nsearched by the British for him particularly.And at the very moment\nwhen New Rochelle disciples were calling down fire on his head,\nChristopher Dederick tried vainly to answer the imprecation; within a\nfew feet of Paine, his gun only shattered the window at which the author\nsat."Providence must be as bad as Thomas Paine," wrote the old deist.This amounted to a sort of contest like that of old between the\nprophets of Baal and those of Jehovah.The deists were crying to their\nantagonists: "Perchance he sleepeth."If Paine\nwas spared, what heretic need tremble?But he reached his threescore\nyears and ten in comfort; and the placard of Satan flying off with him\nrepresented a last hope.Skepticism and rationalism were not understood by pious people a hundred\nyears ago.Renan thinks\nhe will have his legend in France modelled after Judas.But no educated\nChristian conceives of a recantation or extraordinary death-bed for a\nDarwin, a Parker, an Emerson.Brad-laugh had some fear that\nhe might be a posthumous victim of the "infidel\'s legend."In 1875, when\nhe was ill in St Luke\'s Hospital, New York, he desired me to question\nthe physicians and nurses, that I might, if necessary, testify to his\nfearlessness and fidelity to his views in the presence of death.But he\nhas died without the "legend," whose decline dates from Paine\'s case;\nthat was its crucial challenge.The whole nation had recently been thrown into a wild excitement by\nthe fall of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Hamilton\'s\nworld-liness had been notorious, but the clergymen (Bishop Moore and the\nPresbyterian John Mason) reported his dying words of unctuous piety and\northodoxy.John Mason, Paine said:\n\n"Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr.Moore of the\nEpiscopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of\nsome importance, reduced General Hamilton\'s character to that of a\nfeeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from\na priest.Which of you was first applied to for this purpose is a matter\nof no consequence.The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in\nGod, that leads a just and moral life, and endeavors to do good, does\nnot trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes, nor\npermit priests to trouble themselves about him."The words were widely commented on, and both sides looked forward,\nalmost as if to a prize-fight, to the hour when the man who had unmade\nthrones, whether in earth or heaven, must face the King of Terrors.Since Michael and Satan had their legendary combat for the body of\nMoses, there was nothing like it.In view of the pious raids on Paine\'s\ndeath-bed, freethinkers have not been quite fair.To my own mind, some\nrespect is due to those humble fanatics, who really believed that Paine\nwas approaching eternal fires, and had a frantic desire to save him.*\n\n     * Nor should it be forgotten that several liberal\n     Christians, like Hicks, were friendly towards Paine at the\n     close of his life, whereas his most malignant enemies were\n     of his own "Painite" household, Carver and Cheetham.William Erving tells me that he remembers an English\n     clergyman in New York, named Cunningham, who used to visit\n     his (Erving\'s) father.He heard him say that Paine and he\n     were friends; and that "the whole fault was that people\n     hectored Paine, and made him say things he would never say\n     to those who treated him as a gentleman."Paine had no fear of death; Madame Bonneville\'s narrative shows that his\nfear was rather of living too long.But he had some such fear as that of\nVoltaire when entering his house at Fernay after it began to lighten.He was not afraid of the lightning, he said, but of what the neighboring\npriest would make of it should he be struck.Paine had some reason to\nfear that the zealots who had placarded the devil flying away with him\nmight fulfil their prediction by body-snatching.His unwillingness to be\nleft alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to\nget a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without\nwitnesses.While living with Jarvis, two years\nbefore, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic\nconvictions to the last.Jarvis merrily proposed that he should make a\nsensation by a mock recantation, but the author said, "Tom Paine never\ntold a lie."When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly\nreaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr.Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.* The nurse\nHedden, if the Catholic Bishop of Boston (Fenwick) remembered accurately\nthirty-seven years later, must have conspired to get him into the\npatient\'s room, from which, of course, he was stormily expelled.But the\nBishop\'s story is so like a pious novelette that, in the absence of\nany mention of his visit by Madame Bonneville, herself a Catholic, one\ncannot be sure that the interview he waited so long to report did not\ntake place in some slumberous episcopal chamber in Boston.**\n\n     * Sec the certificate of Nixon and Pelton to Cobbett (Vale,\n     p.** Bishop Fenwick\'s narrative (U. S. Catholic Magazine,\n     1846) is quoted in the N. Y. Observer\\ September 27, 1877.(Extremes become friends when a freethinker is to be\n     crucified.)It was rumored that Paine\'s adherents were keeping him under the\ninfluence of liquor in order that he might not recant,--so convinced,\nat heart, or enamoured of Calvinism was this martyr of Theism, who\nhad published his "Age of Reason" from the prison where he awaited the\nguillotine.*\n\n     * Engineer Randel (orthodox), in his topographical report to\n     the Clerk of the City Council (1864), mentions that the\n     "very worthy mechanic," Amasa Wordsworth, who saw Paine\n     daily, told him "there was no truth in such report, and that\n     Thomas Paine had declined saying anything on that subject\n     [religion]."Francis, "clung to his\n     infidelity to the last moment of his natural life."Francis (orthodox) heard that Paine yielded to King Alcohol,\n     but says Cheetham wrote with "settled malignity," and\n     suspects "sinister motives" in his "strictures on the fruits\n     of unbelief in the degradation of the wretched Paine."Of what his principles had cost him Paine had near his end a reminder\nthat cut him to the heart.Albert Gallatin had remained his friend, but\nhis connections, the Fews and Nicholsons, had ignored the author they\nonce idolized.The woman for whom he had the deepest affection, in\nAmerica, had been Kitty Nicholson, now Mrs.Henry Adams, in his\nbiography of Gallatin, says: "When confined to his bed with his last\nillness he [Paine] sent for Mrs.Few, who came to see him, and when they\nparted she spoke some words of comfort and religious hope.Poor Paine\nonly turned his face to the wall, and kept silence."According to Rick-man, Sherwin, and Vale, Mr.Few came of their own accord, and "Mrs.Few expressed a wish to\nrenew their former friendship."Paine said to her, "very impressively,\n\'You have neglected me, and I beg that you will leave the room.\'Few went into the garden and wept bitterly."I doubt this tradition\nalso, but it was cruelly tantalizing for his early friend, after\nignoring him six years, to return with Death.If, amid tortures of this kind, the annoyance of fanatics and the\n"Painites" who came to watch them, and the paroxysms of pain, the\nsufferer found relief in stimulants, the present writer can only reflect\nwith satisfaction that such resource existed.For some time no food\nwould stay on his stomach.In such weakness and helplessness he was for\na week or so almost as miserable as the Christian spies could desire,\nand his truest friends were not sorrowful when the peace of death\napproached.After the years in which the stories of Paine\'s wretched\nend have been accumulating, now appears the testimony of the Catholic\nlady,--persons who remember Madame Bonneville assure me that she was a\nperfect lady,--that Paine\'s mind was active to the last, that shortly\nbefore death he made a humorous retort to Dr.Romaine, that he died\nafter a tranquil night.Paine died at eight o\'clock on the morning of June 8, 1809.Shortly\nbefore, two clergymen had invaded his room, and so soon as they spoke\nabout his opinions Paine said: "Let me alone; good morning!"Madame\nBonneville asked if he was satisfied with the treatment he had received\nin her house, and he said "Oh yes."These were the last words of Thomas\nPaine.On June 10th Paine\'s friends assembled to look on his face for the last\ntime.Madame Bonneville took a rose from her breast and laid it on that\nof her dead benefactor.His adherents were busy men, and mostly poor;\nthey could not undertake the then difficult journey (nearly twenty-five\nmiles) to the grave beyond New Rochelle.Of the _cortege_ that followed\nPaine a contemptuous account was printed (Aug.7th) in the London\nPacket:\n\n"Extract of a letter dated June 20th, Philadelphia, written by a\ngentleman lately returned from a tour: \'On my return from my journey,\nwhen I arrived near Harlem, on York island, I met the funeral of Tom\nPaine on the road.The followers were\ntwo <DW64>s, the next a carriage with six drunken Irishmen, then a\nriding chair with two men in it, one of whom was asleep, and then an\nIrish Quaker on horseback.I stopped my sulkey to ask the Quaker what\nfuneral it was; he said it was Paine, and that his friends as well as\nhis enemies were all glad that he was gone, for he had tired his friends\nout by his intemperance and frailties.I told him that Paine had done\na great deal of mischief in the world, and that, if there was any\npurgatory, he certainly would have a good share of it before the devil\nwould let him go.The Quaker replied, he would sooner take his chance\nwith Paine than any man in New York, on that score.He then put his\nhorse on a trot, and left me.\'"The funeral was going to West Chester; one of the vehicles contained\nMadame Bonneville and her children; and the Quaker was not an Irishman.I have ascertained that a Quaker did follow Paine, and that it was\nWillett Hicks.Hicks, who has left us his testimony that Paine was "a\ngood man, and an honest man," may have said that Paine\'s friends were\nglad that he was gone, for it was only humane to so feel, but all\nsaid about "intemperance and frailties" is doubtless a gloss of the\ncorrespondent, like the "drunken Irishmen" substituted for Madame\nBonneville and her family.Could the gentleman of the sulky have appreciated the historic dignity\nof that little _cortege_ he would have turned his horse\'s head and\nfollowed it.Those two <DW64>s, travelling twenty-five miles on foot,\nrepresented the homage of a race for whose deliverance Paine had pleaded\nfrom his first essay written in America to his recent entreaty for\nthe President\'s intervention in behalf of the slaughtered <DW64>s of\nDomingo.* One of those vehicles bore the wife of an oppressed French\nauthor, and her sons, one of whom was to do gallant service to this\ncountry in the War of 1812, the other to explore the unknown West.Behind the Quaker preacher, who would rather take his chance in the next\nworld with Paine than with any man in New York, was following invisibly\nanother of his family and name, who presently built up Hicksite\nQuakerism, the real monument of Paine, to whom unfriendly Friends\nrefused a grave.* "On the last day men shall wear On their heads the dust,\n     As ensign and as ornament Of their lowly trust."--Hafis.The grand people of America were not there, the clergy were not there;\nbut beside the <DW64>s stood the Quaker preacher and the French Catholic\nwoman.Madame Bonneville placed her son Benjamin--afterwards General in\nthe United States army--at one end of the grave, and standing herself at\nthe other end, cried, as the earth fell on the coffin: "Oh, Mr.Paine,\nmy son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I for\nFrance!"No sooner was Paine dead than the ghoul sat gloating upon him.I found\nin the Rush papers a letter from Cheetham (July 31st) to Benjamin Rush:\n"Since Mr.Paine\'s arrival in this city from Washington, when on his way\nyou very properly avoided him, his life, keeping the lowest company,\nhas been an uninterrupted scene of filth, vulgarity, and drunkenness.As\nto the reports, that on his deathbed he had something like compunctious\nvisitings of conscience with regard to his deistical writings and\nopinions, they are altogether groundless.He resisted very angrily, and\nwith a sort of triumphant and obstinate pride, all attempts to draw him\nfrom those doctrines.Much as you must have seen in the course of your\nprofessional practice of everything that is offensive in the poorest\nand most depraved of the species, perhaps you have met with nothing\nexcelling the miserable condition of Mr.It may indeed be said that he was totally neglected and\nforgotten.Bournville (sic) a woman, I cannot say a Lady, whom\nhe brought with him from Paris, the wife of a Parisian of that name,\nseemed desirous of hastening his death.He died at Greenwich, in a small\nroom he had hired in a very obscure house.He was hurried to his grave\nwith hardly an attending person.An ill-natured epitaph, written on him\nin 1796, when it was supposed he was dead, incorrectly describes the\nlatter end of his life.He\n\n     "Blasphemes the Almighty, lives in filth like a hog,\n     Is abandoned in death and interr\'d like a dog."The object of this letter was to obtain from Rush, for publication, some\nabuse of Paine; but the answer honored Paine, save for his heresy, and\nis quoted by freethinkers as a tribute.Within a year the grave opened for Cheetham also, and he sank into it\nbranded by the law as the slanderer of a woman\'s honor, and scourged by\nthe community as a traitor in public life.The day of Paine\'s death was a day of judgment.He had not been struck\nblind or dumb; Satan had not carried him off; he had lived beyond\nhis threescore years and ten and died peacefully in his bed.The\nself-appointed messengers of Zeus had managed to vex this Prometheus who\nbrought fire to men, but could not persuade him to whine for mercy,\nnor did the predicted thunderbolts come.This immunity of Thomas Paine\nbrought the deity of dogma into a dilemma.It could be explained only\non the the theory of an apology made and accepted by the said deity.Plainly there had to be a recantation somewhere.Either Paine had to\nrecant or Dogma had to recant.The excitement was particularly strong among the Quakers, who regarded\nPaine as an apostate Quaker, and perhaps felt compromised by his desire\nto be buried among them.Willett Hicks told Gilbert Vale that he had\nbeen beset by pleading questions."Did thee never hear him call on\nChrist?""As for money," said Hicks, "I could have had any sum."There\nwas found, later on, a Quakeress, formerly a servant in the family of\nWillett Hicks, not proof against such temptations.She pretended that\nshe was sent to carry some delicacy to Paine, and heard him cry "Lord\nJesus have mercy upon me"; she also heard him declare "if the Devil has\never had any agency in any work he has had it in my writing that book\n[the \'Age of Reason\']."* Few souls are now so belated as to credit such\nstories; but my readers may form some conception of the mental condition\nof the community in which Paine died from the fact that such absurdities\nwere printed, believed, spread through the world.The Quaker servant\nbecame a heroine, as the one divinely appointed witness of Tom Paine\'s\nrecantation.* "Life and Gospel Labors of Stephen Grellet."This\n     "valuable young Friend," as Stephen Grellet calls her, had\n     married a Quaker named Hinsdale.Grellet, a native of\n     France, convert from Voltaire, led the anti-Hicksites, and\n     was led by his partisanship to declare that Elias promised\n     him to suppress his opinions!The cant of the time was that\n     "deism might do to live by but not to die by."But it had\n     been announced in Paine\'s obituaries that "some days\n     previous to his demise he had an interview with some Quaker\n     gentlemen on the subject [of burial in their graveyard] but\n     as he declined a renunciation of his deistical opinions his\n     anxious wishes were not complied with."But ten years later,\n     when Hicks\'s deism was spreading, death-bed terrors seemed\n     desirable, and Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale, formerly Grellet\'s\n     servant also, came forward to testify that the recantation\n     refused by Paine to the "Quaker gentlemen," even for a much\n     desired end, had been previously confided to her for no\n     object at all!The story was published by one Charles\n     Collins, a Quaker, who afterwards admitted to Gilbert Vale\n     his doubts of its truth, adding "some of our friends believe\n     she indulges in opiates."But in the end it was that same Mary that hastened the resurrection\nof Thomas Paine.The controversy as to whether Mary was or was not a\ncalumniator; whether orthodoxy was so irresistible that Paine must needs\nsurrender at last to a servant-girl who told him she had thrown his book\ninto the fire; whether she was to be believed against her employer, who\ndeclared she never saw Paine at all; all this kept Paine alive.Such boiling up from the abysses, of vulgar credulity, grotesque\nsuperstition, such commanding illustrations of the Age of Unreason,\ndisgusted thoughtful Christians.*\n\n     * The excitement of the time was well illustrated in a\n     notable caricature by the brilliant artist John Wesley\n     Jarvis.Paine is seen dead, his pillow "Common Sense," his\n     hand holding a manuscript, "A rap on the knuckles for John\n     Mason."On his arm is the label, "Answer to Bishop Watson."Under him is written: "A man who devoted his whole life to\n     the attainment of two objects--rights of man and freedom of\n     conscience--had his vote denied when living, and was denied\n     a grave when dead!"The Catholic Father O\'Brian (a\n     notorious drunkard), with very red nose, kneels over Paine,\n     exclaiming, "Oh you ugly drunken beast!"John\n     Mason (Presbyterian) stamps on Paine, exclaiming, "Ah, Tom!thou \'t get thy frying in hell; they \'ll roast thee\n     like a herring."They \'ll put thee in the furnace hot,\n     And on thee bar the door:\n     How the devils all will laugh\n     To hear thee burst and roar!"Livingston kicks at Paine\'s head, exclaiming,\n\n     "How are the mighty fallen,\n     Right fol-de-riddle-lol!"Bishop Hobart kicks the feet, tinging:\n     "Right fol-de-rol, let\'s dance and sing,\n     Tom is dead, God save the king--\n     The infidel now low doth lie--\n     Sing Hallelujah--hallelujah!"A Quaker turns away with a shovel, saying,\n     "I \'ll not bury thee."Such was the religion which was supposed by some to have won Paine\'s\nheart at last, but which, when mirrored in the controversy over his\ndeath, led to a tremendous reaction.The division in the Quaker Society\nswiftly developed.In December, 1826, there was an afternoon meeting of\nQuakers of a critical kind, some results of which led directly to the\nseparation.The chief speaker was Elias Hicks, but it is also recorded\nthat "Willet Hicks was there, and had a short testimony, which seemed to\nbe impressive on the meeting."He had stood in silence beside the grave\nof the man whose chances in the next world he had rather take than those\nof any man in New York; but now the silence is broken.*\n\n     * Curiously enough, Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale turned up again.She had broken down under the cross-examination of William\n     Cobbett, but he had long been out of the country when the\n     Quaker separation took place.Mary now reported that a\n     distinguished member of the Hicksite Society, Mary Lock\n     wood, had recanted in the same way as Paine.This being\n     proved false, the hysterical Mary sank and remained in\n     oblivion, from which she is recalled only by the Rev.Rip\n     Van Winkle.It was the unique sentence on Paine to recant\n     and yet be damned.This honor belies the indifference\n     expressed in the rune taught children sixty years ago:\n\n     "Poor Tom Paine!there he lies:\n     Nobody laughs and nobody cries:\n     Where he has gone or how he fares,\n     Nobody knows and nobody cares!"I told Walt Whitman, himself partly a product of Hicksite Quakerism,\nof the conclusion to which I had been steadily drawn, that Thomas Paine\nrose again in Elias Hicks, and was in some sort the origin of our one\nAmerican religion.I said my visit was mainly to get his "testimony" on\nthe subject for my book, as he was born in Hicks\' region, and mentions\nin "Specimen Days" his acquaintance with Paine\'s friend, Colonel\nFellows.Walt said, for I took down his words at the time:\n\n"In my childhood a great deal was said of Paine in our neighborhood, in\nLong Island.My father, Walter Whitman, was rather favorable to Paine.I remember hearing Elias Hicks preach; and his look, slender figure,\nearnestness, made an impression on me, though I was only about eleven.He is well represented in the bust there, one of my\ntreasures.I was a young man when I enjoyed the friendship of Col.Fellows,--then a constable of the courts; tall, with ruddy face,\nblue eyes, snowy hair, and a fine voice; neat in dress, an old-school\ngentleman, with a military air, who used to awe the crowd by his looks;\nthey used to call him \'Aristides.\'I used to chat with him in Tammany\nHall.It was a time when, in religion, there was as yet no philosophical\nmiddle-ground; people were very strong on one side or the other; there\nwas a good deal of lying, and the liars were often well paid for\ntheir work.Paine and his principles made the great issue.Paine was\ndouble-damnably lied about.Fellows was a man of perfect truth\nand exactness; he assured me that the stories disparaging to Paine\npersonally were quite false.Paine was neither drunken nor filthy; he\ndrank as other people did, and was a high-minded gentleman.I incline to\nthink you right in supposing a connection between the Paine excitement\nand the Hicksite movement.Paine left a deep, clear-cut impression on\nthe public mind.Fellows told me that while Paine was in New York\nhe had a much larger following than was generally supposed.After his\ndeath a reaction in his favor appeared among many who had opposed him,\nand this reaction became exceedingly strong between 1820 and 1830, when\nthe division among the Quakers developed.Probably William Cobbett\'s\nconversion to Paine had something to do with it.Cobbett lived in the\nneighborhood of Elias Hicks, in Long Island, and probably knew him.Hicks was a fair-minded man, and no doubt read Paine\'s books carefully\nand honestly.I am very glad you are writing the Life of Paine.Paine was among the best and truest of men."Paine\'s risen soul went marching on in England also.The pretended\nrecantation proclaimed there was exploded by William Cobbett, and the\nwhole controversy over Paine\'s works renewed.One after another deist\nwas sent to prison for publishing Paine\'s works, the last being Richard\nCarlile and his wife.In 1819, the year in which William Cobbett\ncarried Paine\'s bones to England, Richard Carlile and his wife, solely\nfor this offence, were sent to prison,--he for three years, with fine of\nL1,500, she for two years, with fine of L500,* This was a suicidal\nvictory for bigotry.When these two came out of prison they found that\nwealthy gentlemen had provided for them an establishment in Fleet\nStreet, where these books were thenceforth sold unmolested.Carlile\'s petition to the House of Commons awakened that body and the\nwhole country.When Richard Carlile entered prison it was as a captive\ndeist; when he came out the freethinkers of England were generally\natheists.* I have before me an old fly-leaf picture, issued by\n     Carlile in the same year.It shows Paine in his chariot\n     advancing against Superstition.Superstition is a snaky-\n     haired demoness, with poison-cup in one hand and dagger in\n     the other, surrounded by instruments of torture, and\n     treading on a youth.Behind her are priests, with mask,\n     crucifix, and dagger.Burning <DW19>s surround them with a\n     cloud, behind which are worshippers around an idol, with a\n     priest near by, upholding a crucifix before a man burning at\n     the stake.Attended by fair genii, who uphold a banner\n     inscribed, "Moral Rectitude."Paine advances, uplifting in\n     one hand the mirror of Truth, in the other his "Age of\n     Reason."There are ten stanzas describing the conflict,\n     Superstition being described as holding\n\n     "in vassalage a doating World,\n     Till Paine and Reason burst upon the mind,\n     And Truth and Deism their flag unfurled."Common sense and common justice were entering into religion as they were\nentering into government.Such epithets as "atheism," "infidelity,"\nwere but labels of outlawry which the priesthood of all denominations\npronounced upon men who threatened their throne, precisely as "sedition"\nwas the label of outlawry fixed by Pitt on all hostility to George III.In England, atheism was an insurrection of justice against any deity\ndiabolical enough to establish the reign of terror in that country\nor any deity worshipped by a church which imprisoned men for their\nopinions.Paine was a theist, but he arose legitimately in his admirer\nShelley, who was punished for atheism.Knightly service was done by\nShelley in the struggle for the Englishman\'s right to read Paine.If\nany enlightened religious man of to-day had to choose between the\ngodlessness of Shelley and the godliness that imprisoned good men for\ntheir opinions, he would hardly select the latter.The genius of Paine\nwas in every word of Shelley\'s letter to Lord Ellenborough on the\npunishment of Eaton for publishing the "Age of Reason."*\n\n     * "Whence is any right derived, but that which power\n     confers, for persecution?Eaton\n     to your religion by embittering his existence?You might\n     force him by torture to profess your tenets, but he could\n     not believe them except you should make them credible, which\n     perhaps exceeds your power.Do you think to please the God\n     you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?If so the\n     demon to whom some nations offer human hecatombs is less\n     barbarous than the Deity of civilized society.... Does\n     the Christian God, whom his followers eulogize as the deity\n     of humility and peace--he, the regenerator of the world, the\n     meek reformer--authorise one man to rise against another,\n     and, because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture\n     him as an infidel?When the Apostles went abroad to convert\n     the nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who\n     disbelieved the divinity of Christ\'s mission?...The\n     time is rapidly approaching--I hope that you, my Lord, may\n     live to behold its arrival--when the Mahometan, the Jew, the\n     Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist will live together in\n     one community, equally sharing the benefits which arrive\n     from its association, and united in the bonds of charity and\n     brotherly love."In America "atheism" was never anything but the besom which again and\nagain has cleared the human mind of phantasms represented in outrages on\nhonest thinkers.In Paine\'s time the phantasm which was called Jehovah\nrepresented a grossly ignorant interpretation of the Bible; the\nrevelation of its monstrous character, represented in the hatred,\nslander, falsehood, meanness, and superstition, which Jarvis represented\nas crows and vultures hovering near the preachers kicking Paine\'s dead\nbody, necessarily destroyed the phantasm, whose pretended power was\nproved nothing more than that of certain men to injure a man who\nout-reasoned them.Paine\'s fidelity to his unanswered argument was\nfatal to the consecrated phantasm.It was confessed to be ruling without\nreason, right, or humanity, like the King from whom "Common Sense,"\nmainly, had freed America, and not by any "Grace of God" at all, but\nthrough certain reverend Lord Norths and Lord Howes.Paine\'s peaceful\ndeath, the benevolent distribution of his property by a will affirming\nhis Theism, represented a posthumous and potent conclusion to the "Age\nof Reason."Paine had aimed to form in New York a Society for Religious Inquiry,\nalso a Society of Theophilan-thropy.The latter was formed, and his\nposthumous works first began to appear, shortly after his death, in an\norgan called _The Theophilanthropist_.But his movement was too cosmopolitan to be contained in any local\norganization."Thomas Paine," said President Andrew Jackson to Judge\nHertell, "Thomas Paine needs no monument made by hands; he has erected\na monument in the hearts of all lovers of liberty."The like may be\nsaid of his religion: Theophilanthropy, under a hundred translations and\nforms, is now the fruitful branch of every religion and every sect.The\nreal cultivators of skepticism,--those who ascribe to deity biblical\nbarbarism, and the savagery of nature,--have had their day.The removal and mystery of Paine\'s bones appear like some page of Mosaic\nmythology.* An English caricature pictured Cobbett seated on Paine\'s\ncoffin, in a boat named Rights of Man, rowed by <DW64> Slaves.* The bones of Thomas Paine were landed in Liverpool\n     November 21, 1819.The monument contemplated by Cobbett was\n     never raised.There was much parliamentary and municipal\n     excitement.A Bolton town-crier was imprisoned nine weeks\n     for proclaiming the arrival.In 1836 the bones passed with\n     Cobbett\'s effects into the hands of a Receiver (West).The\n     Lord Chancellor refusing to regard them as an asset, they\n     were kept by an old day-laborer until 1844, when they passed\n     to B. Tilley, 13 Bedford Square, London, a furniture dealer.In 1849 the empty coffin was in possession of J. Chennell,\n     Guildford.The silver plate bore the inscription "Thomas\n     Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged 72."R. Ainslie\n     (Unitarian) told E. Truelove that he owned "the skull and\n     the right hand of Thomas Paine," but evaded subsequent\n     inquiries.Of\n     Paine\'s gravestone the last fragment was preserved by his\n     friends of the Bayeaux family, and framed on their wall.In\n     November, 1839, the present marble monument at New Rochelle\n     was erected.Francis] led me to pay a visit to\nCobbett at his country seat, within a couple of miles of the city, on\nthe island, on the very day that he had exhumed the bones of Paine, and\nshipped them for England.I will here repeat the words which Cobbett\ngave utterance to at the friendly interview our party had with him.\'I\nhave just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has been too long delayed:\nyou have neglected too long the remains of Thomas Paine.I have done\nmyself the honor to disinter his bones.I have removed them from New\nRochelle.I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England.When\nI myself return, I shall cause them to speak the common sense of\nthe great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and\nManchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will\neffect the reformation of England in Church and State.\'"Badeau, of New Rochelle, remembers standing near Cobbett\'s workmen\nwhile they were digging up the bones, about dawn.There is a legend that\nPaine\'s little finger was left in America, a fable, perhaps, of his once\nsmall movement, now stronger than the loins of the bigotry that refused\nhim a vote or a grave in the land he so greatly served.As to his bones,\nno man knows the place of their rest to this day.His thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world\nwhich he held in his heart.For a hundred years no human being has been\nborn in the civilized world without some spiritual tincture from that\nheart whose every pulse was for humanity, whose last beat broke a fetter\nof fear, and fell on the throne of thrones.APPENDIX A. THE COBBETT PAPERS.In the autumn of 1792 William Cobbett arrived in America.Among the\npapers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from\nCobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr.Short, U. S. Secretary\nof Legation at Paris.In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware,\nNovember 2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become\nthe citizen of a free state I have left my native country, England, for\nAmerica.I bring with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary\ntalents, and that is all."Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited\nParis, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted\nwith the revolution he left for America.He had conceived a dislike of\nthe French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine.He\nthus became an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George\nChalmers, which had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the\nstatements of that work in a brief biographical sketch published in\nPhiladelphia, 1796.In later life Cobbett became convinced that he had\nbeen deceived into giving fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine\npublished in Europe a work that filled Cobbett with admiration.This was\n"The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which predicted\nthe suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that followed the\nnext year.The pamphlet became Cobbett\'s text-book, and his _Register_\nwas eloquent in Paine\'s praise, the more earnestly, he confessed,\nbecause he had "been one of his most violent assailants.""Old age\nhaving laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly philosophical\npolitician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."A sketch of Thomas Paine and some related papers of Cobbett are\ngenerously confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through her\nnephew, William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England.The public announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his\nintention to write a Life-of Paine, led to his negotiation with\nMadame Bonneville, who, with her husband, resided in New York.Madame\nBonneville had been disposing of some of Paine\'s manuscripts, such as\nthat on "Freemasonry," and the reply to Bishop Watson, printed in\n_The Theophilanthropist_ (1810).She had also been preparing, with her\nhusband\'s assistance, notes for a biography of Paine, because of the\n"unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr.Paine"; adding, "_Et\nl\'indignation ma fait prendre la plume_."Cobbett agreed to give her\na thousand dollars for the manuscript, which was to contain important\nletters from and to eminent men.She stated (September 30, 1819)\nher conditions, that it should be published in England, without any\naddition, and separate from any other writings.I suppose it was one or\nall of these conditions that caused the non-completion of the bargain.Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is now all in his writing\nexcept a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I indicate by\nbrackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett.Although Madame\nBonneville gave some revision to Cobbett\'s manuscript, most of the\nletters to be supplied are merely indicated.No trace of them exists\namong the Cobbett papers.Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris,\nwhere they kept a small book shop.His biography\nin Michaud\'s Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that\nin 1829 she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous\npapers of Thomas Paine.From this it would appear that she had retained\nthe manuscript, and the original letters.In 1833 Madame Bonneville\nemigrated to St.Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville,\nlived.Her Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years,\nand to that cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal\nCheetham had raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with\nthe result mentioned in the introduction to this work.Louis, October 30, 1846, at the age of 79.Probably William Cobbett\ndid not feel entitled to publish the manuscript obtained under such\nconditions, or he might have waited for the important documents that\nwere never sent.The recollections are those of both M.\nand Madame Bonneville.The reader will find no difficulty in making out\nthe parts that represent Madame\'s personal knowledge and reminiscences,\nas Cobbett has preserved her speech in the first person, and, with\ncharacteristic literary acumen, her expressions in such important\npoints.His manuscript is perfect, and I have little editing to do\nbeyond occasional correction of a date, supplying one or two letters\nindicated, which I have found, and omitting a few letters, extracts,\netc., already printed in the body of this work, where unaccompanied by\nany comment or addition from either Cobbett or the Bonnevilles.At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was\nstill a provincial place.Nicolas Bonneville, as Irving describes him,\nseated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have\nbeen regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation\nfrom his family was due to detention by the police.Madame Bonneville is\nreserved on that point.The following incident, besides illustrating the\ncharacters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor\nof Bonneville\'s surveillance.In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were\nediting the _Bien Informe_, a "suspect" sought asylum with them.This\nwas Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused\nhis denunciation as a royalist.He had escaped from the Terror, and now\nwandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity\nof the two men whose protection he asked.He remained, as proof-reader,\nin the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy\nof 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against\nroyalists, the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising\nhis benefactors, and disappeared.When the royalist conspiracy against\nBonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and\narrested (1802).His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the\npolice his former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville.Bonaparte sent by\nFouche a warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him,\nand that "on the first complaint he would be sent to his own country,\nAmerica."Whether this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were\nconnected with the Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due\nto their anti-slavery writings on Domingo, remains conjectural.Towards\nthe close of life Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to\nhis widow.So much even a monarchy with an established church could do\nfor a republican author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published\nheresies like those of Paine.THOMAS PAINE, A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.[More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every\nCircumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,\nsince many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,\ntracing him back to the day of his]* birth, we shall shortly observe,\nthat, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the\nCounty of Norfolk, England on the 29.January, in the year 1737; that\nhis father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that\nhis mother was the daughter of a country attorney, and that she belonged\nto the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards\nbecame a Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787,\nas appears from a letter of the father to the son.* The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville\'s, are on a\n     separate slip.An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed\n     out by her pen: "The early years of the life of a Great Man\n     are of little consequence to the world.Whether Paine made\n     stays or gauged barrels before he became a public character,\n     is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled\n     with woollen or with linen.It is the man, in conjunction\n     with those labours which have produced so much effect in the\n     world, whom we are to follow and contemplate.Nevertheless,\n     since many pretended histories of the life of Paine have\n     been published, etc."The above-mentioned histories relate (and the correctness of the\nstatement has not been denied by him), that Paine was educated at the\nfree-school of Thetford; that he left it in 1752, when he was fifteen\nyears of age, and then worked for some time with his father: that in a\nyear afterwards, he went to London: that from London he went to Dover:\nthat about this time he was on the eve of becoming a sailor: that he\nafterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between the years 1759\nand 1774 he was a stay maker, an excise officer, a grocer, and an usher\nto a school; and that, during the period he was twice married, and\nseparated by mutual consent, from his second wife.*\n\n     * The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories\n     require revision by the light of the careful researches made\n     by myself and others, as given at the beginning of this\n     biography.In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from\nEngland for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his\nhistory; for here we have him in connection with his literary labours.It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his\nown words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever\nwe find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or\nfragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge\nfor himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances._Sauvent d\'un\ngrand dessin un mot nous fait juger_."A word often enables us to judge\nof a great design.""I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of\nhostilities.I found the disposition of the people such that they might\nhave been led by a thread and governed by a reed.Their suspicion was\nquick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,\nand it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it.They\ndisliked the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation.Their idea of\ngrievance operated without resentment, and their single object was\nreconciliation.Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived\nthem capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of\nhostilities; much less did I imagine the Nation would encourage it.I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the\nparties would find a way either to decide or settle it.I had no\nthoughts of independence or of arms.The world could not then have\npersuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author.If I had\nany talents for either they were buried in me, and might ever have\ncontinued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them\ninto action.I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy\nwished everybody else so.But when the country, into which I had just\nset my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.It was\ntime for every man to stir."*\n\n     * From Crisis vii., dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778.His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for\nyoung ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then\nlittle known in the education of young American ladies.But, in 1775, he\nundertook the management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.About this time he published, in Bradford\'s journal, an essay on the\nslavery, of the <DW64>s, which was universally well received; and also\nstanzas on the death of General Wolfe.In 1776, January 10, he published Common Sense.In the same year he\njoined the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene.Gordon, in his history\nof the Independence of the United States (vol.78), says:\n[Wanting]--Ramsay (Lond.Franklin preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one\nelse-where given, in the Hall manuscripts]\n\nWhen Washington had made his retreat from New York Thomas Paine\npublished the first number of the Crisis, which was read to every\ncorporal\'s guard in the camp.It revived the army, reunited the members\nof the [New York] Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in\nnumber, while the militia were abandoning their standards and flying in\nall directions.The success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree,\nowing to this first number of the Crisis.In 1778 he discovered the\nrobberies of Silas Deane, an agent of the United States in France.He gave in his resignation as Secretary, which was accepted by the\nCongress.In 1779 he was appointed-Clerk to the General Assembly of\nPennsylvania, which office he retained until 1780.In 1780 he departed\nfor France with Col.John Laurens, commissioned especially by the\nCongress to the Court at Versailles to obtain the aid that was wanted.After his return from France he\nreceived the following letter from Col.Laurens:\n\n"Carolina, April 18, 1782.--I received the letter wherein you mention\nmy horse and trunk, (the latter of which was left at Providence).The misery which the former has suffered at different times, by\nmismanagement, has greatly distressed me.He was wounded in service, and\nI am much attached to him.If he can be of any service to you, I entreat\nyour acceptance of him, more especially if you will make use of him in\nbringing you to a country (Carolina) where you will be received with\nopen arms, and all that affection and respect which our citizens are\nanxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and the Crisis.I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your\nparticular home--and everything that I can command in it to be in common\nbetween us."On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received\nand published.Nathaniel Greene:\n\n"Ashley-Rives (Carolina), Nov.18, 1782.--Many people wish to get you\ninto this country."I see you are determined to follow your genius and not your fortune.I have always been in hopes that Congress would have made some handsome\nacknowledgement to you for past services.I must confess that I think\nyou have been shamefully neglected; and that America is indebted to few\ncharacters more than to you.But as your passion leads to fame, and\nnot to wealth, your mortification will be the less.Your fame for\nyour writings, will be immortal.At present my expenses are great;\nnevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I shall take a pride\nand pleasure in contributing all in my power to render your situation\nhappy."\'Then letter from his father.--"Dear Son, &c."The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)\nwill show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the\nmost famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been\nuseful to the country.**\n\nAt this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirk-bride,\nBordentown, where he remained till his departure for France.He had\nbought a house [in], and five acres of marshy land over against,\nBordentown, near the Delaware, which overflowed it frequently.Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine\nreceived in the same month.He carried with him the model of\na bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in\na drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved.From Paris he\nwent to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went\nto Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and\nwhere he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.* This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge\nwas cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr.The experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.When Burke published his _Reflexions on the French Revolution_, Thomas\nPaine answered him in his First Part of the Rights of Man.In January,\n1792, appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man.The sale of the\nRights of Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to\nabout a hundred thousand copies.In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,\nMcDonald, and was defended by Mr.Erskine, and found guilty of libel.But he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the\nDepartment, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen.Two\nDepartments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and\nof Pas de Calais, of which he accepted the latter.He received the\nfollowing letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de\nSechelles:\n\n"To Thomas Paine:\n\n"France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful\nand most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,\nto the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and\nare united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world."It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Many to desire\namong her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences\nof those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that\nCommon Senset which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the\nconception of which springs forth from nature and truth."The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and had seen\nwith pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate\nauthority, that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before\nyou were nominated."Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of scenes for an\nobserver and a philosopher,--that of a confiding and generous people\nwho, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the\nstruggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at\nlength arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword\nof the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the\nbarbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation.Her citizens\nturned soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and\ncollects in congress the lights scattered through the universe.Men of\ngenius, the most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to\ngive to her people a government the most proper to insure their liberty\nand happiness."The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the\nfirst to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that\nhonour; and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of\nyour election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at\nMr.Jefferson\'s, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure\nof knowing you."Herault,\n\n"President of the National Assembly."before the National Convention Thomas Paine\nat the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter,\ngave his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis:--That,\nthough a Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not\nforget, that, previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United\nStates of America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude\nwould not allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America.On the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of\nLouis XV.Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of\nLegislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the\naid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution.**\n\n     * Both missing.Possibly the second should be to Danton.The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March!793, when\nthe greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had\nretired [from the Convention].But, as the intention of the conspiracy\nagainst the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the\nDeputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening\ndanger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyranny of\nsome usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate\ntheir horrible machinations.They therefore, for this time, confined\nthemselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the\nmost valuable part of the National Convention.Robespiere had placed\nhimself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate\n_laws of blood_ and proscription to the Convention.All those whom he\ncould not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of\nanti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could\ndestroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly\ndestined to disappear from among the living.Thomas Paine, as his marked\nenemy and rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed\namong the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the\nLuxembourg in December 1793.|\n\nFrom this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was,\nfor a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory.It was during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre\ntook place.Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote\nto Mr.Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter\nto Washington.Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter\nfrom Peter Whiteside.** In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote\na memorial to Mr.Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he\n_came out of the prison on the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months\nof imprisonment_.Monroe, who had cordially\noffered him his house.In a short time after, the Convention called\nhim to take his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he\nalleges in his letter to Washington.The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on\nAristocracy.""Essay on the character of Robespierre."* This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared\n     Cobbett had written such a scathing review.** The letter telling him of the allegations made by some\n     against his American citizenship.Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose\nhusband was then a prisoner of war in Austria:\n\n"19 Brumaire, Paris.--I was this morning so much agitated by the kind\nvisit from Mr.Monroe, that I could hardly find words to speak; but,\nhowever, I was, my dear Sir, desirous to tell you, that the news of your\nbeing set at liberty, which I this morning learnt from General Kilmaine,\nwho arrived here at the same time with me, has given me a moment\'s\nconsolation in the midst of this abyss of misery, where I shall all my\nlife remain plunged.Kilmaine has told me that you recollected\nme, and have taken great interest in my situation; for which I am\nexceedingly grateful.Monroe, my congratulations upon your being\nrestored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from\nher who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of\ncitizen of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed,\nnor shall ever fail, to the former."With all sincerity of my heart,\n\n"N.On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part\nof the "Age of Reason."Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to\nGen.Monroe entreated him not to\nsend it, and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was\nafterwards published.A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever.Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention.She provided him\nwith an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity\nof a sister.She neglected nothing to afford him ease and comfort, when\nhe was totally unable to help himself.He was in the state of a helpless\nchild who has its face and hands washed by its mother.The surgeon was\nthe famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his\nside.After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being\nvery sick, he, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent\nnurse to take care of his sick friend: a fact of little account\nin itself, but a sure evidence of ardent and active friendship and\nkindness.The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what\nConstitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas\nPaine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original]\nCommittee [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read\nit in the Tribune.This speech has been translated into English, and\npublished in London; but, the language of the author has been changed\nby the two translations.It is now given as written by the author.In April, 1796, he wrote his _Decline and Fail of the British System of\nFinance _; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to\nWashington off for America by Mr.-------- who sent it to Mr.Bache, a\nnewspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published\nthe same year.The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and\nwho wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore\nwe suppress it.We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign\nAffairs, to show that Thomas Paine was always active and attentive in\ndoing every thing which would be useful to America.Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the\nConvention wrote the following letter.The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: "Paris,\nOctober 4, 1796."In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Fart of the Age of\nReason.Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine\nwent to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States.But, he did\nnot, upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great\nnumber of English vessels then cruizing in the Channel.He therefore\ncame back to Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13\nApril 1797, to a friend at Paris.The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:\n"Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc."At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.Bonneville\'s, who had known him at the Minister Roland\'s, and as Mr.B.\nspoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar\nand friendly manner than to any other persons of the society.It was a\nreception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a\nweek or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.Bonneville parted,--alas never to meet again!All the first floor was\noccupied as a printing office.The whole house was pretty well filled;\nand Mr.Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a\nbed-chamber to Thomas Paine.He was always in his apartments excepting\nat meal times.He then used to read the newspapers, from\nwhich, though he understood but little of the French language when\nspoken, he did not fail to collect all the material information relating\nto politics, in which subject he took most delight.When he had his\nmorning\'s reading, he used to carry back the journals to Mr.Bonneville,\nand they had a chat upon the topicks of the day.If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by\nthe bridge of Neuilly, where Mr.Skipwith lived, he always went on\nfoot, after suitable preparations for the journey in that way.I do not\nbelieve he ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of\nhis stay in Paris.He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a\nwholesome exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than\nthat they were able to take it whenever they pleased.If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical\ninvention, or else entertaining his visitors.Not a day escaped without\nhis receiving many visits.Smith [Sir\nRobert] came very often to see him.Many travellers also called on him;\nand, often, having no other affair, talked to him only of his great\nreputation and their admiration of his works.He treated such visitors\nwith civility, but with little ceremony, and, when their conversation\nwas mere chit-chat, and he found they had nothing particular to say to\nhim, he used to retire to his own pursuits, leaving them to entertain\nthemselves with their own ideas.Smith\'s [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an Irish Coffee-house\nin Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American people met.He here\nlearnt the state of politics in England and America.He never went out\nafter dinner without first taking a nap, which was always of two or\nthree hours length.And, when he went out to a dinner of _parade_, he\noften came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed sleep.It was\nseldom he went into the society of French people; except when, by\nseeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour for his\ncountrymen who might be in need of his good offices.These he always\nperformed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most likely\nmeans to secure success.He wrote as\nfollows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy.C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the re-establishment\nof Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted.Paine\npublished, on this occasion, a letter to C.*\n\n     * The words "which will find a place in the Appendix" are\n     here crossed out by Madame Bonneville.258\n     concerning Jourdan.He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a\nbridge of his own construction and invention, which model had been\nadopted in England for building bridges under his own direction.He\nemployed part of his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to\nhigh perfection, and this accomplished to his wishes.He afterwards,\nand according the model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished b/\nmoulding different blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the\nform that he required.Though\nhe fully relied on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce\narguments enough in proof of its infallible strength, he often\ndemonstrated the proof by blows of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone\nin doubt on the subject.One night he took off the scaffold of his\nbridge and seeing that it stood firm under the repeated strokes of\nhammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment so great was not to be\nsufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom.He was not satisfied\nwithout admirers of his success.One night we had just gone to bed, and\nwere surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.Bonneville\'s room and besought him to go and see his bridge:\ncome and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a rock.Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy man as\nto please him by looking at his bridge.Nothing would do, unless I saw\nthe sight as well as Mr.After much exultation: "nothing, in\nthe world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing\nby without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!"which happy\ncompliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the\ntrouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine he\nhad executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another.The machine\nbeing put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed\nboards to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels.Bonneville has two of these wheels now.There is a specification\nof the wheels, given by Mr.This specification, together\nwith a drawing of the model, made by Mr.Fulton, were deposited at\nWashington, in February 1811; and the other documents necessary to\nobtain a patent as an invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of\nMadam Bonneville.To be presented to the Directory of France, a memorial\non the progress and construction of iron bridges.On this subject the\ntwo pieces here subjoined will throw sufficient light.(Memoir upon\nBridges.--Upon Iron Bridges.--To the Directory.--Memoir on the Progress\nand Construction &c.)Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.8. who was then in the house of\nTalma, and he wrote the following notes and instructions.Letter at\nBrussells.--The Ca-ira of America.--To the Consul Lepeaux.*\n\n     * This paragraph is in the writing of Madame Bonneville.means Bonaparte, and seems to be some cipher.All of the\n     pieces by Paine mentioned are missing; also that addressed\n     "To the Directory," for the answer to which see p.296 of\n     this volume.Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to\nsee Paine.One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of\nthe Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr.Livingston, when he\ngot up to go away, said to Mr.Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave\nthe mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc.to America, and your\nreligion to France."Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr.Bonneville\'s journal\n(the _Bien Informe_) several articles on passing events.*\n\n     * The following words are here crossed out: "Also several\n     pieces of poetry, which will be published hereafter, with\n     his miscellaneous prose."A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr.Smith\'s\n[Sir Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he\nwas neither in love, debt, nor difficulty.Some lady observed, that it\nwas not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love.Upon this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air\nto the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with\nthe following words: "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry\nthan the men are, I will thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be\ngallantry.If it be, it is truly original; and the merit of it belongs\nto the person who inspired it.""If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your new\ncovenant, many a fair ladies heart would be in danger, but the Little\nCorner of the World receives it from the Castle in the Air; it is\nagreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.--C.At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France.The real\nrepublicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions.Paine was a truly\ngrateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady.During the\nsix years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to\nAmerica, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying\nthat he would bequeath his property to our children.Some affairs of\ngreat consequence made it impracticable for Mr.Bonneville to quit\nFrance; but, foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally,\nmany of the Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure\nof Mr.Paine for America, that I should go thither with my children,\nrelying fully on the good offices of Mr.Paine, whose conduct in America\njustified that reliance.In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him.He embarked\nat Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr.Patterson, of\nBaltimore, he being the only passenger.After a very stormy passage, he\nlanded at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812.He remained there but\na few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters\nto the Americans.A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter\nof 12 November, 1802.He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York,\nwhere a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City\nHotel.In June, 1803, he went to Stonington, New England, to see some\nfriends; and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle.(The\nletter of Thomas Paine to Mr.Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he\naccepted, and while here he was taken ill.His complaint was a sort of\nparalytic affection, which took away the use of his hands.He had had\nthe same while at Mr.Monroe\'s in Paris, after he was released from\nprison.Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of\nthe winter, and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the\nspring (1804) he went back to his farm.The farmer who had had his farm\nfor 17 or 18 years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr.Paine a bill\nfor fencing, which made Paine his debtor!They had a law-suit by which\nPaine got nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses!This and\nother necessary expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land.He then gave the honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick\nto cultivate it for him.He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his\nplace, and he, therefore, discharged him.This was in the summer; and,\non Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o\'clock, Mr.Paine being in his\nroom, on the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the\nwindow.The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window,\nand all the charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day\ndiscovered, in the window sill and wall.The shooter, in firing the gun,\nfell; and the barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell,\nand left an impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning.Thomas Paine went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and\nthere (seeing a gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the\nmuzzle of the gun was filled with fresh earth.)And then he heard that\nChristopher Derick had borrowed the gun about five o\'clock the evening\nbefore, and had returned it again before six o\'clock the same evening.Derick was arrested, and Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately\nand voluntarily his bail.The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle;\nand Derick was acquitted.*\n\n     * See p.Several paragraphs here are in\n     the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his father in New\n     York.In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election.But his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being\na citizen of America; whereon he wrote the following letters.[_The\nletters are here missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp.379-80\nof this volume_..]\n\nThis case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr.Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as\nhis legatee, did not lose the having to pay for it.It is however, an\nundoubted fact, that Mr.He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,\noccasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,\nmade him resolve to go and live at New York.On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr.Bonneville [in Paris]:\n\n"My dear Bonneville: Why don\'t you come to America Your wife and two\nboys, Benjamin and Thomas, are here, and in good health.They all speak\nEnglish very well; but Thomas has forgot his French.I intend to provide\nfor the boys, but, I wish to see you here.We heard of you by letters by\nMadget and Captain Hailey.Thomas, an English\nwoman, keep an academy for young ladies."I send this by a friend, Mrs.Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the\nInstitute, to know where you are.And some time after the following letter:\n\n"My dear Bonneville: I received your letter by Mrs.Champlin, and also\nthe letter for Mrs.Bonneville, and one from her sister.I have written\nto the American Minister in Paris, Mr.Armstrong, desiring him to\ninterest himself to have your surveillance taken off on condition of\nyour coming to join your family in the United States.Bonneville\'s, come to you under cover to the\nAmerican Minister from Mr.As soon as you\nreceive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of\nthe proper method to have your surveillance taken off.Champagny,\nwho succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the\nInterior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting\nthe iron bridge.I think you once went with me to see him."Call on Mr Skipwith with my compliments.He will inform you what\nvessels will sail for New York and where from.Bordeaux will be the best\nplace to sail from.Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux.When you arrive there, call on him, with my compliments.You may\ncontrive to arrive at New York in April or May.The passages, in the\nSpring, are generally short; seldom more than five weeks, and often\nless."Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St.Pierre, Dupuis,\nGregoire.--When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I\nhave yet in manuscript, by subscription."*\n\n     * This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame\n     Bonneville.Beneath it is written: "The above is a true\n     copy of the original; I have compared the two together.The allusion to Champagny is either a\n     slip of Madame\'s pen or Paine\'s memory.The minister who\n     wrote him about his bridge was Chaptal.The\n     names in the last paragraph show what an attractive literary\n     circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable to\n     appreciate him.While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman\ncalled, and, asking for Mr.Paine, said she had something of great\nimportance to communicate to him.She was shown into his bed-chamber;\nand Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman,\nsaid: "What do you want with me?""I came," said she, "from God, to\ntell you, that if you don\'t repent, and believe in Christ, you \'ll be\ndammed.""Poh, poh, it\'s not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with\nsuch an impertinent message.God would not send\nsuch a foolish ugly old woman as you.Get away;\nbe off: shut the door."After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of\nNew York and Philadelphia.Subsequent to a short illness which he had\nin 1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking\nincreased every day.On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a\nmemorial to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for\nhis services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on\nthe same subject.These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as\nfollows.*\n\n     * "Are as follows" in Madame B.\'s writing, after striking\n     oat Cobbett\'s words, "will be found in the Appendix."The\n     documents and letters are not given, but they are well\n     known.The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted,\npassed the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave\nto withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same."He\nwas deeply grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing\nhimself to it.But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were\ngreatly augmented by his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish,\nwhile he feared a total palsy; and while he expected to live to a\nvery great age, as his ancestors had before him.His money yielded no\ninterest, always having been unwilling to place money out in that way.He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them\nanother will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his\nfriend, and that now having altered his belief in them, he had also\naltered his will.From motives of the same kind, he, three months before\nhis death, made another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and\ngave it me to keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it\nthan any body else.He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a\nmember of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood.The interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809.Paine said, when we\nwere looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs\nof our present abode.This was precisely the case with him; all his\naffairs were settled, and he had only to provide his burying-ground;\nhis father had been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a\ngrave; "I will," added he, "pay for the digging of it."The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which\nhe seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the\ninterview, that their refusal was foolish."You will," said I, "be\nburied on your farm" "I have no objection to that," said he "but the\nfarm will be sold, and they will dig my bones up before they be half\nrotten."Paine," I replied, "have confidence in your friends.I\nassure you, that the place where you will be buried, shall never be\nsold."He seemed satisfied; and never spoke upon this subject again.I\nhave been as good as my word.Last December (1818) the land of the farm having been divided between\nmy children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place\nwhereon the grave was.Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere.He anxiously\nrecommended us to the protection of Mr.Emmet, saying to him, "when I\nam dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here."And a little time\nafter, obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of\nsorrow, "you will have nothing left."*\n\n     * Paine\'s Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton\n     (with $200 each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a\n     small bequest to the widow of Elihu Palmer, and a\n     considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to divide\n     with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North\n     part of his farm.To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts,\n     movable effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance\n     Company estimated at $1500, and money in hand.The South\n     part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100 acres, were given\n     Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin and\n     Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to\n     the age of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them\n     well up, give them good and useful learning, and instruct\n     them in their duty to God, and the practice of morality."At\n     majority they were to share and share alike in fee simple.He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground,--"my father\n     belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in\n     it,"--but if this is not permitted, to be buried on his\n     farm."The place where I am to be buried to be a square of\n     twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone\n     or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my name and\n     age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."He confides\n     Mrs.Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and\n     Morton."Thus placing confidence in their friendship, I\n     herewith take my final leave of them and of the world.I\n     have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time\n     has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect\n     composure and resignation to the will of my Creator God."The Will, dated January 18, opens with the words,\n     "The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas\n     Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no\n     other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no\n     other."Paine had died July 27th, 1808.William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much\n     information concerning the Bonnevilles in St.Louis, writes\n     me that so little is known of Paine\'s benefactions, that\n     "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted that\n     Gen.Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French\n     lady; and a French lady, who was intimate with the\n     Bonnevilles, assured me that General Bonneville was sent to\n     West Point by Lafayette."His strength and appetite daily\ndeparted from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in\nbed, to sit up in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes\nwrite.When he could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the\nnewspapers to him.He wrote nothing for the\npress after writing his last will, but he would converse, and took\ngreat interest in politics.The vigour of his mind, which had always\nso strongly characterized him, did not leave him to the last moment.He\nnever complained of his bodily sufferings, though they became excessive.The want of exercise alone was the cause of\nhis sufferings.Notwithstanding the great inconveniences he was obliged\nto sustain during his illness, in a carman\'s house [Ryder\'s] in a small\nvillage [Greenwich], without any bosom friend in whom he could repose\nconfidence, without any society he liked, he still did not complain of\nhis sufferings.I indeed, went regularly to see him twice a week;\nbut, he said to me one day: "I am here alone, for all these people are\nnothing to me, day after day, week after week, month after month, and\nyou don\'t come to see me."[Albert] Gallatin, about this\ntime, I recollect his using these words: "_I am very sorry that I ever\nreturned to this country_."As he was thus situated and paying a high\nprice for his lodgings he expressed a wish to come to my house.This\nmust be a great inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr.Thomas Paine; but, I, at last, consented; and hired a house in the\nneighborhood, in May 1809, to which he was carried in an arm-chair,\nafter which he seemed calm and satisfied, and gave himself no trouble\nabout anything.He had no disease that required a Doctor, though\nDr.Romaine came to visit him twice a week.The swelling, which had\ncommenced at his feet, had now reached his body, and some one had been\nso officious as to tell him that he ought to be tapped.I told him, that I did not know; but, that, unless\nhe was likely to derive great good from it, it should not be done.The\nnext [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a physician with him, and\nthey resolved that the tapping need not take place.A very few days before his\ndeath, Dr.Romame said to me, "I don\'t think he can live till night."Paine, hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "\'T is\nyou Doctor: what news?"such an one is gone to France on such\nbusiness.""He will do nothing there," said Paine."Your belly\ndiminishes," said the Doctor."And yours augments," said Paine.* The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonno he had\n     not seen for a long while.He was overjoyed at seeing him;\n     but, this person began to speak upon religion, and Paine\n     turned his head on the other side, and remained silent, even\n     to the adieu of the person.When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and\nto talk with him on religious matters."Let me alone," said he; "good\nmorning."One of his friends\ncame to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom\nseeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend,\nif he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house,\nupon which he could only exclaim, O!He added other words, but\nthey were incoherent It was impossible for me not to exert myself to\nthe utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed\nso much.He now appeared to have lost all kind of feeling.He spent\nthe night in tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o\'clock,\nafter a short oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from\nthe city of New York.Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a\nportrait of him, moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was\nexecuted.He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany\ncoffin, with his name and age engraved on a silver-plate, put on the\ncoffin.His corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck\nand wrists with black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put\nunder his head as a pillow.(He never slept in a night-cap.)Before the\ncoffin was placed on the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose\nin my bosom, I took it out, and placed on his breast.Death had not\ndisfigured him.Though very thin, his bones were not protuberant.He was\nnot wrinkled, and had lost very little hair.His voice was very strong even to his last moments.He often exclaimed,\noh, lord help me!He\ngroaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his\nname, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream.He never answered\nthe question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o\'clock, &c.\n\nOn the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine\'s friends,\nset off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm;\nbut the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine,\nwalking with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he\nwas desirous of being buried there."Then," said I, "that shall be\nthe place of his burial."And, my instructions were accordingly put in\nexecution.The head-stone was put up about a week afterwards with the\nfollowing inscription: "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died\nthe eighth of June, 1809, aged 72 years."According to his will, a wall\ntwelve feet square was erected round his tomb.Four trees have been\nplanted outside the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses.Many\npersons have taken away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in\nmemory of the deceased; foreigners especially have been eager to obtain\nthese memorials, some of which have been sent to England.* They have\nbeen put in frames and preserved.Verses in honor of Paine have been\nwritten on the head stone.The grave is situated at the angle of the\nfarm, by the entrance to it.This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an\nobscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help\nfeeling most acutely.Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin,\nI, placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,\n"stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I\nexclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh!My\nson stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for\nFrance!"This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and\nphilosopher!**\n\n     * The breaking of the original gravestone has been\n     traditionally ascribed to pious hatred.A fragment of it,\n     now in New York, is sometimes shown at celebrations of\n     Paine\'s birthday as a witness of the ferocity vented on\n     Paine\'s grave.It is satisfactory to find another\n     interpretation.** Paine\'s friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave\n     their work in the city, which had refused Paine a grave.Robert Bolton, in his History of Westchester County,\n     introduces Cheetham\'s slanders of Paine with the words: "as\n     his own biographer remarks."But even Cheetham\n     does not lie enough for Bolton, who says: "His [Paine\'s]\n     body was brought up from New York in a hearse used for\n     carrying the dead, to Potter\'s Field; a white man drove the\n     vehicle, accompanied by a <DW64> to dig the grave."The whole\n     Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter\'s Field.Such\n     is history, where Paine is concerned!The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an\nacre.The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been\nsold for the total sum of 1425 dollars.The other part of the south,\nwhich was left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in\nlots, reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece\nof land 45 feet square._Thomas Paine\'s posthumous works_.He left the manuscript of his answer\nto Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces\non Religious subjects, prose and verse.The great part of his posthumous\npolitical works will be found in the Appendix.Some correspondences\ncannot be, as yet, published.*\n\nIn _Mechanics_ he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of\na machine to plane boards.Of the two models of bridges, left at the\nPhiladelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great\ndisorder, one side being taken entirely off.But, I must say here, that\nit was then out of the hands of Mr.Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,\ninstead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be\nviewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations\nwill make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding\nhim as a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character\naccording to their real worth.Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and\nabout five feet six French measure.His bust was well proportioned;\nand his face oblong.Reflexion was the great expression of his face;\nin which was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of\nreproach.His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told\nus that he saw into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to\ndeceive him].***\n\n     * All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist,\n     and some poems, were no doubt consumed at St.Louis, as\n     stated in the Introduction to this work.** I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of\n     Paine\'s bridges.In this paragraph and some\n     that follow the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think,\n     discernible.A most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an\naffectionate salutation, or praise delicately conveyed.His leg and\nfoot were elegant, and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or\naffectation.[He never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with\nhis hat in one hand and with his other hand behind his back.His\ncountenance, when walking, was generally thoughtful.In receiving\nsalutations he bowed very gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he\ndid not begin with "how d\' ye do?"If they had\nnone, he gave them his.His beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his\neye-brow, all aided in developing his mind.Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened\nto over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their\npaper.His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of\njobbing and the tricks of government, he always looked on as the\nsure thermometer of public affairs.Parliamentary Debates, the Bills,\nconcealing a true or sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret\npay and violent theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or\nprivate meetings at the taverns; these interested him so much that he\nlonged for an ear and a heart to pour forth all his soul.When he\nadded that he knew the Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm,\nbeforehand, that such or such a bill, such or such a measure, would\ntake place; and very seldom, in such a case, the cunning politic or the\nclear-sighted observer was mistaken in his assertions; for they were not\nfor him mere conjectures.He spoke of a future event as of a thing past\nand consummated.In a country where the slightest steps are expanded to\nopen day, where the feeblest connexions are known from their beginning,\nand with all the views of ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is\nalmost impossible to escape the eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine,\nwhom no private interest could blind or bewitch, as was said by the\nclear-sighted Michael Montaigne.His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they\ndiscover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire.One may see that he\nwishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success.But Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his\nvehement and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place\nwhere you ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to\nenvy and stupidity.Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned.He used to say, that he\nthought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do\nyou think of that?"On his arrival at New York, he went to see General\nGates.After the usual words of salutation, the General said: "I have\nalways had it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you\nwere married, as people have said."Paine not answering, the General\nwent on: "Tell me how it is.""I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent\nquestions."Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just\nwailings of the unhappy.Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,\nyou might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking\nof the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did\nthey go from him without some rays of hope.And as his will was firm and\nsettled, his efforts were always successful.The man hardened in vice\nand in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the\nmanly entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.* At this point are the words: "Barlow\'s letter [i. e. to\n     Cheetham] we agreed to suppress."Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection.His simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,\ncarelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good\nLafontaine, made him extremely amiable.If little children were near him\nhe patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,\nsugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of\na treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to\nhim.* His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language\nnatural; always abounding in curious anecdotes.He justly and fully\nseized the characters of all those of whom he related any singular\ntraits.For his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of\nwitticisms.If he related an anecdote a second time, it was always in\nthe same words and the same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place\nwhere he is to be applauded.He neither cut the tale short nor told it\ntoo circumstantially.It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions\nwell brought in.The vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scenes\nof which he had been a spectator, or in which he had been an actor,\nrendered his narrations the more animated, his conversation more\nendearing.Politics were his favorite subject\nHe never spoke on religious subjects, unless pressed to it, and never\ndisputed about such matters.He could not speak French: he could\nunderstand it tolerably well when spoken to him, and he understood it\nwhen on paper perfectly well.He never went to the theatre: never spoke\non dramatic subjects.He did\nnot like it: he said it was not a serious thing, but a sport of the\nmind, which often had not common sense.His common reading was the\naffairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him; not a political\ndiscussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot; and, as he\nwas always on the watch, he was always ready to write.Hence all his\npamphlets have been popular and powerful.He wrote with composure and\nsteadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius.If, for an\ninstant, he stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who\nlistens.The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his\ncontemplative recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which\nmakes itself heard in the heart.[It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death\nof Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the Title of: The Life of Thomas\nPaine, by Cheethatn.In this libel my character was calumniated.I cited\nthe Author before the Criminal Court of New York, He was tried and in\nspite of all his manoeuvres, he was found guilty.--M.This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame\nBonneville.Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer\nof Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply\njustified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the\nCobbett papers.APPENDIX B. THE HALL MANUSCRIPTS\n\nIn 1785, John Hall, an able mechanician and admirable man, emigrated\nfrom Leicester, England, to Philadelphia, He carried letters to Paine,\nwho found him a man after his own heart I am indebted to his relatives,\nDr.Dutton Steele of Philadelphia and the Misses Steele, for Hall\'s\njournals, which extend over many years.It will be seen that the papers\nare of historical importance apart from their records concerning Paine.Hall\'s entries of his daily intercourse with Paine, which he never\ndreamed would see the light, represent a portraiture such as has rarely\nbeen secured of any character in history.The extent already reached by\nthis work compels me to omit much that would impress the reader with the\nexcellent work of John Hall himself, who largely advanced ironwork in\nNew Jersey, and whose grave at Flemmington, surrounded by those of the\nrelatives that followed him, and near the library and workshop he left,\nmerits a noble monument."I went a day or two past with the Captain and his lady to see the\nexhibition of patriotic paintings.Paine the author of Common Sense is\namongst them.He went from England (had been usher to a school) on board\nthe same vessel that our Captain [Coltman] went in last time; their\nacquaintance then commenced and has continued ever since.He resides\nnow in Bordentown in the Jerseys, and it is probable that I may see him\nbefore it be long as when he comes to town the Captain says he is\nsure to call on him.It is supposed the various States have made his\ncircumstances easy--General Washington, said if they did not provide for\nhim he would himself.I think his services were as useful as the sword."Pain by his Boy, informing us\nof his coming this day.Kerbright\n[Kirkbride], and another gentleman came to our door in a waggon.Pain told us a tale of the Indians, he being at a\nmeeting of them with others to settle some affairs in 1776.Pain\'s--not to give a deciding opinion between\ntwo persons you are in friendship with, lest you lose one by it; whilst\ndoing that between two persons, your supposed enemies, may make one your\nfriend.With much pain drawd the Board in at Hanna\'s chamber window to\nwork Mr.I pinned 6 more arches together which makes\nthe whole 9.Pain gives me some wine and water as I\nwas very dry.[The December journal is mainly occupied with mention of Paine\'s\nvisitors Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr.Rush, Tench Francis, Robert\nMorris, Rittenhouse, Redman.A rubber of whist in which Paine won is\nmentioned.]Franklin today;\nstaid till after tea in the evening.They tried the burning of our\ncandles by blowing a gentle current through them.The draught of air is prevented by passing through a cold\ntube of tallow.The tin of the new lamp by internal reflections is\nheated and causes a constant current This is the Doctor\'s conjecture.[Concerning Paine\'s candle see i., p.We sent to all the places we could\nsuppose him to be at and no tidings of him.We became very unhappy\nfearing his political enemies should have shown him foul play.Went to\nbed at 10 o.c, and about 2 o.c.Before 7 o\'c a brother saint-maker came with a model of\nmachine to drive boats against stream.* He had communicated his scheme\nto H. who had made alterations and a company had taken it and refused\nsaint-maker partnership.He would fain have given it to Mr.Paine or me,\nbut I a stranger refused and Mr.Paine had enough hobbys of his own.Paine pointed out a mode to simplify his apparatus greatly.This saint-maker is John\n     Fitch, the "H."This entry is of\n     much interest.The first steamer seems\n     to have gone begging!Paine asked me to go and see Indian Chiefs of Sennaka\nNation, I gladly assented.Paine wished\nto see him and made himself known to him by past remembrance as Common\nSense, and was introduced into the room, addressed them as "brothers"\nand shook hands cordially Mr.Colonel Kirkbride is the gentleman in whose\nfamily I am.My patron [Paine] is likewise a boarder and makes his home\nhere I am diligently employed in Saint making, now in Iron that I had\nbefore finished in wood, with some improvements, but you may come and\nsee what it is.Skepticism and Credulity are as general here as\nelsewhere, for what I see.In this town is a Quaker meeting and one of\nanother class--I suppose of the Baptist cast--And a person in town a\nTailor by trade that goes about a-soulmending on Sundays to various\nplaces, as most necessary, or I suppose advantageous, to himself; for by\none trade or the other he has built himself a very elegant frame house\nin this town.This man\'s way to Heaven is somewhat different to the\nother.I am informed he makes publick dippings &c.

and bought by a friend of\nmine called Common Sense--Who I believe had no idea of purchasing it\nwhen he came there.He took Jo to Bordentown with him that night and\nthey came to look at it the next day; then Jo went into the Jerseys\nto find a countryman named Burges but was disappointed Came back to\nBordentown and on Saturday looked all over Mr.Paine\'s purchase along\nwith him and believes it bought well worth money.Paine told us an anecdote of a French noble\'s applying to\nDr.Franklin, as the Americans had put away their King, and that nation\nhaving formerly chosen a King from Normandy, he offered his service and\nwished him to lay his letter before Congress.Paine observed that\nBritain is the most expensive government in the world.She gives a King\na million a year and falls down and worships him.Last night he brought me in my room a pair of warm cloth\novershoes as feel very comfortable this morning Had a wooden pot stove\nstand betwixt my feet by Mr.Paine\'s desire and found it kept my feet\nwarm.As soon as breakfast was over mounted Button [Paine\'s\nhorse] and set off for Philadelphia.Paine $120 in gold\nand silver.Day was devoted to rivetting the bars, and\npunching the upper bar for the bannisters [of the bridge].Kirkbride\nand Polly went to hear a David Jones preach a rhodomontade sermon about\nthe Devil, Mary Magdalen, and against deists, etc.This day employed in raising and putting on the abutments\nagain and fitting them.The smith made the nuts of screws to go easier.Then set the ribs at proper distance, and after dinner I and Jackaway [?\n]put on some temporary pieces on the frame of wood to hold it straight,\nand when Mr.Pain came they then tied it on its wooden frame with strong\ncords.I then saw that it had bulged full on one side and hollow on the\nother.I told him of it, and he said it was done by me--I denied that\nand words rose high.I at length swore by God that it was straight when\nI left it, he replied as positively the contrary, and I think myself ill\nused in this affair.We arrived\nin town about 5 o.clock took our bags to Capt Coltmans, and then went\ndown to Dr.Franklin\'s, and helped unload the bridge.Paine called\non me; gave us an anecdote of Dr.Paine asking him of\nthe value of any new European publication; he had not been informed of\nany of importance.There were some religious posthumous anecdotes of\nDoctor Johnson, of resolves he had made and broken though he had prayed\nfor power and strength to keep them; which showed the Doctor said that\nhe had not much interest there.And such things had better be suppressed\nas nobody had anything to do betwixt God and man.Went with Glentworth to see the Bridge at Dr.Rittenhouse; returned with them\nand helped move it for all three to stand upon, and then turned it to\nexamine.Rittenhouse has no doubt of its strength and sufficiency\nfor the Schuylkill, but wished to know what quantity of iron [it would\nrequire,] as he seemed to think it too expensive.The Bank bill called but postponed\nuntil tomorrow.Pain\'s letter read, and leave given to exhibit the\nBridge at the State House to be viewed by the members.Pain, who told me Donnalson had been to see and [stand]\nupon his Bridge, and admitted its strength and powers.Then took a walk\nbeyond Vine street, and passed by the shop where the steamboat apparatus\nis.Pain at our house, and talking on the Bank affair brought on a\ndispute between Mr.Pain and the Captain [Coltman] in which words were\nvery high.A reflection from Captain C. on publications in favour of the\nBank having lost them considerable, he [Paine] instantly took that as a\nreflection on himself, and swore by G--d, let who would, it was a lie.I then left the room and went up stairs.They quarrelled a considerable\ntime, but at length parted tolerably coolly.Dinner being ready I went\ndown; but the Captain continued talking about politics and the Bank, and\nwhat he thought the misconduct of Mr.Pain in his being out and in with\nthe several parties.Pain in some things\nrelating thereto, by saying it was good sense in changing his ground\nwhen any party was going wrong,--and that he seemed to delight in\ndifficulties, in Mechanics particularly, and was pleased in them.The\nCaptain grew warm, and said he knew now he could not eat his dinner.[Here followed a sharp personal quarrel between Hall and Coltman.]Paine came in and wished me to be assisting in carrying\nthe model to the State House.Franklin\'s and fetched the\nBridge to the Committee Room.Our Saint I have assisted in moving to the State House and\nthere placed in their Committee room, as by a letter addressed to this\nSpeaker they admitted.And by the desire of my patron (who is not an\nearly riser) I attended to give any information to inquiries until\nhe came.And then I was present when the Assembly with their Speaker\ninspected it and many other persons as philosophers, Mechanics Statesmen\nand even Tailors.I observed their sentiments and opinions of it were as\ndifferent as their features.The philosopher said it would add new\nlight to the great utility.And the tailor (for it is an absolute truth)\nremarked it cut a pretty figure.It is yet to be laid (or by the by\nstand) before the Council of State.Then the Philosophical Society and\nall the other Learned Bodies in this city.And then to be canonised by\nan Act of State which is solicited to incorporate a body of men to adopt\nand realise or Brobdinag this our Lilliputian handywork, that is now 13\nfeet long on a Scale of one to 24.And then will be added another to the\nworld\'s present Wonders.Pain called in and left me the intended Act of Assembly\nfor a Bridge Company, who are to subscribe $33,330 50/99 then are to\nbe put in possession of the present Bridge and premises to answer the\ninterest of their money until they erect a new one; and after they have\nerected a new one, and the money arising from it amounts to more\nthan pays interest, it is to become a fund to pay off the principal\nstockholders, and then the Bridge to become free.Pain called in;\nI gave him my Bill--told him I had charged one day\'s work and a pair of\ngloves.Paine\'s boy called on time to [inquire] of the money\nspent.Paine called this evening; told me of his being with Dr.Franklin and about the chess player, or Automaton, and that the Dr.Paine has had several\nvisitors, as Mr.Logan, &c.\n\nSunday April 16th Prepared to attend Mr.Paine\'s horse and chair came, mounted and drove through a barren sandy\ncountry arrived at Bordentown at half past one-o\'clock for dinner.This\nis the pleasantest situation I have seen in this country.Sitting in the house saw a chair pass down the street\nwith a red coat on, and going out after it believed it to be Mr.Paine,\nso followed him up to Collins\'s, where he was enquiring where I boarded.I just then called to him, and went with him to Whight\'s Tavern, and\nthere he paid me the money I had laid down for him.He is now going\nfor England by way of France in the French packet which sails the 25th\ninstant.He asked me to take a ride, and as the stage was not come in\nand he going the road I gladly took the opportunity, as I could return\non meeting the stage.On the journey he told me of the Committee\'s\nproceedings on Bridges and Sewers; anecdotes of Dr.Franklin, who had\nsent a letter by him to the president, or some person, to communicate to\nthe Society of Civil Architects, who superintend solely over bridges in\nFrance.The model is packed up to go with him.The Doctor, though full\nof employ from the Vice President being ill, and the numerous visitors\non State business, and others that his fame justly procures him,\ncould hardly be supposed to pay great attention to trifles; but as he\nconsiders Mr.Paine his adopted political Son he would endeavor to\nwrite by him to his friends, though Mr.Paine did not press, for reasons\nabove.In 2 or 3 days he sent him up to Bordentown no less than a dozen\nletters to his acquaintance in France.--He told me many anecdotes of the\nDoctor, relating to national and political concerns, and observations of\nmany aged and sensible men of his acquaintance in that country.And the\ntreaty that he the Doctor made with the late King of Prussia by adding\nan article that, should war ever break out, (though never a probability\nof it) Commerce should be left free.The Doctor said he showed it to the\nFrench minister, Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was such as he\nwould make even with England, though he knew they would not,--they were\nso fond of robbing and plundering.And the Doctor had gathered a hint\nfrom a Du Quesney that no nation could properly expect to gain by\nendeavoring to suppress his neighbor, for riches were to be gained from\namongst the rich and not from poor neighbors; and a National reciprocity\nwas as much necessary as a domestic one, or [inter] national trade as\nnecessary to be free as amongst the people of a country.Such and many\nmore hints passed in riding 2 or 3 miles, until we met the stage.I then\nshook hands and wished him a good voyage and parted.Letter from Flemmington, N. J., May 16, 1788, to John Coltman,\nLeicester, England:\n\n"Friend John: Tell that disbelieving sceptical Infidel thy Father that\nhe has wounded my honor, What!Bought the Coat at a rag shop--does he\nthink I would palm such a falsity both upon Gray and Green heads!did\nnot I send you word it was General Washington\'s.And does he think I\nshall slanderously brook such a slanderous indignity--No!I tell him\nthe first Ink that meanders from my pen, which shall be instantly on my\nsetting foot on Brittains Isle, shall be to call him to account.I \'ll\nhaul out his Callous Leaden soul with its brother!"In the late revolution the provincial army lying near Princeton New\nJersey one Sunday General Washington and Common Sense each in their\nchairs rode down there to Meeting Common Sense put up his at a friend\'s\none Mrs.Morgan\'s and pulling off his great coat put it in the care of\na servant man, and as I remember he was of the pure Irish Extraction;\nhe walked then to meeting and then slipped off with said great coat and\nsome plate of Mr.On their return they found what had been done\nin their absence and relating it to the General his answer was it was\nnecessary to watch as well as pray--but told him he had two and would\nlend or give him one--and that is the Coat I sent and the fact as\nrelated to me and others in public by said [Common Sense.]Nor do I\nbelieve that Rome or the whole Romish Church has a better attested\nmiracle in her whole Catalogue than the above--though I dont wish to\ndeem it a miracle, nor do I believe there is any miracle upon record for\nthese 18 hundred years so true as that being General Washington\'s great\ncoat.--I, labouring hard for said Common Sense at Bordentown, the said\ncoat was hung up to keep snow out of the room.I often told him I should\nexpect that for my pains, but he never would say I should; but having\na chest there I took care and locked it up when I had finished my work,\nand sent it to you.So far are these historical facts--Maybe sometime\nhence I may collect dates and periods to them--But why should they be\ndisputed?has not the world adopted as true a-many affairs without date\nand of less moment than this, and even pay what is called a holy regard\nto them?"If you communicate this to your Father and he feels a compunction for\nthe above crime and will signify the same by letter, he will find I\nstrictly adhere to the precepts of Christianity and shall forgive.--If\nnot------\n\n"My best wishes to you all,\n\n"John Hall."John\nColtman\'s, Shambles Lane, Leicester, England.""My old Friend: I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear\nthat our Friends on the other side the water are well.The Bridge has\nbeen put up, but being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now\ntaken down.The first rib as an experiment was erected between two steel\nfurnaces which supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of\niron, was ninety feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded\nwith six tons of iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.At present\nI am engaged on my political Bridge.I shall bring out a new work\n(Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year.It will produce\nsomething one way or other.I see the tide is yet the wrong way, but\nthere is a change of sentiment beginning.I have so far got the ear of\nJohn Bull that he will read what I write--which is more than ever was\ndone before to the same extent.Rights of Man has had the greatest\nrun of anything ever published in this country, at least of late\nyears--almost sixteen thousand has gone off--and in Ireland above forty\nthousand--besides the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now\ngone to Scotland by desire from some of the [friends] there.I have been\napplied to from Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but\nI intend, after the next work has had its run among those who will have\nhandsome printed books and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand\ncopies of each work and distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I\ndo not at present talk of, because it will alarm the wise mad folks at\nSt.Jefferson who mentioned\nthe great run it has had there.It has been attacked by John Adams, who\nhas brought an host about his ears from all parts of the Continent.Jefferson has sent me twenty five different answers to Adams who wrote\nunder the signature of Publicola.A letter is somewhere in the city for\nme from Mr.I hope to receive it in a few days.I shall be glad at all times to see, or hear from you.Write to me\n(under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N: 166 Fleet Street, before\nyou leave Leicester.How far is it from thence to Rotherham?"P.

PORTRAITS OF PAINE\n\nAt the age of thirty Paine was somewhat stout, and very athletic; but\nafter his arrival in America (1774) he was rather slender.His height\nwas five feet, nine inches.He had a prominent nose, somewhat like that\nof Ralph Waldo Emerson.It may have impressed Bonaparte, who insisted,\nit is said, that a marshal must have a large nose.Paine\'s mouth was\ndelicate, his chin also; he wore no whiskers or beard until too feeble\nwith age to shave.His forehead was lofty and unfurrowed; his head\nlong, the occiput feeble.His complexion was ruddy,--thoroughly English.Charles Lee, during the American revolution, described him as "the man\nwho has genius in his eyes;" Carlyle quotes from Foster an observation\non the brilliancy of Paine\'s eyes, as he sat in the French Convention.His figure, as given in an early French portrait, is shapely; its\nelegance was often remarked.A year or so after his return to America he\nis shown in a contemporary picture as somewhat stout again, if one may\njudge by the face.This was probably a result of insufficient exercise,\non which he much depended.He was an expert horseman, and, in health, an\nunwearied walker.He loved music, and could join well in a chorus.There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a\ndeath-mask, a bust, and the profile copied in this work from a seal used\non the release at Lewes, elsewhere cited (i., p.That gives some\nidea of the head and face at the age of thirty-five.I have a picture\nsaid to be that of Paine in his youth, but the dress is an anachronism.The earliest portrait of Paine was painted by Charles Willson Peale, in\nPhiladelphia, probably in some early year of the American Revolution,\nfor Thomas Brand Hollis, of London,--the benefactor of Harvard\nUniversity, one of whose halls bears his name.The same artist painted\nanother portrait of Paine, now badly placed in Independence Hall.There\nmust have been an early engraving from one of Peale\'s pictures, for John\nHall writes October 31, 1786: "A print of Common Sense, if any of my\nfriends want one, may be had by sending to the printshops in London,\nbut they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."* The Hollis\nportrait was engraved in London, 1791, underlined "by Peel [sic] of\nPhiladelphia," and published, July 25th, by J. Ridgway, York Street, St.Paine holds an open book bearing the words, "Rights of\nMan," where Peale probably had "Common Sense."On a table with inkstand\nand pens rests Paine\'s right elbow, the hand supporting his chin.The\nfull face appears--young, handsome, gay; the wig is frizzed, a bit of\nthe queue visible.In all of the original portraits of Paine his dress\nis neat and in accordance with fashion, but in this Hollis picture it\nis rather fine: the loose sleeves are ornamentally corded, and large\nwristbands of white lace fall on the cuffs.The only engraving I have found with\n     "Toia" was published in London in 1800.Can there be a\n     portrait lost under some other name?While Paine and Jefferson were together in Paris (1787) Paine wrote him\na note, August 18th, in which he says: "The second part of your letter,\nconcerning taking my picture, I must feel as an honor done to me, not\nas a favor asked of me--but in this, as in other matters, I am at the\ndisposal of your friendship."As Jefferson does not appear to have\npossessed such a portrait, the request was probably made through him.I\nincline to identify this portrait with an extremely interesting one, now\nin this country, by an unknown artist.It is one of twelve symmetrical\nportraits of revolutionary leaders,--the others being Marat,\nRobespierre, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Danton, Brissot, Petion, Camille\nDesmoulins, Billaud de Varennes, Gensonne, Clermont Tonnere.These\npictures were reproduced in cheap woodcuts and distributed about France\nduring the Revolution.Lowry, of\nSouth Carolina, and brought to Charleston during the Revolution.At\nthe beginning of the civil war they were buried in leaden cases at\nWilliamstown, South Carolina.At the end of the war they were conveyed\nto Charleston, where they remained, in the possession of a Mrs.Cole,\nuntil purchased by their present owner, Mr.Alfred Ames Howlett, of\nSyracuse, New York.As Mirabeau is included, the series must have been\nbegun at an early phase of the revolutionary agitation.The face of\nPaine here strongly resembles that in Independence Hall.The picture\nis about two feet high; the whole figure is given, and is dressed in an\nelegant statesmanlike fashion, with fine cravat and silk stockings from\nthe knee.The table and room indicate official position, but it is the\nsame room as in nine of the other portraits.It is to be hoped that\nfurther light may be obtained concerning these portraits.Well-dressed also, but notably unlike the preceding, is the "Bonneville\nPaine," one of a celebrated series of two hundred engraved portraits,\nthe publication of which in quarto volumes was begun in Paris in\n1796.et sculpsit" is its whole history.Paine is\ndescribed in it as "Ex Depute a la Convention Nationale," which would\nmean strictly some time between his expulsion from that assembly\nin December, 1793, and his recall to it a year later.It could not,\nhowever, have been then taken, on account of Paine\'s imprisonment and\nillness.It was probably made by F. Bonneville when Paine had gone to\nreside with Nicolas Bonneville in the spring of 1797.It is an admirable\npicture in every way, but especially in bringing out the large and\nexpressive eyes.The hair is here free and flowing; the dress identical\nwith that of the portrait by Jarvis in this work.The best-known picture of Paine is that painted by his friend George\nRomney, in 1792.I have inquired through London _Notes and Queries_\nafter the original, which long ago disappeared, and a claimant turned up\nin Birmingham, England; but in this the hand holds a book, and Sharp\'s\nengraving shows no hand.The large engraving by W. Sharp was published April 20, 1793, and the\nsmaller in 1794.A reproduction by Illman were a fit frontispiece for\nCheetham (what satirical things names are sometimes), but ought not\nto have got into Gilbert Vale\'s popular biography of Paine.That and\na reproduction by Wright in the Mendum edition of Paine\'s works, have\nspread through this country something little better than a caricature;\nand one Sweden has subjected Truelove\'s edition, in England, to a\nlike misfortune.Paine\'s friends, Rickman, Constable, and others, were\nsatisfied by the Romney picture, and I have seen in G. J. Holyoake\'s\nlibrary a proof of the large engraving, with an inscription on the back\nby Paine, who presented it to Rickman.It is the English Paine, in all\nhis vigor, and in the thick of his conflict with Burke, but, noble as\nit is, has not the gentler and more poetic expression which Bonneville\nfound in the liberated prisoner surrounded by affectionate friends.Romney and Sharp were both well acquainted with Paine.A picturesque Paine is one engraved for Baxter\'s "History of England,"\nand published by Symonds, July 2, 1796.Dressed with great elegance,\nPaine stands pointing to a scroll in his left hand, inscribed "Rights\nof Man."Above his head, on a frame design, a pen lies on a roll marked\n"Equality."The face is handsome and the likeness good\n\nA miniature by H. Richards is known to me only as engraved by K.\nMackenzie, and published March 31, 1800, by G. Gawthorne, British\nLibrary, Strand, London.It is the only portrait that has beneath it\n"Tom Paine."It represents Paine as rather stout, and the face broad.It is powerful, but the least pleasing of the portraits.The picture in\nVale resembles this more than the Romney it professes to copy.I have in my possession a wood engraving of Paine, which gives no trace\nof its source or period.It is a vigorous profile, which might have\nbeen made in London during the excitement over the "Rights of Man," for\npopular distribution.It has no wig, and shows the head extraordinarily\nlong, and without much occiput It is pre-eminently the English radical\nleader.Before speaking of Jarvis\' great portrait of Paine, I mention a later\none by him which Mr.William Erving, of New York, has added to my\ncollection.It would appear to have been circulated at the time of his\ndeath.The lettering beneath, following a facsimile autograph, is: "J.\nW. Jarvis, pinx.J- R. Ames, del.--L\'Homme des Deux Mondes.Born\nat Thetford, England, Jan.Died at Greenwich, New\nYork, June 8, 1809."Above the cheap wood-cut is: "A tribute to Paine."On the right, at the top, is a globe, showing the outlines of the\nAmericas, France, England, and Africa.It is supported by the wing of a\ndove with large olive-branch.On the left upper corner is an open book\ninscribed: "Rights of Man.Crisis": supported by a scroll\nwith "Doing justice, loving mercy.From this book rays\nbreak out and illumine the globe opposite.A lower corner shows the\nbalances, and the liberty-cap on a pole, the left being occupied by the\nUnited States flag and that of France.Beneath are the broken chain,\ncrown, sword, and other emblems of oppression.A frame rises showing a\nplumb line, at the top of which the key of the Bastille is crossed by\na pen, on Paine\'s breast.The portrait is surrounded by a "Freedom\'s\nWreath" in which are traceable the floral emblems of all nations.The\nwreath is bound with a fascia, on which appear, by twos, the following\nnames: "Washington, Monroe; Jefferson, Franklin; J. Stewart, E. Palmer;\nBarlow, Rush; M. Wollstone-craft, M. B. Bonneville; Clio Rickman, J.\nHome Tooke; Lafayette, Brissot."The portrait of Paine represents him with an unusually full face,\nas compared with earlier pictures, and a most noble and benevolent\nexpression.The white cravat and dress are elegant.What has become of\nthe original of this second picture by the elder Jarvis?It might easily\nhave fallen to some person who might not recognize it as meant for\nPaine, though to one who has studied his countenance it conveys the\nimpression of what he probably would have been at sixty-eight.About two\nyears later a drawing was made of Paine by William Constable, which I\nsaw at the house of his nephew, Dr.Clair J. Grece, Redhill, England.It\nreveals the ravages of age, but conveys a vivid impression of the man\'s\npower.After Paine\'s death Jarvis took a cast of his face.Laurence\nHutton has had for many years this death-mask which was formerly in the\nestablishment of Fowler and Wells, the phrenologists, and probably used\nby George Combe in his lectures.This mask has not the large nose of the\nbust; but that is known to have been added afterwards.The bust is in\nthe New York Historical Society\'s rooms.In an article on Paine in the\n_Atlantic Monthly_ (1856) it was stated that this bust had to be hidden\nby the Historical Society to prevent its injury by haters of Paine.Robertson, of London, in his "Thomas Paine, an\nInvestigation."Kelby, of that Society, that the\nstatement is unfounded.The Society has not room to exhibit its entire\ncollection, and the bust of Paine was for some time out of sight, but\nfrom no such reason as that stated, still less from any prejudice.The\nface is that of Paine in extreme dilapidation, and would be a dismal\nmisrepresentation if shown in a public place.Before me are examples of all the portraits I have mentioned (except\nthat in Birmingham), and I have observed contemporary representations of\nPaine in caricatures or in apotheosis of fly-leaves.Comparative studies\nconvince me that the truest portrait of Paine is that painted by John\nWesley Jarvis in 1803, and now in possession of Mr.J. H. Johnston, of\nNew York.The picture from which our frontispiece is taken appeared to\nbe a replica, of somewhat later date, the colors being fresher, but an\ninscription on the back says "Charles W. Jarvis, pinxit, July, 1857."From this perfect duplicate Clark Mills made his portrait-bust of Paine\nnow in the National Museum at Washington, but it has not hitherto been\nengraved.Alas, that no art can send out to the world what colors only\ncan convey,--the sensibility, the candor, the spirituality, transfusing\nthe strong features of Thomas Paine.As I have sat at my long task, now\ndrawn to a close, the face there on the wall has seemed to be alive, now\nflushed with hope, now shadowed with care, the eyes greeting me daily,\nthe firm mouth assigning some password--Truth, Justice.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life Of Thomas Paine, Vol."I\'m very sorry, Ginger," ses Bill, as \'e took a little over eight pounds\nout of Ginger\'s pocket."I\'ll pay you back one o\' these days, if I can.If you\'d got a rope round your neck same as I \'ave you\'d do the same as\nI\'ve done."He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked \'im up.Ginger\'s face was red with passion and \'is eyes starting out of his \'ead."Eight and six is fifteen," ses Bill, and just then he \'eard somebody\ncoming up the stairs.Ginger \'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came\ninto the room \'e tried all \'e could to attract \'is attention by rolling\n\'is \'ead from side to side."Why, \'as Ginger gone to bed?""He\'s all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a \'eadache."Peter stood staring at the bed, and then \'e pulled the clothes off and\nsaw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at \'im to undo him."I \'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill."I wanted some more money to escape\nwith, and \'e wouldn\'t lend it to me.I \'aven\'t got as much as I want\nnow.You just came in in the nick of time.Another minute and you\'d ha\'\nmissed me."Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,\n"but I\'ve \'ad my pocket picked; that\'s wot I came back for, to get some\nfrom Ginger.""You see \'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three\nmen laid \'old of me and took every farthing I\'d got.""Well, I can\'t rob you, then," ses Bill, catching \'old of \'im."Whoever\'s money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o\' Peter\'s\npocket, "it can\'t be yours.Now, if you make another sound I\'ll knock\nyour \'ead off afore I tie you up.""Don\'t tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling."I can\'t trust you," ses Bill, dragging \'im over to the washstand and\ntaking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill \'ad done \'im\n\'e put \'im in alongside o\' Ginger and covered \'em up, arter first tying\nboth the gags round with some string to prevent \'em slipping."Mind, I\'ve only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o\' the bed;\n"but I must say, mates, I\'m disappointed in both of you.If either of\nyou \'ad \'ad the misfortune wot I\'ve \'ad, I\'d have sold the clothes off my\nback to \'elp you.And I wouldn\'t \'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then \'e patted both their\n\'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and\nthen they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to\ntalk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but \'e\nmight as well \'ave tried to wriggle out of \'is skin.The worst of it was\nthey couldn\'t make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter\nRusset leaned over \'im and tried to work \'is gag off by rubbing it up\nagin \'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged\nPeter with his \'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till\nthey\'d both got splitting \'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair\nand lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He\nsat there quite patient till twelve o\'clock and then walked slowly \'ome,\nwondering wot \'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to \'ear \'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into\nthe room, in the darkness, him an\' Peter Russet started shaking their bed\nin a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill\ncarrying on agin, and \'e was out o\' that door and \'arf-way downstairs\nafore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten\nminutes, and then, as nothing \'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on\ntiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made\nthat bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready\nto dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn\'t know whether Bill\nwas dying or whether \'e \'ad got delirium trimmings.All \'e did know was\nthat \'e wasn\'t going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and\nwent downstairs agin, feeling in \'is pocket for a match, and, not finding\none, \'e picked out the softest stair \'e could find and, leaning his \'ead\nagin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair \'e could find."]It was about six o\'clock when \'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was\nstiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light \'e stepped\nsoftly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for\n\'im, and as he peeped in \'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their\n\'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with\nbandages.He was that startled \'e nearly screamed, and then \'e stepped\ninto the room and stared at \'em as if he couldn\'t believe \'is eyes."Wot d\'ye mean by making sights of\nyourselves like that?\'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their \'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam\nsee wot was the matter with \'em.Fust thing \'e did was to pull out \'is\nknife and cut Ginger\'s gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call\n\'im every name \'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, \'arf crying with rage."You wait till I\nget my \'ands loose and I\'ll pull you to pieces.The idea o\' leaving us\nlike this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet\'s gag, and Peter Russet\ncalled \'im \'arf a score o\' names without taking breath."And when Ginger\'s finished I\'ll \'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my \'ands on\nyou."Sam didn\'t answer \'em; he shut up \'is knife with a click and then \'e sat\nat the foot o\' the bed on Ginger\'s feet and looked at \'em.It wasn\'t the\nfust time they\'d been rude to \'im, but as a rule he\'d \'ad to put up with\nit.He sat and listened while Ginger swore \'imself faint."That\'ll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the\nbedclothes over your \'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot\nit\'s all about."Peter told \'im, arter fust calling \'im some more names, because Ginger\nwas past it, and when \'e\'d finished old Sam said \'ow surprised he was\nat them for letting Bill do it, and told \'em how they ought to \'ave\nprevented it.He sat there talking as though \'e enjoyed the sound of \'is\nown voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot\nsorrow it caused their friends.Twice he \'ad to throw the bedclothes\nover their \'eads because o\' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said \'ow surprised he was at them for letting\nBill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn\'t do it.Arter\nwot you\'ve said--and arter wot I\'ve said--my life wouldn\'t be safe.Besides which, you\'d want to go shares in my money."He took up \'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about \'arf an\nhour arterward the landlady\'s \'usband came up and set \'em free.As soon\nas they\'d got the use of their legs back they started out to look for\nSam, but they didn\'t find \'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they\nnever set eyes on \'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill\'s Lapse, by W.W.And it\'s got so bad that nobody now has\nthe courage to offer, a refusal is so certain.(_Sobs._) Or else I\'m\nsure that gentleman who danced the whole evening with me a month ago at\nLady Thornton\'s--\n\nJANE.Yes, miss: I\'ve heard you mention him often.He was dying to offer himself, I\'m sure, from the way he\nlooked at me.(_Weeps._) O\nJane, how tedious, how tedious life is!(_Enter SINGLETON CODDLE, door R._)\n\nCODDLE (_book in hand, from which he reads._) "Deafness is one of the\nmost distressing afflictions which can attack mankind."JANE (_shouts in his ear_).(_Holds it before\nhis eyes._)\n\nCODDLE.(_Takes letter._) You\nneedn\'t stick letters into my eye, Jane: you only need tell me you have\nthem.(_Sits._)\n\nEGLANTINE.If I could only manage to\npeep over his shoulder!He can\'t never hear his\nown voice, and don\'t know but he\'s reading to himself.He thinks out\nloud too;

and therefore,\nplucking the crow neatly, he let him go to show himself to his\ncompanions.This proved so effectual a punishment, that he was\nafterwards left to eat his food in peace.""I don\'t see," said Minnie, thoughtfully, "how a monkey could ever think\nof such a way.""It certainly does show a great deal of sagacity," responded the lady,\n"and a great deal of cunning in carrying out his plan.""I hope there are ever so many anecdotes, mamma.""Yes, my dear," she said, cheerfully,\n"there are quite a number; some of them seem to be very amusing, but I\nhave only time to read you one more to-day."Guthrie gives an amusing account of a monkey named Jack."Seeing his master and friends drinking whiskey with great apparent\nrelish, he took the opportunity, when he thought he was unseen, to empty\ntheir half-filled glasses; and while they were roaring with laughter, he\nbegan to hop, skip, and jump."The next day, his master wanted to repeat the experiment, but found\nJack had not recovered from the effects of his dissipation.He commanded\nhim to come to the table; but the poor fellow put his hand to his head,\nand not all their endeavors could induce him to taste another drop all\nhis life."Jack became a thorough teetotaller."Minnie had a cousin Frank, the son of Mr.He was three years\nolder than Minnie, and was full of life and frolic.At one time he came to visit Minnie; and fine fun indeed they had with\nthe pets, the monkey being his especial favorite.Every day some new experiment was to be tried with Jacko, who, as Frank\ndeclared, could be taught any thing that they wished.One time, he took\nthe little fellow by the chain for a walk, Minnie gayly running by his\nside, and wondering what her cousin was going to do.On their way to the barn, they met Leo, who at once began to bark\nfuriously."That will never do, my brave fellow," exclaimed the boy; "for we want\nyou to turn horse, and take Jacko to ride."urged Minnie, almost\ncrying."But I mean to make them good friends," responded the lad."Here, you\ntake hold of the chain, and I will coax the dog to be quiet while I put\nJacko on his back."This was not so easy as he had supposed; for no amount of coaxing or\nflattery would induce Leo to be impressed into this service.He hated\nthe monkey, and was greatly disgusted at his appearance as he hopped,\nfirst on Frank\'s shoulder, and then to the ground, his head sticking out\nof his little red jacket, and his face wearing a malicious grin.Finding they could not succeed in this, they went into the stable to\nvisit Star, when, with a quick motion, Jacko twitched the chain from\nMinnie\'s hand, and running up the rack above the manger, began to laugh\nand chatter in great glee.His tail, which had now fully healed, was of great use to him on this\noccasion, when, to Minnie\'s great surprise, he clung with it to the bar\nof the rack, and began to swing himself about.[Illustration: JACKO RUNNING AWAY."I heard of a monkey once," exclaimed Frank, laughing merrily, "who made\ngreat use of his tail.If a nut or apple were thrown to him which fell\nbeyond his reach, he would run to the full length of his chain, turn his\nback, then stretch out his tail, and draw toward him the coveted\ndelicacy.""Let\'s see whether Jacko would do so," shouted Minnie, greatly excited\nwith the project.There he goes up the\nhay mow, the chain dangling after him.""If we don\'t try to catch him, he\'ll come quicker," said Minnie,\ngravely."I know another story about a monkey--a real funny one," added the boy."I don\'t know what his name was; but he used to sleep in the barn with\nthe cattle and horses.I suppose monkeys are always cold here; at any\nrate, this one was; and when he saw the hostler give the horse a nice\nfeed of hay, he said to himself, \'What a comfortable bed that would make\nfor me!\'"When the man went away, he jumped into the hay and hid, and every time\nthe horse came near enough to eat, he sprang forward and bit her ears\nwith his sharp teeth."Of course, as the poor horse couldn\'t get her food, she grew very thin,\nand at last was so frightened that the hostler could scarcely get her\ninto the stall.Several times he had to whip her before she would enter\nit, and then she stood as far back as possible, trembling like a leaf."It was a long time before they found out what the matter was; and then\nthe monkey had to take a whipping, I guess.""If his mother had been there, she would have whipped him," said Minnie,\nlaughing.The little girl then repeated what her mother had told her of the\ndiscipline among monkeys, at which he was greatly amused.All this time, they were standing at the bottom of the hay mow, and\nsupposed that Jacko was safe at the top; but the little fellow was more\ncunning than they thought.He found the window open near the roof, where\nhay was sometimes pitched in, and ran down into the yard as quick as\nlightning.The first they knew of it was when John called out from the barnyard,\n"Jacko, Jacko!It was a wearisome chase they had for the next hour, and at the end they\ncould not catch the runaway; but at last, when they sat down calmly in\nthe house, he stole back to his cage, and lay there quiet as a lamb.Minnie\'s face was flushed with her unusual exercise, but in a few\nminutes she grew very pale, until her mother became alarmed.After a few\ndrops of lavender, however, she said she felt better, and that if Frank\nwould tell her a story she should be quite well."That I will," exclaimed the boy, eagerly."I know a real funny one;\nyou like funny stories--don\'t you?""Yes, when they\'re true," answered Minnie.A man was hunting, and he happened to kill a\nmonkey that had a little baby on her back.The little one clung so close\nto her dead mother, that they could scarcely get it away.When they\nreached the gentleman\'s house, the poor creature began to cry at\nfinding itself alone.All at once it ran across the room to a block,\nwhere a wig belonging to the hunter\'s father was placed, and thinking\nthat was its mother, was so comforted that it lay down and went to\nsleep."They fed it with goat\'s milk, and it grew quite contented, for three\nweeks clinging to the wig with great affection."The gentleman had a large and valuable collection of insects, which\nwere dried upon pins, and placed in a room appropriated to such\npurposes."One day, when the monkey had become so familiar as to be a favorite\nwith all in the family, he found his way to this apartment, and made a\nhearty breakfast on the insects."The owner, entering when the meal was almost concluded, was greatly\nenraged, and was about to chastise the animal, who had so quickly\ndestroyed the work of years, when he saw that the act had brought its\nown punishment.In eating the insects, the animal had swallowed the\npins, which very soon caused him such agony that he died.""I don\'t call the last part funny at all," said Minnie, gravely."But wasn\'t it queer for it to think the wig was its mother?"asked the\nboy, with a merry laugh."I don\'t think it could have had much sense to\ndo that.""But it was only a baby monkey then, Harry."Lee, "that Jacko got away from you?""He watched his chance, aunty, and twitched the chain away from Minnie.Now he\'s done it once, he\'ll try the game again, I suppose, he is so\nfond of playing us tricks."And true enough, the very next morning the lady was surprised at a visit\nfrom the monkey in her chamber, where he made himself very much at home,\npulling open drawers, and turning over the contents, in the hope of\nfinding some confectionery, of which he was extremely fond."Really," she exclaimed to her husband, "if Jacko goes on so, I shall\nbe of cook\'s mind, and not wish to live in the house with him."One day, Jacko observed nurse washing out some fine clothes for her\nmistress, and seemed greatly interested in the suds which she made in\nthe progress of her work.Watching his chance, he went to Mrs.Lee\'s room while the family were at\nbreakfast one morning, and finding some nice toilet soap on the marble\nwashstand, began to rub it on some fine lace lying on the bureau.After\na little exertion, he was delighted to find that he had a bowl full of\nnice, perfumed suds, and was chattering to himself in great glee, when\nAnn came in and spoiled his sport."You good for nothing, mischievous creature," she cried out, in sudden\nwrath, "I\'ll cure you of prowling about the house in this style."Giving him a cuff across his head with a shoe, "Go back to your cage,\nwhere you belong.""Jacko is really getting to be very troublesome," remarked the lady to\nher husband."I can\'t tell how much longer my patience with him will\nlast.""Would Minnie mourn very much if she were to lose him?""I suppose she would for a time; but then she has so many pets to take\nup her attention."Just then the child ran in, her eyes filled with tears, exclaiming,--\n\n"Father, does Jacko know any better?"Because," she went on, "I found him crouched down in his cage, looking\nvery sorry; and nurse says he ought to be ashamed of himself, cutting\nup such ridiculous capers.""I dare say he feels rather guilty," remarked Mr."He must be\ntaught better, or your mother will be tired of him."When her father had gone to the city, Minnie looked so grave that her\nmother, to comfort her, took the book and read her some stories.A few\nof them I will repeat to you."A lady was returning from India, in a ship on board of which there was\na monkey.She was a very mild, gentle creature, and readily learned any\nthing that was taught her.When she went to lie down at night, she made\nup her bed in imitation of her mistress, then got in and wrapped herself\nup neatly with the quilt.Sometimes she would wrap her head with a\nhandkerchief."When she did wrong, she would kneel and clasp her hands, seeming\nearnestly to ask to be forgiven.""That\'s a good story, mamma.""Yes, dear; and here is another.""A gentleman boarding with his wife at a hotel in Paris had a pet\nmonkey, who was very polite.One day his master met him going down\nstairs; and when the gentleman said \'good morning,\' the animal took off\nhis cap and made a very polite bow.Upon\nthis the monkey held out a square piece of paper.said the gentleman; \'your mistress\' gown is dusty.\'"Jack instantly took a small brush from his master\'s pocket, raised the\nhem of the lady\'s dress, cleaned it, and then did the same to his\nmaster\'s shoes, which were also dusty."When they gave him any thing to eat, he did not cram his pouches with\nit, but delicately and tidily devoured it; and when, as frequently\noccurred, strangers gave him money, he always put it in his master\'s\nhands.""Do you think, mamma, I could teach Jacko to do so?"inquired Minnie,\neagerly."I can\'t say, my dear; and indeed I think it would be hardly worth the\npains to spend a great deal of time in teaching him.He seems to learn\nquite fast enough by himself.Indeed, he is so full of tricks, and so\ntroublesome to cook in hiding her kitchen utensils, I am afraid we shall\nhave to put him in close confinement.""I had rather uncle Frank would carry him back to Africa," sighed the\nchild."Well, dear, I wouldn\'t grieve about it now.We must manage somehow till\nuncle Frank comes, and then perhaps he can tell us what to do."A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome\nthat the servants were constantly complaining.""That seems similar to our case," said the lady, smiling, as she\ninterrupted the reading."One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into\nthe next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately\nopen.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,\nlaces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away\nvigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be\nfound in the room."When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in\nspreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry."He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to\nhim, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case\nof the large kitchen clock."The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his\nplace of refuge when he was in disgrace."One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for\ndinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon\nmanaged to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam\nfowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and\nbegan plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the\nservants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in\nsuch a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Monkey was chained up, and soon died."Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,\n"I wonder how old that monkey was.""The book does not mention his age, my dear."I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;\nand then I said to myself, \'That one must have been young.\'""If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,"\nremarked the lady."His company does not begin to compensate for the\ntrouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and\ntractable.""And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?""I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better\nkind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny\ntricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I\nknew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I\nshould be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; "O, mamma, I wouldn\'t\nhave one of my pets killed for any thing."Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie\'s fate, but\nshe wisely said nothing.I don\'t want to think about such awful\nthings."The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently\nshe said, "Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but\nfirst I must explain to you what a sounding-board is."In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the\npulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was\nthought, assisted the minister\'s voice to be heard by all the\ncongregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my\ngrandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a\nsounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would\nfall on the minister\'s head and kill him."There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept\nin his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,\nwhich was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he\nwent out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out\nof sight, on his way to church."But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under\nhis arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the\nopportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,\nran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board."Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on\nthe congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle."The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much\nenjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the\nsounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was\nunconscious of his presence."When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with\nlaughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it\nhis duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action\nof his hands and arms."The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every\nmotion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the\ncountenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the\nmost solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity\nappear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,\nevery word being enforced by great energy of action."All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with\nardor and exactness."The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man\nand his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of\ncomposure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one\nof the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the\nirreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the\nmerriment."Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal\nstanding on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his\nmight, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly\nexasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey\nremoved, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to\nrecover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed."CHAPTER V.\n\nJACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching\nmice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to\ngood account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,\ndetermined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,\nand shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his\ncomfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every\nthing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and\nwell secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this\ntreatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup\ntureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over\nthe place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke\nshivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup\ntureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he\nbegan to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on\nthe upper shelf."There is something good," he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,\nraspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,\ndisappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in\na corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant\'s coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave\na scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a\nthousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her\nthat this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,\nwho began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his\nstomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his\nexcess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an\nexperiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new\nmischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,\nlaughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as\nhe said, "We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;\nbut you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.""Don\'t you know any stories of good monkeys, father?""I don\'t recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I\ncan find any for you."He opened the book, and then asked,--\n\n"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in\ntheir cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the\nanimal look wrinkled?""No, sir; I never heard about it."He puts his food in them, and keeps it there\ntill he wishes to devour it."There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;\nthat is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,\nand which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The\nfacility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the\nbranches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it\nmakes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,\nit is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it\nto swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.""I\'m sure, father," eagerly cried Minnie, "that Jacko has a prehensile\ntail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the\nhay mow."But here is an\naccount of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black\nhands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called\nHoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be\none of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to\ndeath; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy\ngreat quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by\nthe natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone\nwould compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us\nthat their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are\nraised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in\nwhich they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A\nhand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum\nin Paris.""Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures\nor hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other\nsubstances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they\ndo not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general\ncry being kept up by the party."One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor."Mamma," she\nexclaimed, "cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families."I suppose, my dear," she responded, "that there is a\ndifference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very\nfond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount\nthem on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection."But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,\nand if I can find the book, I will read it to you.""There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most\nbeautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from\nits extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at\nliberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in\norder to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a\nwife."For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every\nattention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much\ncruelty."One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than\nusual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,\nafter winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and\ndrew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave\nher a push, which threw her into the sea."This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he\ndescended in high spirits.""I should think they would have punished him," said Minnie, with great\nindignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no\nmeans always to be depended upon."Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one\nmore story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,\ncomplied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this\nchapter on Minnie\'s pet monkey."A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented\nto his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it."Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress\nused sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him\nrun up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper."On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,\nran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and\nchattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,\n\'Catch me if you can.\'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally\nleaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled\nhimself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth\nopen, his sides ready to burst with his running."Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former\nexperience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at\ncleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the\nhandle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he\nrelinquished the sport."Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and\nboots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering\nall the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole\nand all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &\nMartin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was\na nice mess for some days after."One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found\nSprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and\narranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he\nheard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as\nthough nothing had happened."Sprite was exceedingly fond of a bath.Occasionally a bowl of water was\ngiven him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his\nfinger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the\nother, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed\nhimself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped\nout and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during\nthis performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his\nmight to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over\nthem.As he was brought from a\nvery warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the\ncold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his\nbasket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning\nhe frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of\nmaking the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on\nthe tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from\nhis basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it\njust the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving\nonly his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water\nbegan to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly\nsat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have\nbeen boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and\nfirmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,\nwho, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head\nand pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon\nrecovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot\nexperience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a\nmenagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was\ngreatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty\nquestions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their\nway home, she inquired,--\n\n"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot\nconceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her\nmother, laughing."I don\'t believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"\nanswered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something\nmore about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had\nstopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered\nabout some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie\'s sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to\nget out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,\nand then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in\nthe road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had\ngone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which\nMinnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like\nher.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it\nseemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he\nfound her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave\nJohn orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering\nwhether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy\npaid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature\nmust be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many\nadmonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her\nthoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the\nanimal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like\nhead, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form\nand position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and\nhands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as\nit is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities\nof different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can\'t you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that\nthey are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the\nseverest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to\ntheir own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions\nare cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but\nhe did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable\nmatter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of\nGood Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to\ndestroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and\ngardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the\ndogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the\ngun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage\nincreases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible\nfury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking\nencyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless\nthey go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they\nwere not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,\nthey descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in\na few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,\nthey move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to\ngive notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,\nthe sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with\nthe greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into\ntheir cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her\nmother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named\nKees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"\nsaid the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The\ntraveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his\njourney, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a\nsentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his\nsense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of\nprey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they\ncame across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were\nunacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he\nthrew them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or\ndisagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these\nexcursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the\nsport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he\nshowed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance\nabout, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was\nvery fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which\npleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows\nof trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of\nwhich his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he\nwould run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it\nas fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees\' manner\nof doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong\nteeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself\ngradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,\nwhile he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,\nwhich gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come\nout."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired\nwith the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the\ndogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew\nweary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into\nservice.As soon as Kees leaped on\nhis back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the\nspot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until\nthe party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great\nhaste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were\naccustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the\nslightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their\nplaces about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them\ncame too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,\nand thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,\nwith considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,\nsmiling."He was, greatly to his master\'s sorrow, an incurable thief.He\ncould not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He\nunderstood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take\nthe cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it\nwhenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these\nmisdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his\nservants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any\nthing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,\ngenerally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the\nplace; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the\nbroken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a\nsevere beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the\ngentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as\nsoon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of\na bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had\ncarefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran\nout of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,\nbut found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some\nhours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched\nevery where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really\ndeserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a\ndistance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and\nspoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not\ncome down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take\nhim.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only\none thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le\nVaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,\npretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that\ntime could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at\na distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;\nand had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the\ninsult."*       *       *       *       *\n\n    "Nature is man\'s best teacher.She unfolds\n    Her treasures to his search, unseals his eye,\n    Illumes his mind, and purifies

the only reason they\ndesire these positions is because of the salaries attached to them.These fellows get the money and the work is done by underpaid\nsubordinates whom the world never hears of.Under Socialism, this money\nincentive will be done away with, and consequently the only men who\nwill try for these positions will be those who, being naturally fitted\nfor the work, would like to do it.For instance a man who is a born\norganizer will not refuse to undertake such work because he will not be\npaid more for it.Such a man will desire to do it and will esteem it a\nprivilege to be allowed to do it.To think out\nall the details of some undertaking, to plan and scheme and organize,\nis not work for a man like that.But for a man who\nhas sought and secured such a position, not because he liked the work,\nbut because he liked the salary--such work as this would be unpleasant\nlabour.Under Socialism the unfit man would not apply for that post but\nwould strive after some other for which he was fit and which he would\ntherefore desire and enjoy.There are some men who would rather have\ncharge of and organize and be responsible for work than do it with\ntheir hands.There are others who would rather do delicate or\ndifficult or artistic work, than plain work.A man who is a born\nartist would rather paint a frieze or a picture or carve a statue than\nhe would do plain work, or take charge of and direct the labour of\nothers.And there are another sort of men who would rather do ordinary\nplain work than take charge, or attempt higher branches for which they\nhave neither liking or natural talent.\'But there is one thing--a most important point that you seem to\nentirely lose sight of, and that is, that all these different kinds and\nclasses are equal in one respect--THEY ARE ALL EQUALLY NECESSARY.Each\nis a necessary and indispensable part of the whole; therefore everyone\nwho has done his full share of necessary work is justly entitled to a\nfull share of the results.The men who put the slates on are just as\nindispensable as the men who lay the foundations.The work of the men\nwho build the walls and make the doors is just as necessary as the work\nof the men who decorate the cornice.None of them would be of much use\nwithout the architect, and the plans of the architect would come to\nnothing, his building would be a mere castle in the air, if it were not\nfor the other workers.Each part of the work is equally necessary,\nuseful and indispensable if the building is to be perfected.Some of\nthese men work harder with their brains than with their hands and some\nwork harder with their hands than with their brains, BUT EACH ONE DOES\nHIS FULL SHARE OF THE WORK.This truth will be recognized and acted\nupon by those who build up and maintain the fabric of our Co-operative\nCommonwealth.Every man who does his full share of the useful and\nnecessary work according to his abilities shall have his full share of\nthe total result.Herein will be its great difference from the present\nsystem, under which it is possible for the cunning and selfish ones to\ntake advantage of the simplicity of others and rob them of part of the\nfruits of their labour.As for those who will be engaged in the higher\nbranches, they will be sufficiently rewarded by being privileged to do\nthe work they are fitted for and enjoy.The only men and women who are\ncapable of good and great work of any kind are those who, being\nnaturally fit for it, love the work for its own sake and not for the\nmoney it brings them.Under the present system, many men who have no\nneed of money produce great works, not for gain but for pleasure: their\nwealth enables them to follow their natural inclinations.Under the\npresent system many men and women capable of great works are prevented\nfrom giving expression to their powers by poverty and lack of\nopportunity: they live in sorrow and die heartbroken, and the community\nis the loser.These are the men and women who will be our artists,\nsculptors, architects, engineers and captains of industry.\'Under the present system there are men at the head of affairs whose\nonly object is the accumulation of money.Some of them possess great\nabilities and the system has practically compelled them to employ those\nabilities for their own selfish ends to the hurt of the community.Some of them have built up great fortunes out of the sweat and blood\nand tears of men and women and little children.For those who delight\nin such work as this, there will be no place in our Co-operative\nCommonwealth.\'\'If there won\'t be no extry pay and if anybody\nwill have all they need for just doing their part of the work, what\nencouragement will there be for anyone to worry his brains out trying\nto invent some new machine, or make some new discovery?\'\'Well,\' said Barrington, \'I think that\'s covered by the last answer,\nbut if it were found necessary--which is highly improbable--to offer\nsome material reward in addition to the respect, esteem or honour that\nwould be enjoyed by the author of an invention that was a boon to the\ncommunity, it could be arranged by allowing him to retire before the\nexpiration of his twenty-five years service.The boon he had conferred\non the community by the invention, would be considered equivalent to so\nmany years work.But a man like that would not desire to cease\nworking; that sort go on working all their lives, for love.He is one of the very few inventors who have made\nmoney out of their work; he is a rich man, but the only use his wealth\nseems to be to him is to procure himself facilities for going on with\nhis work; his life is a round of what some people would call painful\nlabour: but it is not painful labour to him; it\'s just pleasure, he\nworks for the love of it.Another way would be to absolve a man of\nthat sort from the necessity of ordinary work, so as to give him a\nchance to get on with other inventions.It would be to the interests\nof the community to encourage him in every way and to place materials\nand facilities at his disposal.\'But you must remember that even under the present system, Honour and\nPraise are held to be greater than money.How many soldiers would\nprefer money to the honour of wearing the intrinsically valueless\nVictoria Cross?\'Even now men think less of money than they do of the respect, esteem\nor honour they are able to procure with it.Many men spend the greater\npart of their lives striving to accumulate money, and when they have\nsucceeded, they proceed to spend it to obtain the respect of their\nfellow-men.Some of them spend thousands of pounds for the honour of\nbeing able to write "MP" after their names.Others\npay huge sums to gain admission to exclusive circles of society.Others give the money away in charity, or found libraries or\nuniversities.The reason they do these things is that they desire to\nbe applauded and honoured by their fellow-men.\'This desire is strongest in the most capable men--the men of genius.Therefore, under Socialism the principal incentive to great work will\nbe the same as now--Honour and Praise.But, under the present system,\nHonour and Praise can be bought with money, and it does not matter much\nhow the money was obtained.The Cross of Honour and the\nLaurel Crown will not be bought and sold for filthy lucre.They will\nbe the supreme rewards of Virtue and of Talent.\'\'What would you do with them what spends all their money in drink?\'\'I might reasonably ask you, "What\'s done with them or what you propose\nto do with them now?"There are many men and women whose lives are so\nfull of toil and sorrow and the misery caused by abject poverty, who\nare so shut out from all that makes life worth living, that the time\nthey spend in the public house is the only ray of sunshine in their\ncheerless lives.Their mental and material poverty is so great that\nthey are deprived of and incapable of understanding the intellectual\nand social pleasures of civilization...  Under Socialism there will be\nno such class as this.Everyone will be educated, and social life and\nrational pleasure will be within the reach of all.Therefore we do not\nbelieve that there will be such a class.Any individuals who abandoned\nthemselves to such a course would be avoided by their fellows; but if\nthey became very degraded, we should still remember that they were our\nbrother men and women, and we should regard them as suffering from a\ndisease inherited from their uncivilized forefathers and try to cure\nthem by placing them under some restraint: in an institute for\ninstance.\'\'Another good way to deal with \'em,\' said Harlow, \'would be to allow\nthem double pay, so as they could drink themselves to death.We could\ndo without the likes of them.\'\'Call the next case,\' said Philpot.\'This \'ere abundance that you\'re always talking about,\' said Crass, you\ncan\'t be sure that it would be possible to produce all that.You\'re\nonly assoomin\' that it could be done.\'Barrington pointed to the still visible outlines of the \'Hoblong\' that\nOwen had drawn on the wall to illustrate a previous lecture.\'Even under the present silly system of restricted production, with the\nmajority of the population engaged in useless, unproductive,\nunnecessary work, and large numbers never doing any work at all, there\nis enough produced to go all round after a fashion.More than enough,\nfor in consequence of what they call "Over-Production", the markets are\nperiodically glutted with commodities of all kinds, and then for a time\nthe factories are closed and production ceases.And yet we can all\nmanage to exist--after a fashion.This proves that if productive\nindustry were organized on the lines advocated by Socialists there\ncould be produced such a prodigious quantity of everything, that\neveryone could live in plenty and comfort.The problem of how to\nproduce sufficient for all to enjoy abundance is already solved: the\nproblem that then remains is--How to get rid of those whose greed and\ncallous indifference to the sufferings of others, prevents it being\ndone.\'and you\'ll never be able to get rid of \'em, mate,\' cried Crass,\ntriumphantly--and the man with the copper wire stitches in his boot\nsaid that it couldn\'t be done.\'Well, we mean to have a good try, anyhow,\' said Barrington.Crass and most of the others tried hard to think of something to say in\ndefence of the existing state of affairs, or against the proposals put\nforward by the lecturer; but finding nothing, they maintained a sullen\nand gloomy silence.The man with the copper wire stitches in his boot\nin particular appeared to be very much upset; perhaps he was afraid\nthat if the things advocated by the speaker ever came to pass he would\nnot have any boots at all.To assume that he had some such thought as\nthis, is the only rational way to account for his hostility, for in his\ncase no change could have been for the worse unless it reduced him to\nalmost absolute nakedness and starvation.To judge by their unwillingness to consider any proposals to alter the\npresent system, one might have supposed that they were afraid of losing\nsomething, instead of having nothing to lose--except their poverty.It was not till the chairman had made several urgent appeals for more\nquestions that Crass brightened up: a glad smile slowly spread over and\nilluminated his greasy visage: he had at last thought of a most serious\nand insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of the Co-operative\nCommonwealth.\'What,\' he demanded, in a loud voice, \'what are you goin\' to do, in\nthis \'ere Socialist Republic of yours, with them wot WON\'T WORK\'!\'As Crass flung this bombshell into the Socialist camp, the miserable,\nragged-trousered crew around him could scarce forbear a cheer; but the\nmore intelligent part of the audience only laughed.\'We don\'t believe that there will be any such people as that,\' said\nBarrington.\'There\'s plenty of \'em about now, anyway,\' sneered Crass.\'You can\'t change \'uman nature, you know,\' cried the man behind the\nmoat, and the one who had the copper wire stitches in his boot laughed\nscornfully.\'Yes, I know there are plenty such now,\' rejoined Barrington.\'It\'s\nonly what is to be expected, considering that practically all workers\nlive in poverty, and are regarded with contempt.The conditions under\nwhich most of the work is done at present are so unpleasant and\ndegrading that everyone refuses to do any unless they are compelled;\nnone of us here, for instance, would continue to work for Rushton if it\nwere not for the fact that we have either to do so or starve; and when\nwe do work we only just earn enough to keep body and soul together.Under the present system everybody who can possibly manage to do so\navoids doing any work, the only difference being that some people do\ntheir loafing better than others.The aristocracy are too lazy to\nwork, but they seem to get on all right; they have their tenants to\nwork for them.Rushton is too lazy to work, so he has arranged that we\nand Nimrod shall work instead, and he fares much better than any of us\nwho do work.Then there is another kind of loafers who go about\nbegging and occasionally starving rather than submit to such abominable\nconditions as are offered to them.These last are generally not much\nworse off than we are and they are often better off.At present,\npeople have everything to gain and but little to lose by refusing to\nwork.Under Socialism it would be just the reverse; the conditions of\nlabour would be so pleasant, the hours of obligatory work so few, and\nthe reward so great, that it is absurd to imagine that any one would be\nso foolish as to incur the contempt of his fellows and make himself a\nsocial outcast by refusing to do the small share of work demanded of\nhim by the community of which he was a member.\'As for what we should do to such individuals if there did happen to be\nsome, I can assure you that we would not treat them as you treat them\nnow.We would not dress them up in silk and satin and broadcloth and\nfine linen: we would not embellish them, as you do, with jewels of gold\nand jewels of silver and with precious stones; neither should we allow\nthem to fare sumptuously every day.Our method of dealing with them\nwould be quite different from yours.In the Co-operative Commonwealth\nthere will be no place for loafers; whether they call themselves\naristocrats or tramps, those who are too lazy to work shall have no\nshare in the things that are produced by the labour of others.If any man will not work, neither\nshall he eat.Under the present system a man who is really too lazy to\nwork may stop you in the street and tell you that he cannot get\nemployment.For all you know, he may be telling the truth, and if you\nhave any feeling and are able, you will help him.But in the Socialist\nState no one would have such an excuse, because everyone that was\nwilling would be welcome to come and help in the work of producing\nwealth and happiness for all, and afterwards he would also be welcome\nto his full share of the results.\'inquired the chairman, breaking the gloomy\nsilence that followed.\'I don\'t want anyone to think that I am blaming any of these\npresent-day loafers,\' Barrington added.\'The wealthy ones cannot be\nexpected voluntarily to come and work under existing conditions and if\nthey were to do so they would be doing more harm than good--they would\nbe doing some poor wretches out of employment.They are not to be\nblamed; the people who are to blame are the working classes themselves,\nwho demand and vote for the continuance of the present system.As for\nthe other class of loafers--those at the bottom, the tramps and people\nof that sort, if they were to become sober and industrious tomorrow,\nthey also would be doing more harm than good to the other workers; it\nwould increase the competition for work.If all the loafers in\nMugsborough could suddenly be transformed into decent house painters\nnext week, Nimrod might be able to cut down the wages another penny an\nhour.I don\'t wish to speak disrespectfully of these tramps at all.Some of them are such simply because they would rather starve than\nsubmit to the degrading conditions that we submit to, they do not see\nthe force of being bullied and chased, and driven about in order to\ngain semi-starvation and rags.They are able to get those without\nworking; and I sometimes think that they are more worthy of respect and\nare altogether a nobler type of beings than a lot of broken-spirited\nwretches like ourselves, who are always at the mercy of our masters,\nand always in dread of the sack.\'\'Do you mean to say as the time will ever come when the gentry will mix\nup on equal terms with the likes of us?\'demanded the man behind the\nmoat, scornfully.When we get Socialism there won\'t be\nany people like us.The man behind the moat did not seem very satisfied with this answer,\nand told the others that he could not see anything to laugh at.\'Now is your chance to\nget some of your own back, but don\'t hall speak at once.\'\'I should like to know who\'s goin\' to do all the dirty work?\'\'If everyone is to be allowed to choose \'is own trade, who\'d be\nfool enough to choose to be a scavenger, a sweep, a dustman or a sewer\nman?nobody wouldn\'t want to do such jobs as them and everyone would be\nafter the soft jobs.\'\'Of course,\' cried Crass, eagerly clutching at this last straw.\'The\nthing sounds all right till you comes to look into it, but it wouldn\'t\nnever work!\'\'It would be very easy to deal with any difficulty of that sort,\'\nreplied Barrington, \'if it were found that too many people were\ndesirous of pursuing certain callings, it would be known that the\nconditions attached to those kinds of work were unfairly easy, as\ncompared with other lines, so the conditions in those trades would be\nmade more severe.If we\nfound that too many persons wished to be doctors, architects, engineers\nand so forth, we would increase the severity of the examinations.This\nwould scare away all but the most gifted and enthusiastic.We should\nthus at one stroke reduce the number of applicants and secure the very\nbest men for the work--we should have better doctors, better\narchitects, better engineers than before.\'As regards those disagreeable tasks for which there was a difficulty\nin obtaining volunteers, we should adopt the opposite means.Suppose\nthat six hours was the general thing; and we found that we could not\nget any sewer men; we should reduce the hours of labour in that\ndepartment to four, or if necessary to two, in order to compensate for\nthe disagreeable nature of the work.\'Another way out of such difficulties would be to have a separate\ndivision of the Industrial army to do all such work, and to make it\nobligatory for every man to put in his first year of State service as a\nmember of this corps.Everyone\ngets the benefit of such work; there would be no injustice in requiring\neveryone to share.This would have the effect also of stimulating\ninvention; it would be to everyone\'s interest to think out means of\ndoing away with such kinds of work and there is no doubt that most of\nit will be done by machinery in some way or other.A few years ago the\nonly way to light up the streets of a town was to go round to each\nseparate gas lamp and light each jet, one at a time: now, we press a\nfew buttons and light up the town with electricity.In the future we\nshall probably be able to press a button and flush the sewers.\'\'I suppose there won\'t be no\nchurches nor chapels; we shall all have to be atheists.\'\'Everybody will be perfectly free to enjoy their own opinions and to\npractise any religion they like; but no religion or sect will be\nmaintained by the State.If any congregation or body of people wish to\nhave a building for their own exclusive use as a church or chapel or\nlecture hall it will be supplied to them by the State on the same terms\nas those upon which dwelling houses will be supplied; the State will\nconstruct the special kind of building and the congregation will have\nto pay the rent, the amount to be based on the cost of construction, in\npaper money of course.As far as the embellishment or decoration of\nsuch places is concerned, there will of course be nothing to prevent\nthe members of the congregation if they wish from doing any such work\nas that themselves in their own spare time of which they will have\nplenty.\'\'If everybody\'s got to do their share of work, where\'s the minister and\nclergymen to come from?\'\'There are at least three ways out of that difficulty.First,\nministers of religion could be drawn from the ranks of the\nVeterans--men over forty-five years old who had completed their term of\nState service.You must remember that these will not be worn out\nwrecks, as too many of the working classes are at that age now.They\nwill have had good food and clothing and good general conditions all\ntheir lives; and consequently they will be in the very prime of life.They will be younger than many of us now are at thirty; they will be\nideal men for the positions we are speaking of.All well educated in\ntheir youth, and all will have had plenty of leisure for self culture\nduring the years of their State service and they will have the\nadditional recommendation that their congregation will not be required\nto pay anything for their services.\'Another way: If a congregation wished to retain the full-time services\nof a young man whom they thought specially gifted but who had not\ncompleted his term of State service, they could secure him by paying\nthe State for his services; thus the young man would still remain in\nState employment, he would still continue to receive his pay from the\nNational Treasury, and at the age of forty-five would be entitled to\nhis pension like any other worker, and after that the congregation\nwould not have to pay the State anything.\'A third--and as it seems to me, the most respectable way--would be for\nthe individual in question to act as minister or pastor or lecturer or\nwhatever it was, to the congregation without seeking to get out of\ndoing his share of the State service.The hours of obligatory work\nwould be so short and the work so light that he would have abundance of\nleisure to prepare his orations without sponging on his\nco-religionists.\'\'Of course,\' added Barrington, \'it would not only be congregations of\nChristians who could adopt any of these methods.It is possible that a\ncongregation of agnostics, for instance, might want a separate building\nor to maintain a lecturer.\'\'What the \'ell\'s an agnostic?\'\'An agnostic,\' said the man behind the moat, \'is a bloke wot don\'t\nbelieve nothing unless \'e see it with \'is own eyes.\'\'All these details,\' continued the speaker, \'of the organization of\naffairs and the work of the Co-operative Commonwealth, are things which\ndo not concern us at all.They have merely been suggested by different\nindividuals as showing some ways in which these things could be\narranged.The exact methods to be adopted will be decided upon by the\nopinion of the majority when the work is being done.Meantime, what we\nhave to do is to insist upon the duty of the State to provide\nproductive work for the unemployed, the State feeding of\nschoolchildren, the nationalization or Socialization of Railways; Land;\nthe Trusts, and all public services that are still in the hands of\nprivate companies.If you wish to see these things done, you must\ncease from voting for Liberal and Tory sweaters, shareholders of\ncompanies, lawyers, aristocrats, and capitalists; and you must fill the\nHouse of Commons with Revolutionary Socialists.That is--with men who\nare in favour of completely changing the present system.And in the\nday that you do that, you will have solved the poverty "problem".No\nmore tramping the streets begging for a job!No more women and\nchildren killing themselves with painful labour whilst strong men stand\nidly by; but joyous work and joyous leisure for all.\'\'Is it true,\' said Easton, \'that Socialists intend to do away with the\nArmy and Navy?\'Socialists believe in International Brotherhood and\npeace.Nearly all wars are caused by profit-seeking capitalists,\nseeking new fields for commercial exploitation, and by aristocrats who\nmake it the means of glorifying themselves in the eyes of the deluded\ncommon people.You must remember that Socialism is not only a\nnational, but an international movement and when it is realized, there\nwill be no possibility of war, and we shall no longer need to maintain\nan army and navy, or to waste a lot of labour building warships or\nmanufacturing arms and ammunition.All those people who are now\nemployed will then be at liberty to assist in the great work of\nproducing the benefits of civilization; creating wealth and knowledge\nand happiness for themselves and others--Socialism means Peace on earth\nand goodwill to all mankind.But in the meantime we know that the\npeople of other nations are not yet all Socialists; we do not forget\nthat in foreign countries--just the same as in Britain--there are large\nnumbers of profit seeking capitalists, who are so destitute of\nhumanity, that if they thought it could be done successfully and with\nprofit to themselves they would not scruple to come here to murder and\nto rob.We do not forget that in foreign countries--the same as\nhere--there are plenty of so-called "Christian" bishops and priests\nalways ready to give their benediction to any such murderous projects,\nand to blasphemously pray to the Supreme Being to help his children to\nslay each other like wild beasts.And knowing and remembering all\nthis, we realize that until we have done away with capitalism,\naristocracy and anti-Christian clericalism, it is our duty to be\nprepared to defend our homes and our native land.And therefore we are\nin favour of maintaining national defensive forces in the highest\npossible state of efficiency.But that does not mean that we are in\nfavour of the present system of organizing those forces.We do not\nbelieve in conscription, and we do not believe that the nation should\ncontinue to maintain a professional standing army to be used at home\nfor the purpose of butchering men and women of the working classes in\nthe interests of a handful of capitalists, as has been done at\nFeatherstone and Belfast; or to be used abroad to murder and rob the\npeople of other nations.Socialists advocate the establishment of a\nNational Citizen Army, for defensive purposes only.We believe that\nevery able bodied man should be compelled to belong to this force and\nto undergo a course of military training, but without making him into a\nprofessional soldier, or taking him away from civil life, depriving him\nof the rights of citizenship or making him subject to military "law"\nwhich is only another name for tyranny and despotism.This Citizen\nArmy could be organized on somewhat similar lines to the present\nTerritorial Force, with certain differences.For instance, we do not\nbelieve--as our present rulers do--that wealth and aristocratic\ninfluence are the two most essential qualifications for an efficient\nofficer; we believe that all ranks should be attainable by any man, no\nmatter how poor, who is capable of passing the necessary examinations,\nand that there should be no expense attached to those positions which\nthe Government grant, or the pay, is not sufficient to cover.The\nofficers could be appointed in any one of several ways: They might be\nelected by the men they would have to command, the only qualification\nrequired being that they had passed their examinations, or they might\nbe appointed according to merit--the candidate obtaining the highest\nnumber of marks at the examinations to have the first call on any\nvacant post, and so on in order of merit.We believe in the total\nabolition of courts martial, any offence against discipline should be\npunishable by the ordinary civil law--no member of the Citizen Army\nbeing deprived of the rights of a citizen.\'\'Nobody wants to interfere with the Navy except to make its\norganization more democratic--the same as that of the Citizen Army--and\nto protect its members from tyranny by entitling them to be tried in a\ncivil court for any alleged offence.\'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were\nscientifically cultivated, it is capable of producing sufficient to\nmaintain a population of a hundred millions of people.Our present\npopulation is only about forty millions, but so long as the land\nremains in the possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be\ncultivated we shall continue to be dependent on other countries for our\nfood supply.So long as we are in that position, and so long as\nforeign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we\nshall need the Navy to protect our overseas commerce from them.If we\nhad a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine or ten millions of\nmen and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should\nbe invincible at home.No foreign power would ever be mad enough to\nattempt to land their forces on our shores.But they would now be able\nto starve us all to death in a month if it were not for the Navy.It\'s\na sensible and creditable position, isn\'t it?\'\'Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely\nstarving in their own fertile country, because a few land "Lords"\nforbid them to cultivate it.\'demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged\nsilence.\'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit\nand oppose the speaker?\'the chairman went on, finding that no one\nresponded to his appeal for questions.\'As there\'s no more questions and no one won\'t get up into the pulpit,\nit is now my painful duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.\'\'Well, Mr Chairman,\' said Harlow, \'I may say that when I came on this\nfirm I was a Liberal, but through listenin\' to several lectures by\nProfessor Owen and attendin\' the meetings on the hill at Windley and\nreading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to\nthe conclusion some time ago that it\'s a mug\'s game for us to vote for\ncapitalists whether they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories.They\'re\nall alike when you\'re workin\' for \'em; I defy any man to say what\'s the\ndifference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.There is none--there\ncan\'t be; they\'re both sweaters, and they\'ve got to be, or they\nwouldn\'t be able to compete with each other.And since that\'s what\nthey are, I say it\'s a mug\'s game for us to vote \'em into Parliament to\nrule over us and to make laws that we\'ve got to abide by whether we\nlike it or not.There\'s nothing to choose between \'em, and the proof of\nit is that it\'s never made much difference to us which party was in or\nwhich was out.It\'s quite true that in the past both of \'em have\npassed good laws, but they\'ve only done it when public opinion was so\nstrong in favour of it that they knew there was no getting out of it,\nand then it was a toss up which side did it.\'That\'s the way I\'ve been lookin\' at things lately, and I\'d almost made\nup my mind never to vote no more, or to trouble myself about politics\nat all, because although I could see there was no sense in voting for\nLiberal or Tory capitalists, at the same time I must admit I couldn\'t\nmake out how Socialism was going to help us.But the explanation of it\nwhich Professor Barrington has given us this afternoon has been a bit\nof an eye opener for me, and with your permission I should like to move\nas a resolution, "That it is the opinion of this meeting that Socialism\nis the only remedy for Unemployment and Poverty."\'The conclusion of Harlow\'s address was greeted with loud cheers from\nthe Socialists, but most of the Liberal and Tory supporters of the\npresent system maintained a sulky silence.\'I\'ll second that resolution,\' said Easton.\'And I\'ll lay a bob both ways,\' remarked Bundy.The resolution was\nthen put, and though the majority were against it, the Chairman\ndeclared it was carried unanimously.By this time the violence of the storm had in a great measure abated,\nbut as rain was still falling it was decided not to attempt to resume\nwork that day.Besides, it would have been too late, even if the\nweather had cleared up.\'P\'raps it\'s just as well it \'as rained,\' remarked one man.\'If it\n\'adn\'t some of us might \'ave got the sack tonight.As it is, there\'ll\nbe hardly enough for all of us to do tomorrer and Saturday mornin\' even\nif it is fine.\'This was true: nearly all the outside was finished, and what remained\nto be done was ready for the final coat.Inside all there was to do\nwas to colour wash the walls and to give the woodwork of the kitchen\nand scullery the last coat of paint.It was inevitable--unless the firm had some other work for them to do\nsomewhere else--that there would be a great slaughter on Saturday.\'Now,\' said Philpot, assuming what he meant to be the manner of a\nschool teacher addressing children, \'I wants you hall to make a\nspeshall heffort and get \'ere very early in the mornin\'--say about four\no\'clock--and them wot doos the most work tomorrer, will get a prize on\nSaturday.\'\'Yes,\' replied Philpot, \'and not honly will you get a prize for good\nconduck tomorrer, but if you all keep on workin\' like we\'ve bin doing\nlately till you\'re too hold and wore hout to do any more, you\'ll be\nallowed to go to a nice workhouse for the rest of your lives!and each\none of you will be given a title--"Pauper!"\'Although the majority of them had mothers or fathers or other near\nrelatives who had already succeeded to the title--they laughed!As they were going home, Crass paused at the gate, and pointing up to\nthe large gable at the end of the house, he said to Philpot:\n\n\'You\'ll want the longest ladder--the 65, for that, tomorrow.\'Chapter 46\n\nThe \'Sixty-five\'\n\n\nThe next morning after breakfast, Philpot, Sawkins, Harlow and\nBarrington went to the Yard to get the long ladder--the 65--so called\nbecause it had sixty-five rungs.It was really what is known as a\nbuilder\'s scaffold ladder, and it had been strengthened by several iron\nbolts or rods which passed through just under some of the rungs.One\nside of the ladder had an iron band or ribbon twisted and nailed round\nit spirally.It was not at all suitable for painters\' work, being\naltogether too heavy and cumbrous.However, as none of the others were\nlong enough to reach the high gable at the Refuge, they managed, with a\nstruggle, to get it down from the hooks and put it on one of the\nhandcarts and soon passed through the streets of mean and dingy houses\nin the vicinity of the yard, and began the ascent of the long hill.There had been a lot of rain during the night, and the sky was still\novercast with dark grey clouds.The cart went heavily over the muddy\nroad; Sawkins was at the helm, holding the end of the ladder and\nsteering; the others walked a little further ahead, at the sides of the\ncart.It was such hard work that by the time they were half-way up the hill\nthey were so exhausted and out of breath that they had to stop for a\nrest.\'This is a bit of all right, ain\'t it?\'remarked Harlow as he took off\nhis cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief.While they rested they kept a good look out for Rushton or Hunter, who\nwere likely to pass by at any moment.At first, no one made any reply to Harlow\'s observation, for they were\nall out of breath and Philpot\'s lean fingers trembled violently as he\nwiped the perspiration from his face.\'Yes, mate,\' he said despondently, after a while.\'It\'s one way of\ngettin\' a livin\' and there\'s plenty better ways.\'In addition to the fact that his rheumatism was exceptionally bad, he\nfelt unusually low-spirited this morning; the gloomy weather and the\nprospect of a long day of ladder work probably had something to do with\nit.\'A "living" is right,\' said Barrington bitterly.He also was exhausted\nwith the struggle up the hill and enraged by the woebegone appearance\nof poor old Philpot, who was panting and quivering from the exertion.The unaccountable depression that\npossessed Philpot deprived him of all his usual jocularity and filled\nhim with melancholy thoughts.He had travelled up and down this hill a\ngreat many times before under similar circumstances and he said to\nhimself that if he had half a quid now for every time he had pushed a\ncart up this road, he wouldn\'t need to do anyone out of a job all the\nrest of his life.The shop where he had been apprenticed used to be just down at the\nbottom; the place had been pulled down years ago, and the ground was\nnow occupied by more pretentious buildings.Not quite so far down the\nroad--on the other side--he could see the church where he used to\nattend Sunday School when he was a boy, and where he was married just\nthirty years ago.Presently--when they reached the top of the hill--he\nwould be able to look across the valley and see the spire of the other\nchurch, the one in the graveyard, where all those who were dear to him\nhad been one by one laid to rest.He felt that he would not be sorry\nwhen the time came to join them there.Possibly, in the next world--if\nthere were such a place--they might all be together once more.He was suddenly aroused from these thoughts by an exclamation from\nHarlow.Rushton was coming up the hill\nin his dog-cart with Grinder sitting by his side.They passed so\nclosely that Philpot--who was on that side of the cart--was splashed\nwith mud from the wheels of the trap.\'Them\'s some of your chaps, ain\'t they?\'\'We\'re doing a job up this way.\'\'I should \'ave thought it would pay you better to use a \'orse for sich\nwork as that,\' said Grinder.\'We do use the horses whenever it\'s necessary for very big loads, you\nknow,\' answered Rushton, and added with a laugh: \'But the donkeys are\nquite strong enough for such a job as that.\'The \'donkeys\' struggled on up the hill for about another hundred yards\nand then they were forced to halt again.\'We mustn\'t stop long, you know,\' said Harlow.\'Most likely he\'s gone\nto the job, and he\'ll wait to see how long it takes us to get there.\'Barrington felt inclined to say that in that case Rushton would have to\nwait, but he remained silent, for he remembered that although he\npersonally did not care a brass button whether he got the sack or not,\nthe others were not so fortunately circumstanced.While they were resting, another two-legged donkey passed by pushing\nanother cart--or rather, holding it back, for he was coming slowly down\nthe hill.Another Heir of all the ages--another Imperialist--a\ndegraded, brutalized wretch, clad in filthy, stinking rags, his toes\nprotruding from the rotten broken boots that were tied with bits of\nstring upon his stockingless feet.The ramshackle cart was loaded with\nempty bottles and putrid rags, heaped loosely in the cart and packed\ninto a large sack.Old coats and trousers, dresses, petticoats, and\nunder-clothing, greasy, mildewed and malodorous.As he crept along\nwith his eyes on the ground, the man gave utterance at intervals to\nuncouth, inarticulate sounds.\'That\'s another way of gettin\' a livin\',\' said Sawkins with a laugh as\nthe miserable creature slunk past.Harlow also laughed, and Barrington regarded them curiously.He\nthought it strange that they did not seem to realize that they might\nsome day become like this man themselves.\'I\'ve often wondered what they does with all them dirty old rags,\' said\nPhilpot.\'Made into paper,\' replied Harlow, briefly.\'Some of them are,\' said Barrington, \'and some are manufactured into\nshoddy cloth and made into Sunday clothes for working men.\'There\'s all sorts of different ways of gettin\' a livin\',\' remarked\nSawkins, after a pause.\'I read in a paper the other day about a bloke\nwot goes about lookin\' for open trap doors and cellar flaps in front of\nshops.As soon as he spotted one open, he used to go and fall down in\nit; and then he\'d be took to the \'orspital, and when he got better he\nused to go and threaten to bring a action against the shop-keeper and\nget damages, and most of \'em used to part up without goin\' in front of\nthe judge at all.But one day a slop was a watchin\' of \'im, and seen\n\'im chuck \'isself down one, and when they picked \'im up they found he\'d\nbroke his leg.So they took \'im to the \'orspital and when he came out\nand went round to the shop and started talkin\' about bringin\' a action\nfor damages, the slop collared \'im and they give \'im six months.\'\'Yes, I read about that,\' said Harlow, \'and there was another case of a\nchap who was run over by a motor, and they tried to make out as \'e put\n\'isself in the way on purpose; but \'e got some money out of the swell\nit belonged to; a \'undered pound I think it was.\'\'I only wish as one of their motors would run inter me,\' said Philpot,\nmaking a feeble attempt at a joke.\'I lay I\'d get some a\' me own back\nout of \'em.\'The others laughed, and Harlow was about to make some reply but at that\nmoment a cyclist appeared coming down the hill from the direction of\nthe job.It was Nimrod, so they resumed their journey once more and\npresently Hunter shot past on his machine without taking any notice of\nthem...\n\nWhen they arrived they found that Rushton had not been there at all,\nbut Nimrod had.Crass said that he had kicked up no end of a row\nbecause they had not called at the yard at six o\'clock that morning for\nthe ladder, instead of going for it after breakfast--making two\njourneys instead of one, and he had also been ratty because the big\ngable had not been started the first thing that morning.They carried the ladder into the garden and laid it on the ground along\nthe side of the house where the gable was.A brick wall about eight\nfeet high separated the grounds of \'The Refuge\' from those of the\npremises next door.Between this wall and the side wall of the house\nwas a space about six feet wide and this space formed a kind of alley\nor lane or passage along the side of the house.They laid the ladder\non the ground along this passage, the \'foot\' was placed about half-way\nthrough; just under the centre of the gable, and as it lay there, the\nother end of the ladder reached right out to the front railings.Next, it was necessary that two men should go up into the attic--the\nwindow of which was just under the point of the gable--and drop the end\nof a long rope down to the others who would tie it to the top of the\nladder.Then two men would stand on the bottom rung, so as to keep the\n\'foot\' down, and the three others would have to raise the ladder up,\nwhile the two men up in the attic hauled on the rope.They called Bundy and his mate Ned Dawson to help, and it was arranged\nthat Harlow and Crass should stand on the foot because they were the\nheaviest.Philpot, Bundy, and Barrington were to \'raise\', and Dawson\nand Sawkins were to go up to the attic and haul on the rope.None of them had thought of bringing\none from the yard.\'Why, ain\'t there one \'ere?\'\'Do you\nmean to say as you ain\'t brought one, then?\'Philpot stammered out something about having thought there was one at\nthe house already, and the others said they had not thought about it at\nall.\'Well, what the bloody hell are we to do now?\'\'I\'ll go to the yard and get one,\' suggested Barrington.\'I can do it\nin twenty minutes there and back.\'and a bloody fine row there\'d be if Hunter was to see you!\'Ere\nit\'s nearly ten o\'clock and we ain\'t made a start on this gable wot we\nought to \'ave started first thing this morning.\'\'Couldn\'t we tie two or three of those short ropes together?\'\'Those that the other two ladders was spliced with?\'As there was sure to be a row if they delayed long enough to send to\nthe yard, it was decided to act on Philpot\'s suggestion.Several of the short ropes were accordingly tied together but upon\nexamination it was found that some parts were so weak that even Crass\nhad to admit it would be dangerous to attempt to haul the heavy ladder\nup with them.\'Well, the only thing as I can see for it,\' he said, \'is that the boy\nwill \'ave to go down to the yard and get the long rope.It won\'t do\nfor anyone else to go: there\'s been one row already about the waste of\ntime because we didn\'t call at the yard for the ladder at six o\'clock.\'Bert was down in the basement of the house limewashing a cellar.Crass\ncalled him up and gave him the necessary instructions, chief of which\nwas to get back again as soon as ever he could.The boy ran off, and\nwhile they were waiting for him to come back the others went on with\ntheir several jobs.Philpot returned to the small gable he had been\npainting before breakfast, which he had not quite finished.As he\nworked a sudden and unaccountable terror took possession of him.He did\nnot want to do that other gable; he felt too ill; and he almost\nresolved that he would ask Crass if he would mind letting him do\nsomething else.There were several younger men who would not object to\ndoing it--it would be mere child\'s play to them, and Barrington had\nalready--yesterday--offered to change jobs with him.But then, when he thought of what the probable consequences would be,\nhe hesitated to take that course, and tried to persuade himself that he\nwould be able to get through with the work all right.He did not want\nCrass or Hunter to mark him as being too old for ladder work.Bert came back in about half an hour flushed and sweating with the\nweight of the rope and with the speed he had made.He delivered it to\nCrass and then returned to his cellar and went on with the limewashing,\nwhile Crass passed the word for Philpot and the others to come and\nraise the ladder.He handed the rope to Ned Dawson, who took it up to\nthe attic, accompanied by Sawkins; arrived there they lowered one end\nout of the window down to the others.\'If you ask me,\' said Ned Dawson, who was critically examining the\nstrands of the rope as he passed it out through the open window, \'If\nyou ask me, I don\'t see as this is much better than the one we made up\nby tyin\' the short pieces together.Look \'ere,\'--he indicated a part\nof the rope that was very frayed and worn--\'and \'ere\'s another place\njust as bad.\'\'Well, for Christ\'s sake don\'t say nothing about it now,\' replied\nSawkins.\'There\'s been enough talk and waste of time over this job\nalready.\'Ned made no answer and the end having by this time reached the ground,\nBundy made it fast to the ladder, about six rungs from the top.The ladder was lying on the ground, parallel to the side of the house.The task of raising it would have been much easier if they had been\nable to lay it at right angles to the house wall, but this was\nimpossible because of the premises next door and the garden wall\nbetween the two houses.On account of its having to be raised in this\nmanner the men at the top would not be able to get a straight pull on\nthe rope; they would have to stand back in the room without being able\nto see the ladder, and the rope would have to be drawn round the corner\nof the window, rasping against the edge of the stone sill and the\nbrickwork.The end of the rope having been made fast to the top of the ladder,\nCrass and Harlow stood on the foot and the other three raised the top\nfrom the ground; as Barrington was the tallest, he took the middle\nposition--underneath the ladder--grasping the rungs, Philpot being on\nhis left and Bundy on his right, each holding one side of the ladder.At a signal from Crass, Dawson and Sawkins began to haul on the rope,\nand the top of the ladder began to rise slowly into the air.Philpot was not of much use at this work, which made it all the harder\nfor the other two who were lifting, besides putting an extra strain on\nthe rope.His lack of strength, and the efforts of Barrington and\nBundy to make up for him caused the ladder to sway from side to side,\nas it would not have done if they had all been equally capable.Meanwhile, upstairs, Dawson and Sawkins--although the ladder was as yet\nonly a little more than half the way up--noticed, as they hauled and\nstrained on the rope, that it had worn a groove for itself in the\ncorner of the brickwork at the side of the window; and every now and\nthen, although they pulled with all their strength, they were not able\nto draw in any part of the rope at all; and it seemed to them as if\nthose others down below must have let go their hold altogether, or\nceased lifting.The three men found the weight so\noverpowering, that once or twice they were compelled to relax their\nefforts for a few seconds, and at those times the rope had to carry the\nwhole weight of the ladder; and the part of the rope that had to bear\nthe greatest strain was the part that chanced to be at the angle of the\nbrickwork at the side of the window.And presently it happened that\none of the frayed and worn places that Dawson had remarked about was\njust at the angle during one of those momentary pauses.On one end\nthere hung the ponderous ladder, straining the frayed rope against the\ncorner of the brickwork and the sharp edge of the stone sill, at the\nother end were Dawson and Sawkins pulling with all their strength, and\nin that instant the rope snapped like a piece of thread.One end\nremained in the hands of Sawkins and Dawson, who reeled backwards into\nthe room, and the other end flew up into the air, writhing like the\nlash of a gigantic whip.For a moment the heavy ladder swayed from\nside to side: Barrington, standing underneath, with his hands raised\nabove his head grasping one of the rungs, struggled desperately to hold\nit up.At his right stood Bundy, also with arms upraised holding the\nside; and on the left, between the ladder and the wall, was Philpot.For a brief space they strove fiercely to support the overpowering\nweight, but Philpot had no strength, and the ladder, swaying over to\nthe left, crashed down, crushing him upon the ground and against the\nwall of the house.He fell face downwards, with the ladder across his\nshoulders; the side that had the iron bands twisted round it fell\nacross the back of his neck, forcing his face against the bricks at the\nbase of the wall.He uttered no cry and was quite still, with blood\nstreaming from the cuts on his face and trickling from his ears.Barrington was also hurled to the ground with his head and arms under\nthe ladder; his head and face were cut and bleeding and he was\nunconscious; none of the others was hurt, for they had all had time to\njump clear when the ladder fell.Their shouts soon brought all the\nother men running to the spot, and the ladder was quickly lifted off\nthe two motionless figures.At first it seemed that Philpot was dead,\nbut Easton rushed off for a neighbouring doctor, who came in a few\nminutes.He knelt down and carefully examined the crushed and motionless form of\nPhilpot, while the other men stood by in terrified silence.Barrington, who fortunately was but momentarily stunned was sitting\nagainst the wall and had suffered nothing more serious than minor cuts\nand bruises.The doctor\'s examination of Philpot was a very brief one, and when he\nrose from his knees, even before he spoke they knew from his manner\nthat their worst fears were realized.Chapter 47\n\nThe Ghouls\n\n\nBarrington did not do any more work that day, but before going home he\nwent to the doctor\'s house and the latter dressed the cuts on his head\nand arms.Philpot\'s body was taken away on the ambulance to the\nmortuary.Hunter arrived at the house shortly afterwards and at once began to\nshout and bully because the painting of the gable was not yet\ncommenced.When he heard of the accident he blamed them for using the\nrope, and said they should have asked for a new one.Before he went\naway he had a long, private conversation with Crass, who told him that\nPhilpot had no relatives and that his life was insured for ten pounds\nin a society of which Crass was also a member.He knew that Philpot\nhad arranged that in the event of his death the money was to be paid to\nthe old woman with whom he lodged, who was a very close friend.The\nresult of this confidential talk was that Crass and Hunter came to the\nconclusion that it was probable that she would be very glad to be\nrelieved of the trouble of attending to the business of the funeral,\nand that Crass, as a close friend of the dead man, and a fellow member\nof the society, was the most suitable person to take charge of the\nbusiness for her.He was already slightly acquainted with the old\nlady, so he would go to see her at once and get her authority to act on\nher behalf.Of course, they would not be able to do much until after\nthe inquest, but they could get the coffin made--as Hunter knew the\nmortuary keeper there would be no difficulty about getting in for a\nminute to measure the corpse.This matter having been arranged, Hunter departed to order a new rope,\nand shortly afterwards Crass--having made sure that everyone would have\nplenty to do while he was gone--quietly slipped away to go to see\nPhilpot\'s landlady.He went off so secretly that the men did not know\nthat he had been away at all until they saw him come back just before\ntwelve o\'clock.The new rope was brought to the house about one o\'clock and this time\nthe ladder was raised without any mishap.Harlow was put on to paint\nthe gable, and he felt so nervous that he was allowed to have Sawkins\nto stand by and hold the ladder all the time.Everyone felt nervous\nthat afternoon, and they all went about their work in an unusually\ncareful manner.When Bert had finished limewashing the cellar, Crass set him to work\noutside, painting the gate of the side entrance.While the boy was\nthus occupied he was accosted by a solemn-looking man who asked him\nabout the accident.The solemn stranger was very sympathetic and\ninquired what was the name of the man who had been killed, and whether\nhe was married.Bert informed him that Philpot was a widower, and that\nhe had no children.\'Ah, well, that\'s so much the better, isn\'t it?\'said the stranger\nshaking his head mournfully.\'It\'s a dreadful thing, you know, when\nthere\'s children left unprovided for.You don\'t happen to know where\nhe lived, do you?\'\'Yes,\' said Bert, mentioning the address and beginning to wonder what\nthe solemn man wanted to know for, and why he appeared to be so sorry\nfor Philpot since it was quite evident that he had never known him.\'Thanks very much,\' said the man, pulling out his pocket-book and\nmaking a note of it.\'Good afternoon, sir,\' said Bert and he turned to resume his work.Crass came along the garden just as the mysterious stranger was\ndisappearing round the corner.said Crass, who had seen the man talking to Bert.\'I don\'t know exactly; he was asking about the accident, and whether\nJoe left any children, and where he lived.He must be a very decent\nsort of chap, I should think.\'Don\'t\nyou know who he is?\'\'No,\' replied the boy; \'but I thought p\'raps he was a reporter of some\npaper.\'\'E ain\'t no reporter: that\'s old Snatchum the undertaker.\'E\'s\nsmellin\' round after a job; but \'e\'s out of it this time, smart as \'e\nthinks \'e is.\'Barrington came back the next morning to work, and at breakfast-time\nthere was a lot of talk about the accident.They said that it was all\nvery well for Hunter to talk like that about the rope, but he had known\nfor a long time that it was nearly worn out.Newman said that only\nabout three weeks previously when they were raising a ladder at another\njob he had shown the rope to him, and Misery had replied that there was\nnothing wrong with it.Several others besides Newman claimed to have\nmentioned the matter to Hunter, and each of them said he had received\nthe same sort of reply.But when Barrington suggested that they should\nattend the inquest and give evidence to that effect, they all became\nsuddenly silent and in a conversation Barrington afterwards had with\nNewman the latter pointed out that if he were to do so, it would do no\ngood to Philpot.It would not bring him back but it would be sure to\ndo himself a lot of harm.He would never get another job at Rushton\'s\nand probably many of the other employers would\'mark him\' as well.\'So if YOU say anything about it,\' concluded Newman, \'don\'t bring my\nname into it.\'Barrington was constrained to admit that all things considered it was\nright for Newman to mind his own business.He felt that it would not\nbe fair to urge him or anyone else to do or say anything that would\ninjure themselves.Misery came to the house about eleven o\'clock and informed several of\nthe hands that as work was very slack they would get their back day at\npay time.He said that the firm had tendered for one or two jobs, so\nthey could call round about Wednesday and perhaps he might then be able\nto give some of them another start, Barrington was not one of those who\nwere\'stood off\', although he had expected to be on account of the\nspeech he had made at the Beano, and everyone said that he would have\ngot the push sure enough if it had not been for the accident.Before he went away, Nimrod instructed Owen and Crass to go to the yard\nat once: they would there find Payne the carpenter, who was making\nPhilpot\'s coffin, which would be ready for Crass to varnish by the time\nthey got there.Misery told Owen that he had left the coffin plate and the instructions\nwith Payne and added that he was not to take too much time over the\nwriting, because it was a very cheap job.When they arrived at the yard, Payne was just finishing the coffin,\nwhich was of elm.All that remained to be done to it was the pitching\nof the joints inside and Payne was in the act of lifting the pot of\nboiling pitch off the fire to do this.As it was such a cheap job, there was no time to polish it properly, so\nCrass proceeded to give it a couple of coats of spirit varnish, and\nwhile he was doing this Owen wrote the plate, which was made of very\nthin zinc lacquered over to make it look like brass:\n\n                                JOSEPH PHILPOT\n                                     Died\n                              September 1st 19--\n                                Aged 56 years.The inquest was held on the following Monday morning, and as both\nRushton and Hunter thought it possible that Barrington might attempt to\nimpute some blame to them, they had worked the oracle and had contrived\nto have several friends of their own put on the jury.There was,\nhowever, no need for their alarm, because Barrington could not say that\nhe had himself noticed, or called Hunter\'s attention to the state of\nthe rope; and he did not wish to mention the names of the others\nwithout their permission.The evidence of Crass and the other men who\nwere called was to the effect that it was a pure accident.None of them\nhad noticed that the rope was unsound.Hunter also swore that he did\nnot know of it--none of the men had ever called his attention to it; if\nthey had done so he would have procured a new one immediately.Philpot\'s landlady and Mr Rushton were also called as witnesses, and\nthe end was that the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and\nadded that they did not think any blame attached to anyone.The coroner discharged the jury, and as they and the witnesses passed\nout of the room, Hunter followed Rushton outside, with the hope of\nbeing honoured by a little conversation with him on the satisfactory\nissue of the case; but Rushton went off without taking any notice of\nhim, so Hunter returned to the room where the court had been held to\nget the coroner\'s certificate authorizing the interment of the body.This document is usually handed to the friends of the deceased or to\nthe undertaker acting for them.When Hunter got back to the room he\nfound that during his absence the coroner had given it to Philpot\'s\nlandlady, who had taken it with her.He accordingly hastened outside\nagain to ask her for it, but the woman was nowhere to be seen.Crass and the other men were also gone; they had hurried off to return\nto work, and after a moment\'s hesitation Hunter decided that it did not\nmatter much about the certificate.Crass had arranged the business\nwith the landlady and he could get the paper from her later on.Having\ncome to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject from his mind: he had\nseveral prices to work out that afternoon--estimates from some jobs the\nfirm was going to tender for.That evening, after having been home to tea, Crass and Sawkins met by\nappointment at the carpenter\'s shop to take the coffin to the mortuary,\nwhere Misery had arranged to meet them at half past eight o\'clock.Hunter\'s plan was to have the funeral take place from the mortuary,\nwhich was only about a quarter of an hour\'s walk from the yard; so\ntonight they were just going to lift in the body and get the lid\nscrewed down.It was blowing hard and raining heavily when Crass and Sawkins set out,\ncarrying the coffin--covered with a black cloth--on their shoulders.They also took a small pair of tressels for the coffin to stand on.Crass carried one of these slung over his arm and Sawkins the other.On their way they had to pass the \'Cricketers\' and the place looked so\ninviting that they decided to stop and have a drink--just to keep the\ndamp out, and as they could not very well take the coffin inside with\nthem, they stood it up against the brick wall a little way from the\nside of the door: as Crass remarked with a laugh, there was not much\ndanger of anyone pinching it.The Old Dear served them and just as\nthey finished drinking the two half-pints there was a loud crash\noutside and Crass and Sawkins rushed out and found that the coffin had\nblown down and was lying bottom upwards across the pavement, while the\nblack cloth that had been wrapped round it was out in the middle of the\nmuddy road.Having recovered this, they shook as much of the dirt off\nas they could, and having wrapped it round the coffin again they\nresumed their journey to the mortuary, where they found Hunter waiting\nfor them, engaged in earnest conversation with the keeper.The\nelectric light was switched on, and as Crass and Sawkins came in they\nsaw that the marble slab was empty.\'Snatchum came this afternoon with a hand-truck and a corfin,\'\nexplained the keeper.\'I was out at the time, and the missis thought\nit was all right so she let him have the key.\'Hunter and Crass looked blankly at each other.\'Well, this takes the biskit!\'said the latter as soon as he could\nspeak.\'I thought you said you had settled everything all right with the old\nwoman?\'\'I seen \'er on Friday, and I told \'er to\nleave it all to me to attend to, and she said she would.I told \'er\nthat Philpot said to me that if ever anything \'appened to \'im I was to\ntake charge of everything for \'er, because I was \'is best friend.And\nI told \'er we\'d do it as cheap as possible.\'\'Well, it seems to me as you\'ve bungled it somehow,\' said Nimrod,\ngloomily.\'I ought to have gone and seen \'er myself, I was afraid\nyou\'d make a mess of it,\' he added in a wailing tone.\'It\'s always the\nsame; everything that I don\'t attend to myself goes wrong.\'Crass thought that the principal piece\nof bungling in this affair was Hunter\'s failure to secure possession of\nthe Coroner\'s certificate after the inquest, but he was afraid to say\nso.Outside, the rain was still falling and drove in through the partly\nopen door, causing the atmosphere of the mortuary to be even more than\nusually cold and damp.The empty coffin had been reared against one of\nthe walls and the marble slab was still stained with blood, for the\nkeeper had not had time to clean it since the body had been removed.\'I can see \'ow it\'s been worked,\' said Crass at last.\'There\'s one of\nthe members of the club who works for Snatchum, and \'e\'s took it on\n\'isself to give the order for the funeral; but \'e\'s got no right to do\nit.\'\'Right or no right, \'e\'s done it,\' replied Misery,\'so you\'d better\ntake the box back to the shop.\'Crass and Sawkins accordingly returned to the workshop, where they were\npresently joined by Nimrod.\'I\'ve been thinking this business over as I came along,\' he said, \'and\nI don\'t see being beat like this by Snatchum; so you two can just put\nthe tressels and the box on a hand cart and we\'ll take it over to\nPhilpot\'s house.\'Nimrod walked on the pavement while the other two pushed the cart, and\nit was about half past nine, when they arrived at the street in Windley\nwhere Philpot used to live.They halted in a dark part of the street a\nfew yards away from the house and on the opposite side.\'I think the best thing we can do,\' said Misery, \'is for me and Sawkins\nto wait \'ere while you go to the \'ouse and see \'ow the land lies.You\'ve done all the business with \'er so far.It\'s no use takin\' the\nbox unless we know the corpse is there; for all we know, Snatchum may\n\'ave taken it \'ome with \'im.\'\'Yes; I think that\'ll be the best way,\' agreed Crass, after a moment\'s\nthought.Nimrod and Sawkins accordingly took shelter in the doorway of an empty\nhouse, leaving the handcart at the kerb, while Crass went across the\nstreet and knocked at Philpot\'s door.They saw it opened by an elderly\nwoman holding a lighted candle in her hand; then Crass went inside and\nthe door was shut.In about a quarter of an hour he reappeared and,\nleaving the door partly open behind him, he came out and crossed over\nto where the others were waiting.As he drew near they could see that\nhe carried a piece of paper in his hand.\'It\'s all right,\' he said in a hoarse whisper as he came up.Misery took the paper eagerly and scanned it by the light of a match\nthat Crass struck.It was the certificate right enough, and with a\nsigh of relief Hunter put it into his note-book and stowed it safely\naway in the inner pocket of his coat, while Crass explained the result\nof his errand.It appeared that the other member of the Society, accompanied by\nSnatchum, had called upon the old woman and had bluffed her into giving\nthem the order for the funeral.It was they who had put her up to\ngetting the certificate from the Coroner--they had been careful to keep\naway from the inquest themselves so as not to arouse Hunter\'s or\nCrass\'s suspicions.\'When they brought the body \'ome this afternoon,\' Crass went on,\n\'Snatchum tried to get the stifficut orf \'er, but she\'d been thinkin\'\nthings over and she was a bit frightened \'cos she knowed she\'d made\narrangements with me, and she thought she\'d better see me first; so she\ntold \'im she\'d give it to \'im on Thursday; that\'s the day as \'e was\ngoin\' to \'ave the funeral.\'\'He\'ll find he\'s a day too late,\' said Misery, with a ghastly grin.\'We\'ll get the job done on Wednesday.\'\'She didn\'t want to give it to me, at first,\' Crass concluded, \'but I\ntold \'er we\'d see \'er right if old Snatchum tried to make \'er pay for\nthe other coffin.\'\'I don\'t think he\'s likely to make much fuss about it,\' said Hunter.\'He won\'t want everybody to know he was so anxious for the job.\'Crass and Sawkins pushed the handcart over to the other side of the\nroad and then, lifting the coffin off, they carried it into the house,\nNimrod going first.The old woman was waiting for them with the candle at the end of the\npassage.\'I shall be very glad when it\'s all over,\' she said, as she led the way\nup the narrow stairs, closely followed by Hunter, who carried the\ntressels, Crass and Sawkins, bringing up the rear with the coffin.\'I\nshall be very glad when it\'s all over, for I\'m sick and tired of\nanswerin\' the door to undertakers.If there\'s been one \'ere since\nFriday there\'s been a dozen, all after the job, not to mention all the\ncards what\'s been put under the door, besides the one\'s what I\'ve had\ngive to me by different people.I had a pair of boots bein\' mended and\nthe man took the trouble to bring \'em \'ome when they was finished--a\nthing \'e\'s never done before--just for an excuse to give me an\nundertaker\'s card.\'Then the milkman brought one, and so did the baker, and the\ngreengrocer give me another when I went in there on Saturday to buy\nsome vegetables for Sunday dinner.\'Arrived at the top landing the old woman opened a door and entered a\nsmall and wretchedly furnished room.Across the lower sash of the window hung a tattered piece of lace\ncurtain.The low ceiling was cracked and discoloured.There was a rickety little wooden washstand, and along one side of the\nroom a narrow bed covered with a ragged grey quilt, on which lay a\nbundle containing the clothes that the dead man was wearing at the time\nof the accident.There was a little table in front of the window, with a small\nlooking-glass upon it, and a cane-seated chair was placed by the\nbedside and the floor was covered with a faded piece of drab-\ncarpet of no perceptible pattern, worn into holes in several places.In the middle of this dreary room, upon a pair of tressels, was the\ncoffin containing Philpot\'s body.Seen by the dim and flickering light\nof the candle, the aspect of this coffin, covered over with a white\nsheet, was terrible in its silent, pathetic solitude.Hunter placed the pair of tressels he had been carrying against the\nwall, and the other two put the empty coffin on the floor by the side\nof the bed.The old woman stood the candlestick on the mantelpiece,\nand withdrew, remarking that they would not need her assistance.The\nthree men then removed their overcoats and laid them on the end of the\nbed, and from the pocket of his Crass took out two large screwdrivers,\none of which he handed to Hunter.Sawkins held the candle while they\nunscrewed and took off the lid of the coffin they had brought with\nthem: it was not quite empty, for they had brought a bag of tools\ninside it.\'I think we shall be able to work better if we takes the other one orf\nthe trussels and puts it on the floor,\' remarked Crass.\'Yes, I think so, too,\' replied Hunter.Crass took off the sheet and threw it on the bed, revealing the other\ncoffin, which was very similar in appearance to the one they had\nbrought with them, being of elms, with the usual imitation brass\nfurniture.Hunter took hold of the head and Crass the foot and they\nlifted it off the tressels on to the floor.\'\'E\'s not very \'eavy; that\'s one good thing,\' observed Hunter.\'\'E always was a very thin chap,\' replied Crass.The screws that held down the lid had been covered over with\nlarge-headed brass nails which had to be wrenched off before they could\nget at the screws, of which there were eight altogether.It was\nevident from the appearance of the beads of these screws that they were\nold ones that had been used for some purpose before: they were rusty\nand of different sizes, some being rather larger or smaller, than they\nshould have been.They were screwed in so firmly that by the time they\nhad drawn half of them out the two men were streaming with\nperspiration.After a while Hunter took the candle from Sawkins and\nthe latter had a try at the screws.\'Anyone would think the dam\' things had been there for a \'undred\nyears,\' remarked Hunter, savagely, as he wiped the sweat from his face\nand neck with his handkerchief.Kneeling on the lid of the coffin and panting and grunting with the\nexertion, the other two continued to struggle with their task.Suddenly\nCrass uttered an obscene curse; he had broken off one side of the head\nof the screw he was trying to turn and almost at the same instant a\nsimilar misfortune happened to Sawkins.After this, Hunter again took a screwdriver himself, and when they got\nall the screws out with the exception of the two broken ones, Crass\ntook a hammer and chisel out of the bag and proceeded to cut off what\nwas left of the tops of the two that remained.But even after this was\ndone the two screws still held the lid on the coffin, and so they had\nto hammer the end of the blade of the chisel underneath and lever the\nlid up so that they could get hold of it with their fingers.It split\nup one side as they tore it off, exposing the dead man to view.Although the marks of the cuts and bruises were still visible on\nPhilpot\'s face, they were softened down by the pallor of death, and a\nplacid, peaceful expression pervaded his features.His hands were\ncrossed upon his breast, and as he lay there in the snow-white grave\nclothes, almost covered in by the white lace frill that bordered the\nsides of the coffin, he looked like one in a profound and tranquil\nsleep.They laid the broken lid on the bed, and placed the two coffins side by\nside on the floor as close together as possible.Sawkins stood at one\nside holding the candle in his left hand and ready to render with his\nright any assistance that might unexpectedly prove to be necessary.Crass, standing at the foot, took hold of the body by the ankles, while\nHunter at the other end seized it by the shoulders with his huge,\nclawlike hands, which resembled the talons of some obscene bird of\nprey, and they dragged it out and placed it in the other coffin.Whilst Hunter--hovering ghoulishly over the corpse--arranged the grave\nclothes and the frilling, Crass laid the broken cover on the top of the\nother coffin and pushed it under the bed out of the way.Then he\nselected the necessary screws and nails from the bag, and Hunter having\nby this time finished, they proceeded to screw down the lid.Then they\nlifted the coffin on to the tressels, covering it over with the sheet,\nand the appearance it then presented was so exactly similar to what\nthey had seen when they first entered the room, that it caused the same\nthought to occur to all of them: Suppose Snatchum took it into his head\nto come there and take the body out again?If he were to do so and\ntake it up to the cemetery they might be compelled to give up the\ncertificate to him and then all their trouble would be lost.After a brief consultation, they resolved that it would be safer to\ntake the corpse on the handcart to the yard and keep it in the\ncarpenter\'s shop until the funeral, which could take place from there.Crass and Sawkins accordingly lifted the coffin off the tressels,\nand--while Hunter held the light--proceeded to carry it downstairs, a\ntask of considerable difficulty owing to the narrowness of the\nstaircase and the landing.However, they got it down at last and,\nhaving put it on the handcart, covered it over with the black wrapper.It was still raining and the lamp in the cart was nearly out, so\nSawkins trimmed the wick and relit it before they started.Hunter wished them \'Good-night\' at the corner of the street, because it\nwas not necessary for him to accompany them to the yard--they would be\nable to manage all that remained to be done by themselves.He said he\nwould make the arrangements for the funeral as soon as he possibly\ncould the next morning, and he would come to the job and let them know,\nas soon as he knew himself, at what time they would have to be in\nattendance to act as bearers.He had gone a little distance on his way\nwhen he stopped and turned back to them.\'It\'s not necessary for either of you to make a song about this\nbusiness, you know,\' he said.The two men said that they quite understood that: he could depend on\ntheir keeping their mouths shut.When Hunter had gone, Crass drew out his watch.A little way down the road the lights of a public house were\ngleaming through the mist.\'We shall be just in time to get a drink before closing time if we buck\nup,\' he said.And with this object they hurried on as fast as they\ncould.When they reached the tavern they left the cart standing by the kerb,\nand went inside, where Crass ordered two pints of four-ale, which he\npermitted Sawkins to pay for.\'How are we going on about this job?\'inquired the latter after they\nhad each taken a long drink, for they were thirsty after their\nexertions.\'I reckon we ought to \'ave more than a bob for it, don\'t\nyou?It\'s not like a ordinary "lift in".\'\'Of course it ain\'t,\' replied Crass.\'We ought to \'ave about,\nsay\'--reflecting--\'say arf a dollar each at the very least.\'\'I was going to say arf a crown,\nmyself.\'Crass agreed that even half a crown would not be too much.\'\'Ow are we going\' on about chargin\' it on our time sheets?\'asked\nSawkins, after a pause.\'If we just put a "lift in", they might only\npay us a bob as usual.\'As a rule when they had taken a coffin home, they wrote on their time\nsheets, \'One lift in\', for which they were usually paid one shilling,\nunless it happened to be a very high-class funeral, when they sometimes\ngot one and sixpence.They were never paid by the hour for these jobs.\'I think the best way will be to put it like this,\' he said at length.Also takin\' corpse\nto carpenter\'s shop."Sawkins said that would be a very good way to put it, and they finished\ntheir beer just as the landlord intimated that it was closing time.The cart was standing where they left it, the black cloth saturated\nwith the rain, which dripped mournfully from its sable folds.When they reached the plot of waste ground over which they had to pass\nin order to reach the gates of the yard, they had to proceed very\ncautiously, for it was very dark, and the lantern did not give much\nlight.A number of carts and lorries were standing there, and the path\nwound through pools of water and heaps of refuse.After much\ndifficulty and jolting, they reached the gate, which Crass unlocked\nwith the key he had obtained from the office earlier in the evening.They soon opened the door of the carpenter\'s shop and, after lighting\nthe gas, they arranged the tressels and then brought in the coffin and\nplaced it upon them.Then they locked the door and placed the key in\nits usual hiding-place, but the key of the outer gate they took with\nthem and dropped into the letter-box at the office, which they had to\npass on their way home.As they turned away from the door, they were suddenly confronted by a\npoliceman who flashed his lantern in their faces and demanded to know\nwhy they had tried the lock...\n\nThe next morning was a very busy one for Hunter, who had to see several\nnew jobs commenced.Most of them would\nonly take two or three days from start to finish.Attending to this work occupied most of his morning, but all the same\nhe managed to do the necessary business connected with the funeral,\nwhich he arranged to take place at two o\'clock on Wednesday afternoon\nfrom the mortuary, where the coffin had been removed during the day,\nHunter deciding that it would not look well to have the funeral start\nfrom the workshop.Although Hunter had kept it as quiet as possible, there was a small\ncrowd, including several old workmates of Philpot\'s who happened to be\nout of work, waiting outside the mortuary to see the funeral start, and\namongst them were Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were both sober.Barrington and Owen were also there, having left work for the day in\norder to go to the funeral.They were there too in a sense as the\nrepresentatives of the other workmen, for Barrington carried a large\nwreath which had been subscribed for voluntarily by Rushton\'s men.They could not all afford to lose the time to attend the funeral,\nalthough most of them would have liked to pay that tribute of regard to\ntheir old mate, so they had done this as the next best thing.Attached\nto the wreath was a strip of white satin ribbon, upon which Owen had\npainted a suitable inscription.Promptly at two o\'clock the hearse and the mourning coach drove up with\nHunter and the four bearers--Crass, Slyme, Payne and Sawkins, all\ndressed in black with frock coats and silk hats.Although they were\nnominally attired in the same way, there was a remarkable dissimilarity\nin their appearance.Crass\'s coat was of smooth, intensely black\ncloth, having been recently dyed, and his hat was rather low in the\ncrown, being of that shape that curved outwards towards the top.Hunter\'s coat was a kind of serge with a rather rusty cast of colour\nand his hat was very tall and straight, slightly narrower at the crown\nthan at the brim.As for the others, each of them had a hat of a\ndifferent fashion and date, and their \'black\' clothes ranged from rusty\nbrown to dark blue.These differences were due to the fact that most of the garments had\nbeen purchased at different times from different second-hand clothes\nshops, and never being used except on such occasions as the present,\nthey lasted for an indefinite time.When the coffin was brought out and placed in the hearse, Hunter laid\nupon it the wreath that Barrington gave him, together with the another\nhe had brought himself, which had a similar ribbon with the words:\n\'From Rushton & Co.Seeing that Barrington and Owen were the only occupants of the\ncarriage, Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk came up to the door and asked\nif there was any objection to their coming and as neither Owen nor\nBarrington objected, they did not think it necessary to ask anyone\nelse\'s permission, so they got in.Meanwhile, Hunter had taken his position a few yards in front of the\nhearse and the bearers each his proper position, two on each side.As\nthe procession turned into the main road, they saw Snatchum standing at\nthe corner looking very gloomy.Hunter kept his eyes fixed straight\nahead and affected not to see him, but Crass could not resist the\ntemptation to indulge in a jeering smile, which so enraged Snatchum\nthat he shouted out:\n\n\'It don\'t matter!The distance to the cemetery was about three miles, so as soon as they\ngot out of the busy streets of the town, Hunter called a halt, and got\nup on the hearse beside the driver, Crass sat on the other side, and\ntwo of the other bearers stood in the space behind the driver\'s seat,\nthe fourth getting up beside the driver of the coach; and then they\nproceeded at a rapid pace.As they drew near to the cemetery they slowed down, and finally stopped\nwhen about fifty yards from the gate.Then Hunter and the bearers\nresumed their former position, and they passed through the open gate\nand up to the door of the church, where they were received by the\nclerk--a man in a rusty black cassock, who stood by while they carried\nthe coffin in and placed it on a kind of elevated table which revolved\non a pivot.They brought it in footfirst, and as soon as they had\nplaced it upon the table, the clerk swung it round so as to bring the\nfoot of the coffin towards the door ready to be carried out again.There was a special pew set apart for the undertakers, and in this\nHunter and the bearers took their seats to await the arrival of the\nclergyman.Barrington and the three others sat on the opposite side.There was no altar or pulpit in this church, but a kind of reading desk\nstood on a slightly raised platform at the other end of the aisle.After a wait of about ten minutes, the clergyman entered and, at once\nproceeding to the desk, began to recite in a rapid and wholly\nunintelligible manner the usual office.If it had not been for the\nfact that each of his hearers had a copy of the words--for there was a\nlittle book in each pew--none of them would have been able to gather\nthe sense of what the man was gabbling.Under any other circumstances,\nthe spectacle of a human being mouthing in this absurd way would have\ncompelled laughter, and so would the suggestion that this individual\nreally believed that he was addressing the Supreme Being.His attitude\nand manner were contemptuously indifferent.While he recited, intoned,\nor gabbled, the words of the office, he was reading the certificate and\nsome other paper the clerk had placed upon the desk, and when he had\nfinished reading these, his gaze wandered abstractedly round the\nchapel, resting for a long time with an expression of curiosity upon\nBill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were doing their best to follow in\ntheir books the words he was repeating.He next turned his attention to\nhis fingers, holding his hand away from him nearly at arm\'s length and\ncritically examining the nails.From time to time as this miserable mockery proceeded the clerk in the\nrusty black cassock mechanically droned out a sonorous \'Ah-men\', and\nafter the conclusion of the lesson the clergyman went out of the\nchurch, taking a short cut through the grave-stones and monuments,\nwhile the bearers again shouldered the coffin and followed the clerk to\nthe grave.When they arrived within a few yards of their destination,\nthey were rejoined by the clergyman, who was waiting for them at the\ncorner of one of the paths.He put himself at the head of the\nprocession with an open book in his hand, and as they walked slowly\nalong, he resumed his reading or repetition of the words of the service.He had on an old black cassock and a much soiled and slightly torn\nsurplice.The unseemly appearance of this dirty garment was heightened\nby the circumstance that he had not taken the trouble to adjust it\nproperly.It hung all lop-sided, showing about six inches more of the\nblack cassock underneath one side than the other.However, perhaps it\nis not right to criticize this person\'s appearance so severely, because\nthe poor fellow was paid only seven-and-six for each burial, and as\nthis was only the fourth funeral he had officiated at that day,\nprobably he could not afford to wear clean linen--at any rate, not for\nthe funerals of the lower classes.He continued his unintelligible jargon while they were lowering the\ncoffin into the grave, and those who happened to know the words of the\noffice by heart were, with some difficulty, able to understand what he\nwas saying:\n\n\'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take\nunto Himself the soul of our Dear Brother here departed, we therefore\ncommit his body to the ground; earth to earth; ashes to ashes, dust to\ndust--\'\n\nThe earth fell from the clerk\'s hand and rattled on the lid of the\ncoffin with a mournful sound, and when the clergyman had finished\nrepeating the remainder of the service, he turned and walked away in\nthe direction of the church.Hunter and the rest of the funeral party\nmade their way back towards the gate of the cemetery where the hearse\nand the carriage were waiting.On their way they saw another funeral procession coming towards them.It was a very plain-looking closed hearse with only one horse.There\nwas no undertaker in front and no bearers walked by the sides.Three men, evidently dressed in their Sunday clothes, followed behind\nthe hearse.As they reached the church door, four old men who were\ndressed in ordinary everyday clothes, came forward and opening the\nhearse took out the coffin and carried it into the church, followed by\nthe other three, who were evidently relatives of the deceased.The\nfour old men were paupers--inmates of the workhouse, who were paid\nsixpence each for acting as bearers.They were just taking out the coffin from the hearse as Hunter\'s party\nwas passing, and most of the latter paused for a moment and watched\nthem carry it into the church.The roughly made coffin was of white\ndeal, not painted or covered in any way, and devoid of any fittings or\nornament with the exception of a square piece of zinc on the lid.None\nof Rushton\'s party was near enough to recognize any of the mourners or\nto read what was written on the zinc, but if they had been they would\nhave seen, roughly painted in black letters\n\n                                     J.L.Aged 67\n\nand some of them would have recognized the three mourners who were Jack\nLinden\'s sons.As for the bearers, they were all retired working men who had come into\ntheir \'titles\'.One of them was old Latham, the venetian blind maker.Chapter 48\n\nThe Wise men of the East\n\n\nAt the end of the following week there was a terrible slaughter at\nRushton\'s.Barrington and all the casual hands were sacked, including\nNewman, Easton and Harlow, and there was so little work that it looked\nas if everyone else would have to stand off also.The summer was\npractically over, so those who were stood off had but a poor chance of\ngetting a start anywhere else, because most other firms were\ndischarging hands as well.There was only one other shop in the town that was doing anything at\nall to speak of, and that was the firm of Dauber and Botchit.This\nfirm had come very much to the front during the summer, and had\ncaptured several big jobs that Rushton & Co.had expected to get,\nbesides taking away several of the latter\'s old customers.This firm took work at almost half the price that Rushton\'s could do it\nfor, and they had a foreman whose little finger was thicker than\nNimrod\'s thigh.Some of the men who had worked for both firms during\nthe summer, said that after working for Dauber and Botchit, working for\nRushton seemed like having a holiday.\'There\'s one bloke there,\' said Newman, in conversation with Harlow and\nEaston.\'There\'s one bloke there wot puts up twenty-five rolls o\'\npaper in a day an\' trims and pastes for \'imself; and as for the\npainters, nearly everyone of \'em gets over as much work as us three put\ntogether, and if you\'re working there you\'ve got to do the same or get\nthe sack.\'However much truth or falsehood or exaggeration there may have been in\nthe stories of the sweating and driving that prevailed at Dauber and\nBotchit\'s, it was an indisputable fact that the other builders found it\nvery difficult to compete with them, and between the lot of them what\nwork there was to do was all finished or messed up in about a quarter\nof the time that it would have taken to do it properly.By the end of September there were great numbers of men out of\nemployment, and the practical persons who controlled the town were\nalready preparing to enact the usual farce of \'Dealing\' with the\ndistress that was certain to ensue.Mr Bosher talked of\nreopening the Labour Yard; the secretary of the OBS appealed for more\nmoney and cast-off clothing and boots--the funds of the Society had\nbeen depleted by the payment of his quarter\'s salary.There were\nrumours that the Soup Kitchen would be reopened at an early date for\nthe sale of \'nourishment\', and charitable persons began to talk of\nRummage Sales and soup tickets.Now and then, whenever a \'job\' \'came in\', a few of Rushton\'s men were\nable to put in a few hours\' work, but Barrington never went back.His\nmanner of life was the subject of much speculation on the part of his\nformer workmates, who were not a little puzzled by the fact that he was\nmuch better dressed than they had ever known him to be before, and that\nhe was never without money.He generally had a tanner or a bob to\nlend, and was always ready to stand a drink, to say nothing of what it\nmust have cost him for the quantities of Socialist pamphlets and\nleaflets that he gave away broadcast.He lodged over at Windley, but\nhe used to take his meals at a little coffee tavern down town, where he\nused often to invite one or two of his old mates to take dinner with\nhim.It sometimes happened that one of them would invite him home of\nan evening, to drink a cup of tea, or to see some curiosity that the\nother thought would interest him, and on these occasions--if there were\nany children in the house to which they were going--Barrington usually\nmade a point of going into a shop on their way, and buying a bag of\ncakes or fruit for them.All sorts of theories were put forward to account for his apparent\naffluence.Some said he was a toff in disguise; others that he had\nrich relations who were ashamed of him because he was a Socialist, and\nwho allowed him so much a week so long as he kept away from them and\ndid not use his real name.Some of the Liberals said that he was in\nthe pay of the Tories, who were seeking by underhand methods to split\nup the Progressive Liberal Party.Just about that time several\nburglaries took place in the town, the thieves getting clear away with\nthe plunder, and this circumstance led to a dark rumour that Barrington\nwas the culprit, and that it was these ill-gotten gains that he was\nspending so freely.About the middle of October an event happened that drew the town into a\nstate of wild excitement, and such comparatively unimportant subjects\nas unemployment and starvation were almost forgotten.Sir Graball D\'Encloseland had been promoted to yet a higher post in the\nservice of the country that he owned such a large part of; he was not\nonly to have a higher and more honourable position, but also--as was\nnothing but right--a higher salary.His pay was to be increased to\nseven thousand five hundred a year or one hundred and fifty pounds per\nweek, and in consequence of this promotion it was necessary for him to\nresign his seat and seek re-election.The ragged-trousered Tory workmen as they loitered about the streets,\ntheir stomachs empty, said to each other that it was a great honour for\nMugsborough that their Member should be promoted in this way.They\nboasted about it and assumed as much swagger in their gait as their\nbroken boots permitted.They stuck election cards bearing Sir Graball\'s photograph in their\nwindows and tied bits of blue and yellow ribbon--Sir Graball\'s\ncolours--on their underfed children.They said that an election had been sprung\non them--they had been taken a mean advantage of--they had no candidate\nready.They had no complaint to make about the salary, all they complained of\nwas the short notice.It wasn\'t fair because while they--the leading\nLiberals--had been treating the electors with the contemptuous\nindifference that is customary, Sir Graball D\'Encloseland had been most\nactive amongst his constituents for months past, cunningly preparing\nfor the contest.He had really been electioneering for the past six\nmonths!Last winter he had kicked off at quite a number of football\nmatches besides doing all sorts of things for the local teams.He had\njoined the Buffalos and the Druids, been elected President of the Skull\nand Crossbones Boys\' Society, and, although he was not himself an\nabstainer, he was so friendly to Temperance that he had on several\noccasions, taken the chair at teetotal meetings, to say nothing of the\nteas to the poor school children and things of that sort.In short, he\nhad been quite an active politician, in the Tory sense of the word, for\nmonths past and the poor Liberals had not smelt a rat until the\nelection was sprung upon them.A hurried meeting of the Liberal Three Hundred was held, and a\ndeputation sent to London to find a candidate but as there was only a\nweek before polling day they were unsuccessful in their mission.Another meeting was held, presided over by Mr Adam Sweater--Rushton and\nDidlum also being present.Profound dejection was depicted on the countenances of those assembled\nslave-drivers as they listened to the delegates\' report.The sombre\nsilence that followed was broken at length by Mr Rushton, who suddenly\nstarted up and said that he began to think they had made a mistake in\ngoing outside the constituency at all to look for a man.It was\nstrange but true that a prophet never received honour in his own land.They had been wasting the precious time running about all over the\ncountry, begging and praying for a candidate, and overlooking the fact\nthat they had in their midst a gentleman--a fellow townsman, who, he\nbelieved, would have a better chance of success than any stranger.Surely they would all agree--if they could only prevail upon him to\nstand--that Adam Sweater would be an ideal Liberal Candidate!While Mr Rushton was speaking the drooping spirits of the Three Hundred\nwere reviving, and at the name of Sweater they all began to clap their\nhands and stamp their feet.Loud shouts of enthusiastic approval burst\nforth, and cries of \'Good old Sweater\' resounded through the room.When Sweater rose to reply, the tumult died away as suddenly as it had\ncommenced.He thanked them for the honour they were conferring upon\nhim.There was no time to waste in words or idle compliments; rather\nthan allow the Enemy to have a walk-over, he would accede to their\nrequest and contest the seat.A roar of applause burst from the throats of the delighted Three\nHundred.Outside the hall in which the meeting was being held a large crowd of\npoverty-stricken Liberal working men, many of them wearing broken boots\nand other men\'s cast-off clothing, was waiting to hear the report of\nthe slave-drivers\' deputation, and as soon as Sweater had consented to\nbe nominated, Didlum rushed and opened the window overlooking the\nstreet and shouted the good news down to the crowd, which joined in the\ncheering.In response to their demands for a speech, Sweater brought\nhis obese carcass to the window and addressed a few words to them,\nreminding them of the shortness of the time at their disposal, and\nintreating them to work hard in order that the Grand old Flag might be\ncarried to victory.At such times these people forgot all about unemployment and\nstarvation, and became enthusiastic about \'Grand old Flags\'.Their\ndevotion to this flag was so great that so long as they were able to\ncarry it to victory, they did not mind being poverty stricken and\nhungry and ragged; all that mattered was to score off their hated\n\'enemies\' their fellow countrymen the Tories, and carry the grand old\nflag to victory.The fact that they had carried the flag to victory so\noften in the past without obtaining any of the spoils, did not seem to\ndamp their ardour in the least.Being philanthropists, they were\ncontent--after winning the victory--that their masters should always do\nthe looting.At the conclusion of Sweater\'s remarks the philanthropists gave three\nfrantic cheers and then someone in the crowd shouted \'What\'s the\ncolour?\'After a hasty consultation with Rushton, who being a\'master\'\ndecorator, was thought to be an authority on colours--green--grass\ngreen--was decided upon, and the information was shouted down to the\ncrowd, who cheered again.Then a rush was made to Sweater\'s Emporium\nand several yards of cheap green ribbon were bought, and divided up\ninto little pieces, which they tied into their buttonholes, and thus\nappropriately decorated, formed themselves into military order, four\ndeep, and marched through all the principal streets, up and down the\nGrand Parade, round and round the Fountain, and finally over the hill\nto Windley, singing to the tune of \'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are\nmarching\':\n\n        \'Vote, Vote, Vote for Adam Sweater!Adam Sweater is our man,\n        And we\'ll have him if we can,\n        Then we\'ll always have the biggest loaf for tea.\'The spectacle presented by these men--some of them with grey heads and\nbeards--as they marked time or tramped along singing this childish\ntwaddle, would have been amusing if it had not been disgusting.By way of variety they sang several other things, including:\n\n        \'We\'ll hang ole Closeland\n        On a sour apple tree,\'\n\nand\n\n        \'Rally, Rally, men of Windley\n        For Sweater\'s sure to win.\'As they passed the big church in Quality Street, the clock began to\nstrike.It was one of those that strike four chimes at each quarter of\nthe hour.It was now ten o\'clock so there were sixteen musical chimes:\n\n        Ding, dong!They all chanted A-dam Sweat-er\' in time with the striking clock.In\nthe same way the Tories would chant:\n\n        \'Grab--all Close--land!The town was soon deluged with mendacious literature and smothered with\nhuge posters:\n\n                      \'Vote for Adam Sweater!\'Vote for Sweater and Temperance Reform.\'\'Vote for Sweater--Free Trade and Cheap Food.\'or\n\n      \'Vote for D\'Encloseland: Tariff Reform and Plenty of Work!\'This beautiful idea--\'Plenty of Work\'--appealed strongly to the Tory\nworkmen.They seemed to regard themselves and their children as a sort\nof machines or beasts of burden, created for the purpose of working for\nthe benefit of other people.They did not think it right that they\nshould Live, and enjoy the benefits of civilization.All they desired\nfor themselves and their children was \'Plenty of Work\'.They marched about the streets singing their Marseillaise, \'Work, Boys,\nWork and be contented\', to the tune of \'Tramp, tramp, tramp the Boys\nare marching\', and at intervals as they tramped along, they gave three\ncheers for Sir Graball, Tariff Reform, and--Plenty of Work.Both sides imported gangs of hired orators who held forth every night\nat the corners of the principal streets, and on the open spaces from\nportable platforms, and from motor cars and lorries.The Tories said\nthat the Liberal Party in the House of Commons was composed principally\nof scoundrels and fools, the Liberals said that the Tory Party were\nfools and scoundrels.A host of richly dressed canvassers descended\nupon Windley in carriages and motor cars, and begged for votes from the\npoverty-stricken working men who lived there.One evening a Liberal demonstration was held at the Cross Roads on\nWindley Hill.Notwithstanding the cold weather, there was a great\ncrowd of shabbily dressed people, many of whom had not had a really\ngood meal for months.The moon was at the full,\nand the scene was further illuminated by the fitful glare of several\ntorches, stuck on the end of twelve-foot poles.The platform was a\nlarge lorry, and there were several speakers, including Adam Sweater\nhimself and a real live Liberal Peer--Lord Ammenegg.This individual\nhad made a considerable fortune in the grocery and provision line, and\nhad been elevated to the Peerage by the last Liberal Government on\naccount of his services to the Party, and in consideration of other\nconsiderations.Both Sweater and Ammenegg were to speak at two other meetings that\nnight and were not expected at Windley until about eight-thirty, so to\nkeep the ball rolling till they arrived, several other gentlemen,\nincluding Rushton--who presided--and Didlum, and one of the five pounds\na week orators, addressed the meeting.Mingled with the crowd were\nabout twenty rough-looking men--strangers to the town--who wore huge\ngreen rosettes and loudly applauded the speakers.They also\ndistributed Sweater literature and cards with lists of the different\nmeetings that were to be held during the election.These men were\nbullies hired by Sweater\'s agent.They came from the neighbourhood of\nSeven Dials in London and were paid ten shillings a day.One of their\nduties was to incite the crowd to bash anyone who disturbed the\nmeetings or tried to put awkward questions to the speakers.The hired orator was a tall, slight man with dark hair, beard and\nmoustache, he might have been called well-looking if it had not been\nfor a ugly scar upon his forehead, which gave him a rather sinister\nappearance.He was an effective speaker; the audience punctuated his\nspeech with cheers, and when he wound up with an earnest appeal to\nthem--as working men--to vote for Adam Sweater, their enthusiasm knew\nno bounds.\'I\'ve seen him somewhere before,\' remarked Barrington, who was standing\nin the crowd with Harlow, Owen and Easton.\'So have I,\' said Owen, with a puzzled expression.\'But for the life\nof me, I can\'t remember where.\'Harlow and Easton also thought they had seen the man before, but their\nspeculations were put an end to by the roar of cheering that heralded\nthe arrival of the motor car, containing Adam Sweater and his friend,\nLord Ammenegg.Unfortunately, those who had arranged the meeting had\nforgotten to provide a pair of steps, so Sweater found it a matter of\nconsiderable difficulty to mount the platform.However, while his\nfriends were hoisting and pushing him up, the meeting beguiled the time\nby singing:\n\n\n        \'Vote, vote, vote for Adam Sweater.\'After a terrible struggle they succeeded in getting him on to the cart,\nand while he was recovering his wind, Rushton made a few remarks to the\ncrowd.Sweater then advanced to the front, but in consequence of the\ncheering and singing, he was unable to make himself heard for several\nminutes.When at length he was able to proceed, ho made a very clever speech--it\nhad been specially written for him and had cost ten guineas.A large\npart of it consisted of warnings against the dangers of Socialism.Sweater had carefully rehearsed this speech and he delivered it very\neffectively.Some of those Socialists, he said, were well-meaning but\nmistaken people, who did not realize the harm that would result if\ntheir extraordinary ideas were ever put into practice.He lowered his\nvoice to a blood-curdling stage whisper as he asked:\n\n\'What is this Socialism that we hear so much about, but which so few\nunderstand?What is it, and what does it mean?\'Then, raising his voice till it rang through the air and fell upon the\nears of the assembled multitude like the clanging of a funeral bell, he\ncontinued:\n\n\'It is madness!Black Ruin for the\nrich, and consequently, of course, Blacker Ruin still for the poor!\'As Sweater paused, a thrill of horror ran through the meeting.Men\nwearing broken boots and with patches upon the seats and knees, and\nragged fringes round the bottoms of the legs of their trousers, grew\npale, and glanced apprehensively at each other.If ever Socialism did\ncome to pass, they evidently thought it very probable that they would\nhave to walk about in a sort of prehistoric highland costume, without\nany trousers or boots at all.Toil-worn women, most of them dressed in other women\'s shabby cast-off\nclothing--weary, tired-looking mothers who fed their children for the\nmost part on adulterated tea, tinned skimmed milk and bread and\nmargarine, grew furious as they thought of the wicked Socialists who\nwere trying to bring Ruin upon them.It never occurred to any of these poor people that they were in a\ncondition of Ruin, Black Ruin, already.But if Sweater had suddenly\nfound himself reduced to the same social condition as the majority of\nthose he addressed, there is not much doubt that he would have thought\nthat he was in a condition of Black Ruin.The awful silence that had fallen on the panic-stricken crowd, was\npresently broken by a ragged-trousered Philanthropist, who shouted out:\n\n\'We knows wot they are, sir.Most of \'em is chaps wot\'s got tired of\nworkin\' for their livin\', so they wants us to keep \'em.\'Encouraged by numerous expressions of approval from the other\nPhilanthropists, the man continued:\n\n\'But we ain\'t such fools as they thinks, and so they\'ll find out next\nMonday.Most of \'em wants \'angin\', and I wouldn\'t mind lendin\' a \'and\nwith the rope myself.\'Applause and laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Sweater\nresumed his address, when another man--evidently a Socialist--for he\nwas accompanied by three or four others who like himself wore red\nties--interrupted and said that he would like to ask him a question.No notice was taken of this request either by Mr Sweater or the\nchairman, but a few angry cries of \'Order!\'Sweater continued, but the man again interrupted and the cries of the\ncrowd became more threatening.Rushton started up and said that he\ncould not allow the speaker to be interrupted, but if the gentleman\nwould wait till the end of the meeting, he would have an opportunity of\nasking his question then.The man said he would wait as desired; Sweater resumed his oration, and\npresently the interrupter and his friends found themselves surrounded\nby the gang of hired bullies who wore the big rosettes and who glared\nmenacingly at them.Sweater concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to deal a\n\'Slashing Bow at the Enemy\' next Monday, and then amid a storm of\napplause, Lord Ammenegg stepped to the front.He said that he did not\nintend to inflict a long speech upon them that evening, and as it was\nnomination day tomorrow he would not be able to have the honour of\naddressing them again during the election; but even if he had wished to\nmake a long speech, it would be very difficult after the brilliant and\neloquent address they had just listened to from Mr Sweater, for it\nseemed to him (Ammenegg) that Adam Sweater had left nothing for anyone\nelse to say.But he would like to tell them of a Thought that had\noccurred to him that evening.They read in the Bible that the Wise Men\ncame from the East.Windley, as they all knew, was the East end of the\ntown.They were the men of the East, and he was sure that next Monday\nthey would prove that they were the Wise Men of the East, by voting for\nAdam Sweater and putting him at the top of the poll with a \'Thumping\nMajority\'.The Wise Men of the East greeted Ammenegg\'s remarks with prolonged,\nimbecile cheers, and amid the tumult his Lordship and Sweater got into\nthe motor car and cleared off without giving the man with the red tie\nor anyone else who desired to ask questions any opportunity of doing\nso.Rushton and the other leaders got into another motor car, and\nfollowed the first to take part in another meeting down-town, which was\nto be addressed by the great Sir Featherstone Blood.The crowd now resolved itself into military order, headed by the men\nwith torches and a large white banner on which was written in huge\nblack letters, \'Our man is Adam Sweater\'.They marched down the hill singing, and when they reached the Fountain\non the Grand Parade they saw another crowd holding a meeting there.These were Tories and they became so infuriated at the sound of the\nLiberal songs and by the sight of the banner, that they abandoned their\nmeeting and charged the processionists.Both\nsides fought like savages, but as the Liberals were outnumbered by\nabout three to one, they were driven off the field with great\nslaughter; most of the torch poles were taken from them, and the banner\nwas torn to ribbons.Then the Tories went back to the Fountain\ncarrying the captured torches, and singing to the tune of \'Has anyone\nseen a German Band?\'\'Has anyone seen a Lib\'ral Flag,\n        Lib\'ral Flag, Lib\'ral Flag?\'While the Tories resumed their meeting at the Fountain, the Liberals\nrallied in one of the back streets.Messengers were sent in various\ndirections for reinforcements, and about half an hour afterwards they\nemerged from their retreat and swooped down upon the Tory meeting.They\noverturned the platform, recaptured their torches, tore the enemy\'s\nbanner to tatters and drove them from their position.Then the\nLiberals in their turn paraded the streets singing \'Has anyone seen a\nTory Flag?\'and proceeded to the hall where Sir Featherstone was\nspeaking, arriving as the audience left.The crowd that came pouring out of the hall was worked up to a frenzy\nof enthusiasm, for the speech they had just listened to had been a sort\nof manifesto to the country.In response to the cheering of the processionists--who, of course, had\nnot heard the speech, but were cheering from force of habit--Sir\nFeatherstone Blood stood up in the carriage and addressed the crowd,\nbriefly outlining the great measures of Social Reform that his party\nproposed to enact to improve the condition of the working classes; and\nas they listened, the Wise Men grew delirious with enthusiasm.He\nreferred to Land Taxes and Death Duties which would provide money to\nbuild battleships to protect the property of the rich, and provide Work\nfor the poor.Another tax was to provide a nice, smooth road for the\nrich to ride upon in motor cars--and to provide Work for the poor.Another tax would be used for Development, which would also make Work\nfor the poor.A great point was made of the fact that the\nrich were actually to be made to pay something towards the cost of\ntheir road themselves!But nothing was said about how they would get\nthe money to do it.No reference was made to how the workers would be\nsweated and driven and starved to earn Dividends and Rent and Interest\nand Profits to put into the pockets of the rich before the latter would\nbe able to pay for anything at all.These are the things, Gentlemen, that we propose to do for you, and, at\nthe rate of progress which we propose to adopt, I say without fear or\ncontradiction, that within the next Five Hundred years we shall so\nreform social conditions in this country, that the working classes will\nbe able to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization.\'The only question before you is: Are you willing to wait for Five\nHundred Years?\'\'Yes, sir,\' shouted the Wise Men with enthusiasm at the glorious\nprospect.\'Yes, Sir: we\'ll wait a thousand years if you like, Sir!\'\'I\'ve been waiting all my life,\' said one poor old veteran, who had\nassisted to \'carry the "Old Flag" to victory\' times out of number in\nthe past and who for his share of the spoils of those victories was now\nin a condition of abject, miserable poverty, with the portals of the\nworkhouse yawning open to receive him; \'I\'ve waited all my life, hoping\nand trusting for better conditions so a few more years won\'t make much\ndifference to me.\'\'Don\'t you trouble to \'urry yourself, Sir,\' shouted another Solomon in\nthe crowd.You know\nbetter than the likes of us \'ow long it ought to take.\'In conclusion, the great man warned them against being led away by the\nSocialists, those foolish, unreasonable, impractical people who wanted\nto see an immediate improvement in their condition; and he reminded\nthem that Rome was not built in a day.It did not appear to occur to any of\nthem that the rate at which the ancient Roman conducted their building\noperations had nothing whatever to do with the case.Sir Featherstone Blood sat down amid a wild storm of cheering, and then\nthe procession reformed, and, reinforced by the audience from the hall,\nthey proceeded to march about the dreary streets, singing, to the tune\nof the \'Men of Harlech\':\n\n        \'Vote for Sweater, Vote for Sweater!Vote for Sweater, VOTE FOR SWEATER!\'He\'s the Man, who has a plan,\n        To liberate and reinstate the workers!\'Men of Mugs\'bro\', show your mettle,\n        Let them see that you\'re in fettle!Once for all this question settle\n        Sweater shall Prevail!\'The carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and\nDidlum was in the middle of the procession.The banner and the torches\nwere at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four\nmen who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in\nfrying pans.As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily\ndressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were\nalmost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his\ncap waved it in the air and shrieked out: \'Three Cheers for Sir\nFeatherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!\'The Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the\nhorses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage\ninstead.\'\'Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if \'e is made Prime\nMinister?\'asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing\nup behind the carriage.\'Five thousand a year,\' replied the other, who by some strange chance\nhappened to know.\'That comes to a \'underd pounds a week.\'\'Little enough, too, for a man like \'im,\' said Harlow.\'You\'re right, mate,\' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.\'Last time \'e \'eld office \'e was only in for five years, so \'e only\nmade twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.Of course \'e got a pension\nas well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,\nwhat\'s that--for a man like \'im?\'\'Nothing,\' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who\nwas also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be\nat least double that amount.However, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone\nwould not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his\npension; he would get it directly he came out of office.The following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way\nof thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a\nlot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the\ncrowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing\nthis they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters\nof the capitalist system.In their attempts to persuade others to\nrefrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed\neven by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as\nthere was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for\nthe better of the two.This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom\nthey met.Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore\nD\'Encloseland\'s colours.One man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be\ncompelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be\ndisenfranchised!Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.The other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it\nwould ruin the country.Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of\nSocialism.The man said he was not, and when further questioned he\nsaid that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin\nupon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so.When\nBarrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a\nSocialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be\ncompelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.The hired orators\ncontinued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of\nliterature flooded the town.The walls were covered with huge posters:\n\'Another Liberal Lie.\'Unconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for\nSocialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the\nhypocrisy of the other.If the people had only had the sense, they\nmight have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders\nwas merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately\nmost of the people had not the sense to perceive this.They were\nblinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with\nmaniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but \'carrying their flags to\nvictory\'.At considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other\nSocialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the\nLiberal and Tory speakers.They asked the Tories to explain the\nprevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like\nGermany and America, and at Sweater\'s meetings they requested to be\ninformed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.From both\nparties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of\nviolence and requests \'not to disturb the meeting\'.These Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.Every now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some\nunwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and\nsoon a crowd would gather round and listen.Sometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an\nabsolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to\ndeny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour\nmarket; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of\nunemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed\nwaiting to take other men\'s jobs away from them destroys the\nindependence of those who are in employment and keeps them in\nsubjection to their masters.They found it impossible to deny that\nthis machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make\nfortunes for a few.In short, they were unable to disprove that the\nmonopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is\nthe cause of the poverty of the majority.But when these arguments\nthat they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was\npointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and\nManagement of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,\nhaving no alternative plan to suggest.At other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome\ndisputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which\nsplit itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original\nsubject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,\nfor most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of\npursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.A discussion would\nbe started about something or other; presently an unimportant side\nissue would crop up, then the original subject would be left\nunfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.In a\nlittle while another side issue would arise, and then the first side\nissue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about\nthe second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether\nforgotten.They did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out\nthe best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their\nonly object seemed to be to score off their opponents.Usually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,\nwith his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and\nmisery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the\nhopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow\nworkmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the\ncauses that produced their sufferings.It was not that those causes\nwere so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive\nthem; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child\ncould easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but\nit seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so\nconvinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare\nto rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign\nthe management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those\nwho battened upon and robbed them.They did not know the causes of the\npoverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel\ngrip, and--they did not want to know!And if one explained those\ncauses to them in such language and in such a manner that they were\nalmost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the\nobvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained\nsilent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer\nand disprove.They remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the\nreason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the\nevidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their\nmasters and exploiters.And when it came to making this choice they\ndeemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own\njudgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into\nthem the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their\nconviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded\nexpression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of\nthemselves and each other--\'The Likes of Us!\'They did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to\nknow, they did not want to hear.All they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to\nworship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and\nrobbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools\nor scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the\ndesolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure\nfor their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it\nprofitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep\nplaced themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being\nmobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets\nwithout any serious trouble.Towards the latter part of one evening\nBarrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly\nafterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o\'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening\nto the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the\nhill--the man with the scar on his forehead.The crowd was applauding\nhim loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen\nthis man before.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no\nreference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington\nexamined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they\nhad met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of\nthe Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town\nthat Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man\nwho had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a\nstone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man\nwho had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man\nwore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the\nshade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,\nand Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak\nto him.They were in the\nvicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,\nwhere several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,\nand a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the\npavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by\ntwo or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they\ncarried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance\nof getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid\nspeakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile\ncrowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and\nvice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,\nsinging, \'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland\' or \'good ole\nSweater\', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of\nhooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,\ncursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the\npavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against\nwalls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic\nimbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of\nthe church chimes,\n\n        \'Good--ole--Sweat--er\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er.\'Other groups--to the same tune--sang \'Good--ole--Close--land\'; and\nevery now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat\neach other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about\nthe respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D\'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed\nin every line the contempt of those who published them for the\nintelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was\none Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in\nfront of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his\nmouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute\nwho represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the\nletterpress on the poster said it was a man!This is the ideal of\nmanhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,\nbut privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such\n\'men\' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.They were more\ncunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more\ncalculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.When Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man\nwith the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.Barrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and\nafter glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any\nremark.\'I hope you\'ll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a\nSocialist?\'Even in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and\nthen become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed\nwith ghastly distinctiveness.\'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever\ncease to be one.\'\'You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work\nyou are at present engaged in.You must have changed your opinions\nsince you were here last.\'\'No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.It is\nimpossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish\nit.A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and\ndegradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows\nthat that remedy--the state of society that will be called\nSocialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the\nextermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not\nfollow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of\nknowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order\nto help to bring that state of society into being.When I first\nacquired that knowledge,\' he continued, bitterly, \'I was eager to tell\nthe good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health\nin order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it\nwillingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,\nand that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.\'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there\'s no\nneed to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself\nin order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing\nevil.If you don\'t want to help to bring about a better state of\naffairs, there\'s no reason why you should help to perpetuate the\npresent system.\'\'Oh yes, there is, and a very good\nreason too.\'\'I don\'t think you could show me a reason,\' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless\nlaugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again\nfull of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I\npossess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach\nthem how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they\nmight save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did\nnot want them to give me money.And they paid me\nwith hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to\nrob them, they have treated me with respect.\'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money\nto his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of\nthem howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,\nothers standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of\nintelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words\nconvey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes\ngleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for\nan opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal\nnatures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of\nblood!Can\'t you see that these people, whom you are trying to make\nunderstand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine\nof universal brotherhood and love are for the most\npart--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they\nfeel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of\ncourse--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to\nWork.\'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are\nthe people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just\nas well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason\nwith them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get\nbetter conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are\nthe enemy you will have to fight against.They\'ll hate you, and, if\nthey get the chance, they\'ll tear you to pieces.But if you\'re a\nsensible man you\'ll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess\nfor your own benefit.Don\'t think about Socialism or any other "ism".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn\'t matter how you get\nit, but--get it.If you can\'t get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but\nget it!and then they\'ll have some respect for you.\'\'There\'s something in what you say,\' replied Barrington, after a long\npause, \'but it\'s not all.Circumstances make us what we are; and\nanyhow, the children are worth fighting for.\'\'You may think so now,\' said the other, \'but you\'ll come to see it my\nway some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to\nlet them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don\'t\nsee why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to\nreason,\' he continued after a pause, \'I can put you on to something\nthat will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.\'\'Look here: you\'re a Socialist; well, I\'m a Socialist too: that is, I\nhave sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable\nand right; it will come when the majority of the people are\nsufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will\nnever be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these\npeople are simply not intellectually capable of abstract\nreasoning--they can\'t grasp theories.You know what the late Lord\nSalisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free\nlibraries: He said: "They don\'t want libraries: give them a circus."You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they\nhave to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies\nof grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is\nwhy it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and\nthat\'s where you make a mistake--you\'re simply wasting your time.\'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means\nof object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing\nnumbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson\nwhich demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in\ntime compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt\nthat, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from\ntheoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,\nand then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.Do you think it will make any real\ndifference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?\'\'Well, you can\'t keep them both out--you have no candidate of your\nown--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of\nthem to get in?There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to\ndo; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to\nmake up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word\nfrom your party would decide them.Since you have no candidate of your\nown you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing\nyourself a bit of good.If you like to come along with me now, I\'ll\nintroduce you to Sweater\'s agent--no one need know anything about it.\'He slipped his arm through Barrington\'s, but the latter released\nhimself.\'Please yourself,\' said the other with an affectation of indifference.You may choose to be a Jesus Christ\nif you like, but for my part I\'m finished.For the future I intend to\nlook after myself.As for these people--they vote for what they want;\nthey get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!They are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my\nway they should be chastised with scorpions!For them, the present\nsystem means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature\ndeath.Well, let them have what\nthey vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!\'The man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments\nBarrington did not reply.\'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,\' he said\nslowly at last, \'but it seems to me that you do not make enough\nallowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have\nbeen taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own\nclass with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who\npossess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they\nare really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their\nso-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different\nfrom them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ\nfrom each other, and inferior to them only because they have been\ndeprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I\ndo that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.\'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in\ntheir cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,\nhave succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is\ntheir duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves\nlowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be\ndirected against the deceivers, not against the dupes.\'\'Well, go and try to undeceive them,\' he said, as he returned to the\nplatform in response to a call from his associates.\'Go and try to\nteach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness\nfor the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to\nthem that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not\nbecause of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed\nof their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that\ninheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful\nthey\'ll be to you.\'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a\ndispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have\ntaken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,\nbut the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and\nafter a while he discontinued it.Like\none awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a\ndifferent light.For the first time he properly appreciated the\noffensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,\nwithout even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely\nrefused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the\nprinting, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them\naway.Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or\ncontemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.His attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or\nforty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.The sound\nof many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he\nstood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able\nto look into the centre, where he saw Owen.The light of the street\nlamp fell full upon the latter\'s pale face, as he stood silent in the\nmidst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,\nand whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they\nshouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the\nLiberal and Tory papers.Socialists wished to do away with religion and morality!All the money that the working classes had\nsaved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be\nRobbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who\nwere too lazy to work.The King and all the Royal Family were to be\nDone Away with!Owen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every\nmoment more threatening.It was evident that several of them found it\ndifficult to refrain from attacking him.It was a splendid opportunity\nof doing a little fighting without running any risks.This fellow was\nall by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.Those in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,\nwho urged them to \'Go for him\' and at last--almost at the instant of\nBarrington\'s arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any\nlonger, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.The sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone\nwho could get within striking distance joined furiously in the\nonslaught, reaching eagerly over each other\'s shoulders, showering\nblows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach\nhis side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their\nboots upon him.Barrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his\nway through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and\nelbows.He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the\nman who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he\nfelled him to the ground with a single blow.The remainder shrank\nback, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running\nup.Some of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did\nnot know what the row was about they attacked each other.The Liberals\nwent for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few\nseconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original\ncrowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen\ngot out of the crowd without further molestation.Monday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in\nconsequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the\nstreets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.The wealthy persons who\nowned these carriages...\n\nThe result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the\nTown Hall, at eleven o\'clock that night, and long before that hour a\nvast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.About ten o\'clock it\nbegan to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers\nas the time went by.At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a\nterrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero\nhad conquered.Eleven o\'clock came and an intense silence fell upon\nthe crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign\nwas to be exhibited.To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed\nby these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some\ngreat benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of\ncourse that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that\nthe result of this election would make no more real difference to them\nthan all the other elections that had gone before.There were ten thousand\nvoters on the register.At a quarter past eleven the sign was\nilluminated, but the figures were not yet shown.Next, the names of\nthe two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still\nmissing, but D\'Encloseland\'s name was on top, and a hoarse roar of\ntriumph came from the throats of his admirers.Then the two slides\nwith the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank.After\na time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,\nand presently some of them began to groan and hoot.After a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with\nSweater\'s name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:\n\n        Sweater.4,221\n        D\'Encloseland.4,200\n\nIt was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it\nwas too good to be true.It is impossible to say what was the reason\nof the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but\nwhatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to\nreap--there was the fact.They were all cheering and dancing and\nshaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with\ninexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.It was\naltogether extraordinary and unaccountable.A few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and\nmade a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the\ncheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as \'Slashing Blow\',\n\'Sweep the Country\', \'Grand Old Liberal Flag\', and so on.Next\nD\'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,\nwhom he referred to as \'My friend\'.When the two \'friends\' disappeared from the window, the part of the\nLiberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their\nenemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town\nHall, where Sweater\'s carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had\nplaced his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid\nfrantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it\nthrough the mud and the pouring rain all the way to \'The Cave\'--most of\nthem were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again\naddressed a few words to them from the porch.Afterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from\nhead to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause\nof progress!Chapter 49\n\nThe Undesired\n\n\nThat evening about seven o\'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing\nthe last of the election, Ruth\'s child was born.After the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours\nthat elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and\nCharley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because\nMrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed\ntones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied\nthe kitchen.Easton did not return until after midnight, and all through the\nintervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying\nin bed with the child by her side.Her wide-open eyes appeared\nunnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like\npaleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she\nwaited and listened for the sound of Easton\'s footsteps.Outside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:\na far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from\nthe direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were\nbeing enacted.Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a\nfurious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and\nsinging.Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.Those\nwho can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of\na hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by\nhis pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of\nescape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way\nin which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness\nof the dimly lighted room.And ever and again, when her wandering\nglance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her\nbrows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly\nreached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly\nmurmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of\nendearment and pity.And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance\npasserby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and\nfearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading\nthrough all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,\nsitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded\nlamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some\nimpending danger.It was after twelve o\'clock when Easton came home.Ruth recognized his\nfootsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop\nbeating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had\npassed through.It had been Mary\'s intention to withdraw before he came into the room,\nbut the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her\nso earnestly not to go away, that she remained.It was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how\nRuth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after\nthis, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that\nit was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the\nchild lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.The next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next\nfortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.There were intervals when\nalthough weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the\ntime she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.Mrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just\nthen had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give\npart of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and\nover again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.And so\nthe two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.Sometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and\nterrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the\nworld, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence.Once\nshe seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the\nbed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.And so it\noften became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that\nshe could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her\nfirst thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind\nsome faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,\nfor when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her\ndistress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with\ntears to give it back to her.And then she would kiss and fondle it\nwith all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.Easton did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very\nill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.Rushton\'s had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were\nin a similar plight.Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,\nand Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always\ntold they were full up.The sweating methods of this firm continued to\nform a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who\nrailed at and cursed them horribly.It had leaked out that they were\npaying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their\nemployment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,\nif possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.The men\nwere treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where\ndriving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy\npolluted the air from morning till night.The resentment of those who\nwere out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,\nbut also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their\nemployment.These poor wretches were denounced as\'scabs\' and\n\'wastrels\' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber\nand Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in\nobtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest\nand bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off\neagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting\none.Frequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton\'s\noffice, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and\nwriting out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible\npoint in the hope of underbidding their rivals.Now and then they were\nsuccessful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always\nappeared equally miserable.If they got the \'job\' it often showed such\na small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and\nsuggest mismanagement.If their estimates were too high and they lost\nthe work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber\nand Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.As the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked\naimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his\nbicycle, looking worried and harassed.He was such a picture of\nmisery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never\nbeen the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of\nthem declared, that they wouldn\'t mind betting that ole Misery would\nfinish up by going off his bloody rocker.At intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and\none or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton\'s, but they\nseldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when\nthere was anything to do.Chapter 50\n\nSundered\n\n\nDuring the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.Although the\ndelirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very\nstrange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long\nintervals.Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back\nto her own home till the evening.Frankie used to call for her as he\ncame out of school and then they used to go home together, taking\nlittle Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able\nto look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.On Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs\nOwen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after\nsaying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked\nwhether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to\ntake charge of Freddie for Easton.Owen\'s wife gave the required\npromise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as\naltogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,\nbut she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as\nwell.Nora went away about five o\'clock, leaving Ruth\'s bedroom door open so\nthat Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.About a\nquarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary\nLinden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast\nasleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.The weather had\nbeen very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a\ndark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.Charley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the\nwheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another\nboy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.Easton was not yet home; Rushton & Co.had a few jobs to do and he had\nbeen at work since the previous Thursday.The place where he was\nworking was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past\nsix when he came home.They heard him at the gate and at her mother\'s\ndirection Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask\nhim to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.Mary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was\na bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.He lit the lamp and\nafter removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and\nwhile he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs.There was\nno lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter\ndarkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the\nprevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the\ndifferent objects in the room distinctly.The intense silence that\nreigned struck him with a sudden terror.He crossed swiftly over to\nthe bed and a moment\'s examination sufficed to tell him that it was\nempty.He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried\nsearch only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.Mrs Linden now remembered what Owen\'s wife had told her of the strange\nrequest that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his\nfears became intensified a thousandfold.He was unable to form any\nopinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he\nrushed out to seek for her.Almost unconsciously he directed his steps\nto Owen\'s house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where\nthey thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any\ntrace of her.Her father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of\nthe first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely\nshe would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her\nstepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.They sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to\nEaston\'s house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of\nher, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the\ndreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose\nbusiness compelled them to be out.About eleven o\'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for\nOwen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman\'s figure in\nthe shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.It was an unoccupied\nhouse with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it\ncontained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be\ncertain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that\nthere was someone there.At last she summoned sufficient courage to\ncross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became\nevident that she had not been mistaken.There was a woman standing\nthere--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the\npillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.Her attitude\nwas one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived\nthat she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost\nfainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until\nrepeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not\nlet him see her if he came.And when at length she yielded and went\ninto the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket\nuntil--crouching on the floor beside Nora\'s chair with her face hidden\nin the latter\'s lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the\nsame things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often\nbefore during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account\nof her wanderings that night.She cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed\nas she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with\nself-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over\nand over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could\nnot refrain from weeping also as she listened.It appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton\'s presence\nseemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and\nalways haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed\nthe dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child\'s.When\nshe arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night\nbut she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place\nat the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she\nhad gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had\nrecently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get\ninto the park by that way.And then, when she found it impossible to\nput her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the\nfolly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.But although\nshe had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home\nagain; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or\nperhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her\nto have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay\nsomeone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.If she\nonly had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something\nto do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could\nnot go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets\nall night than go there again.It was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had\nbeen Frankie\'s playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a\nsecond-hand shop close by.Easton did not learn the real reason of her\nflight until three days afterwards.At first he attributed it to a\nrecurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the\nbirth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen\'s place\nin Nora\'s care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned\nhome from work, he found a letter in Ruth\'s handwriting which told him\nall there was to tell.When he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the\nperusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he\nfound upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous\nmorning.Slyme\'s landlady said he had told her that he had been\noffered several months\' work in London, which he had accepted.The\ntruth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth\'s flight--nearly everyone knew\nabout it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,\nguessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.Easton made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen\'s and took\nFreddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child\nwhilst he was at work.His manner was that of a deeply injured\nman--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had\nhappened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.As for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from\nher, although she cried about it in secret.She got some work a few\ndays afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large\nboarding-houses on the Grand Parade.Nora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an\narrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good\nas having a baby of their very own.For the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade\nhimself that he did not very much regret what had happened.Mrs Linden\nlooked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really\nbe better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.At first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of\nRuth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day\nwhen the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself\nrather offensively.He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame\nthan she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton\nfound it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man\'s words\nsuggested.Now and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at\nthe same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the\nstreet.They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the\nscarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor\nthat succeeded it.He never went to Owen\'s place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor\ndid she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she\nfrequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she\noften called to see Mrs Owen.As time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its\nfirst bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little\njustification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within\nhim an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget\nall that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more\nhopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.Although perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely\nfrom selfish motives.The money he earned seemed to melt away almost\nas soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not\nnearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been\nformerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the\nwintry days dragged slowly by.Sometimes--when he had the money--he\nsought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters\nof the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same\npleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had\nfound it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as\nto almost make him forget Ruth\'s existence.One evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were\nwalking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first\ntime to their former conversation.He spoke with a superior air: his\nmanner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great\ngenerosity.He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he\nsaid, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the\nchild.Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar\ninstitution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he\nknew that her stepmother would not take it.\'If you can persuade her to return to you, we\'ll take the child,\' said\nOwen.\'Do you think your wife would be willing?\'We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would\nlike to have the child.\'\'But would you be able to afford it?\'\'Of course,\' said Easton, \'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay\nsomething for its keep.\'After a long pause Easton continued: \'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to\nsuggest it to Ruth?\'\'If you like I\'ll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.\'\'What I meant,\' said Easton hesitatingly, \'was that your wife might\njust suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best\nway, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.\'\'No,\' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the\nother\'s manner, \'as things stand now, if it were not for the other\nchild, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you.You\nseem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being\n"willing" to have her back, but she\'s better off now than she was with\nyou.I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go\nback to you.As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you\nill-treated her.\'I never raised my hand to her--at least only\nonce, and then I didn\'t hurt her.\'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I\'m\ndrawing my own conclusions.You may not have struck her, but you did\nworse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.What has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of\ncare for her.The responsibility for what has happened is mainly\nyours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and\nto "forgive her"--you\'re "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me\nthat it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.\'Easton made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:\n\n\'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to\nthink right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don\'t\nthink either of you could be happy.Your only chance of happiness is\nto realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has\nsomething to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.\'Easton made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways\ndiverging, they wished each other \'Good night\'.They were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new\nconservatory at Mr Sweater\'s house, \'The Cave\'.This job was finished\nthe next day and at four o\'clock the boy brought the handcart, which\nthey loaded with their ladders and other materials.They took these\nback to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the\nfront shop and handed in their time sheets.Afterwards, as they were\nabout to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their\nconversation of the previous evening.He had been very reserved and\nsilent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had\nbeen engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of\ncatch in his voice as he spoke.\'I\'ve been thinking over what you said last night; it\'s quite true.I wrote to Ruth last night and\nadmitted it to her.I\'ll take it as a favour if you and your wife will\nsay what you can to help me get her back.\'Owen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: \'You may\nrely on us both to do our best.\'Chapter 51\n\nThe Widow\'s Son\n\n\nThe next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o\'clock\nHunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better\ncome on Monday in case some work came in.They accordingly went on the\nMonday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing \'came in\' of course\nthey did not do any work.On Thursday morning the weather was dark and\nbitterly cold.The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and\na keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.Owen--who had\ncaught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at\nSweater\'s house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten\no\'clock.He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had\nnot needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to\ndo.Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although\nhe had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others\nwere idle, they had not saved any money.On the contrary, during all\nthe summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or\nclothing.Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or\nsome other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to\ngo without some of the necessaries of life.They had broken boots,\nshabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.The weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid\nup if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,\nand that week they had to almost starve.Not that it was much better\nother weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a\nday--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o\'clock in the evening,\nand on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till\none.This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings\nand sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,\nwhich was not always.Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out\nof six.The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one\npound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those\nwho--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week\'s wages amounted\nto fifteen and sixpence.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a\nfew hours, their \'Saturday night\' sometimes amounted to half a\nsovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most\nof them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,\ntheir wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children\nwhom they had to bring up for the most part on\'skim\' milk, bread,\nmargarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites\nof eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the\nmorning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,\nand all day on Saturday, carrying butchers\' trays loaded with meat,\nbaskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or\ndelivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old\nenough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen\nthey left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they\nwere old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were\nfound physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older\nthey were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the\nsurest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of\nLiberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule\nover them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the\ndirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping\nknife prevented him from hearing Owen\'s approach and the latter stood\nwatching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the\npaint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and\nfrail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the\nsleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any\ndirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his\nattire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,\nand his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of\nFrankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would\never be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,\nremarking that it was very cold.There\'s lots of wood lying about the\nyard.\'Misery\nwouldn\'t \'arf ramp if \'e caught me at it.I used to \'ave a fire \'ere\nlast winter till Rushton found out, and \'e kicked up an orful row and\ntold me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn\'t feel\nthe cold.\'\'Oh, he said that, did he?\'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly\nsuffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a\nshed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken\nout of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an\narmful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted\nhim.\'You mustn\'t go burnin\' any of that, you know!That\'s all got to be\nsaved and took up to the bloke\'s house.Misery spoke about it only\nthis mornin\'.\'He carried the wood into the shop and after\nthrowing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,\napplying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several\nmore armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took\nno part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them\nbecause he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when\nthe fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his\nwork to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the\nheat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but\nas that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:\n\n\'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those\nthings and any other old paint or rubbish that\'s here, and whenever it\ngrows dull put more wood on.There\'s a lot of old stuff here that\'s of\nno use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says\nanything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it\nburning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.\'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his\nface so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the\nlatter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and\nfelt half afraid of him.\'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say\nI told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again\nwithout a fire, I\'ll report it to the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get\nmore wood, don\'t you attempt to interfere with him.\'\'I don\'t want to interfere with the bloody kid,\' grunted Sawkins.\'It\nseems to me as if he\'s gorn orf \'is bloody crumpet,\' he added as he\nwatched Owen walking rapidly down the street.\'I can\'t understand why\npeople can\'t mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy\nbelonged to \'IM.\'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that\nit was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and\ninfuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the\nSlave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing\nthem--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them\nwere offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,\nobserving how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of\nthese days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached\nthe shop he was scarcely able to speak.\'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?\'\'Hunter isn\'t, but the guv\'nor is.\'He\'ll soon--know--that,\' panted Owen as he strode up to the office\ndoor, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and\nentered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp\ncellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and\nlit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade\'s chair with his left arm\nround her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was\ndisarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton\njumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the\nintruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood\npanting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a\ntrembling finger at his employer:\n\n\'I\'ve come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert\nWhite--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I\'ll have you\nprosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a\nvaluable dog--you wouldn\'t keep it there--I give you fair warning--I\nknow--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you\ndon\'t treat him better I\'ll have you punished I\'ll show you up.\'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and\nperplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he\nwas guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear\nto be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of\nbeing caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce\nhim to a condition approaching terror.\'If the boy has been there without a fire, I \'aven\'t known anything\nabout it,\' he stammered at last.\'Mr \'Unter has charge of all those\nmatters.\'\'You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and\nanyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother\nunder the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for\nthe last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast\nof burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make\nyou--wish you had done so.\'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton\nin a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize\nthat the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would\nnot give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would\nmean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done\nright.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were\nplenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had\nthe work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;\nfor her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he\nhad acted as he did.\'We\'ll get through somehow, I suppose,\' said Owen, wearily.\'There\'s\nnot much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall\ntry to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of\nshow-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from\nsome of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but\nI\'m afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they\nwant.\'\'I shouldn\'t go out again today if I were you,\' said Nora, noticing how\nill he looked.\'You should stay at home and read, or write up those\nminutes.\'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local\nbranch of the Painters\' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and\nas the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the\nmanner his wife suggested, until four o\'clock, when Frankie returned\nfrom school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a\npiece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he\nbelieved it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to\neconomize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so\nnear the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how\nmuch coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place\ncolder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of\nthe ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the\nfuture made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next\nmorning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set\nabout preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it\nwould not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more\ncardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in\nbed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner\nbecause the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so\nsaturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous\nday.\'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there\'s any other work to be\nhad before I buy the cardboard,\' said Owen, \'although I\'m afraid it\'s\nnot much use.\'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he\nwas going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy\nwas carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.\'A corfin plate,\' he explained as he arrived at the door.\'Wanted at\nonce--Misery ses you can do it at \'ome, an\' I\'ve got to wait for it.\'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was\nnot to be dismissed after all.\'There\'s a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party\nwhat\'s dead,\' continued Bert, \'and here\'s a little bottle of Brunswick\nblack for you to do the inscription with.\'\'Yes: he told me to tell you there\'s a job to be started Monday\nmorning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be\nfinished by Thursday; and there\'s another job \'e wants you to do this\nafternoon--after dinner--so you\'ve got to come to the yard at one\no\'clock.\'E told me to tell you \'e meant to leave a message for you\nyesterday morning, but \'e forgot.\'\'What did he say to you about the fire--anything?\'\'Yes: they both of \'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery\nand the Bloke too--but they didn\'t kick up a row.I wasn\'t arf\nfrightened, I can tell you, when I saw \'em both coming, but they was\nquite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that\'s right, my boy," \'e ses.I\'m going to send you some coke," \'e ses.And\nthen they \'ad a look round and \'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of\nglass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big\npacking-case what was under the truck shed?\'\'Well, \'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of\nthe paint-shop with it.It ain\'t \'arf all right there now.I\'ve\ncleared out all the muck from under the benches and we\'ve got two sacks\nof coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that\'s all\nused up I\'ve got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.\'At one o\'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who\ninstructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the\nracks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work\nRushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.\'I\'m very glad you let me know about the boy working in that\npaint-shop,\' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.\'I can\nassure you as I don\'t want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I\ncan\'t attend to everything myself.I\'m much obliged to you for telling\nme about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same\nmyself.\'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without\nwaiting...\n\n\n\nChapter 52\n\n\'It\'s a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done\'\n\n\nAlthough Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to\nhave had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority\nof their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of\nthe time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended\ndisciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe\nthat all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact\nthe usual farce that they called \'Dealing\' with the misery that\nsurrounded them on every side.They continued to organize \'Rummage\'\nand \'Jumble\' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off\nclothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the\nBrethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful\nDistress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren\nhad registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful\ninvestigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred\nand seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their\nliving.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and\nseventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped\nby the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to\nenable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful\ndodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were\nDealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a\nmuch larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering\nthemselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous\nyears it had been the practice to issue an application form called a\n\'Record Paper\' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother\nreturned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the\nCommittee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a\ngood joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of\napplicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were\nissued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one\nat a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after\nthe manner of a French Juge d\'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the\nclerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.\'Where did you live before you went there?\'\'How long were you living at that place?\'\'Did you owe any rent when you left?\'\'What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?\'\'Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?\'\'What kind of a house do you live in?\'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,\nhow many hours a day?\'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you\nhave worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you\nleft them?\'\'Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the\nlast five years?\'\'Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or\nfrom any other source?\'\'Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?\'\'Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have\nmentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers\nhad all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the\nCommittee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due\ncourse visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the\nAuthorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the\nCommittee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to\nsay nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a\nmeans of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea\nworked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr\nWeakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother\nGrinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There\nwas one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be\npestered with \'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if\nhe--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give\nWeakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified\nBrother Grinder\'s prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr\nWeakling\'s ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,\nGrinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly\nreturned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian\nof the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as\nthe dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what\nwork was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly\nevery night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over\nspecifications and making out estimates.The police had become so\naccustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took\nno notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the\nscene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat\nobserved the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no\nparticular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning\nand the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound\ndisturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was\nlocked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the\ninside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window\nwas low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the\nglass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery\nwas that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to\nturn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves\nor anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their\npresence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to\nresume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed\nthat the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right\none and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small\nspeck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,\nwhere a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had\nshelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to\nget a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he\ngave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look\nin his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish\nthe figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office\ndoor: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and\nas it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great\npool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from\nthe place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his\nhead nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right\nhand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the\nside of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being\nlittered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when\nHunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and\ngenerally doing his best to fill the dead man\'s place, although--as he\nconfided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had\nno intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the\nbody--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work\nwas to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this\nestimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening\nin the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered\nwith figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified\nthe subsequent verdict of the Coroner\'s jury that Hunter committed\nsuicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a\nlot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no\nintelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had\nevidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a\ndifferent way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his\npossession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this\nwas accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who\nsaw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor\nwith him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called\nfor it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr\nHunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a\nnew second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in\nhonour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk\nhat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter\'s tall one,\nwhich he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper\ninside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in\nHunter\'s place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,\nbut with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour\nexcept one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small\npatch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot\nhad been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could\nremember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with\nsomething the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation\nto the cold having \'got into it last winter\'.It was rather strange,\ntoo, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he\nalways wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady\nwho died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this\nlittle sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it\noccasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53\n\nBarrington Finds a Situation\n\n\nThe revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the\nprogress of the election was intensified by the final result.The\nblind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists\nfor those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy\nwith regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in\nwhich they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in\npoverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their\ncallous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage\nhatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the\npossibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the\nhopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the\nrenegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:\n\n\'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I\'m finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,\nthey vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their\nown choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with\nscorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,\nsemi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and\nuphold it.Let them drudge and let\nthem starve!\'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded\nstreets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops\nwere all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,\nand the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with\nsightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed\nmen and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the\npoulterers\' and butchers\' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried\nrows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share\nmany of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly\nat their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the\nwomen, evidently working men\'s wives.Their faded, ill-fitting\ngarments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn\nfaces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little\nchildren who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers\' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and\ndependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the\nwistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of\nthe toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and\nfilled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy\nand all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the\nthings that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they\nwere not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his\nheart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the\nmidst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame\nbecause he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest\ncause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of\nthe disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children\nwere standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some\nof these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro\nbefore the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way\nin which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their\ncages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from\none end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed\nagainst the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each\nother the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a\nlarge strongly built waggon.\'If I had that I\'d give Freddie rides in\nit and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines\nas well.\'\'I\'d rather have this railway,\' said Frankie Owen.\'There\'s a real\ntunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there\'s the station and the\nsignals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to\nlight when there\'s danger on the line.\'\'Mine\'s this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes\nthat you can take off,\' said Elsie; \'and this tea set; and this\nneedlecase for Mother.\'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung\ntightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and\ndesire.\'But it\'s no use lookin\' at them any longer,\' continued Elsie, with a\nsigh, as she took hold of Freddie\'s hand to lead him away.\'It\'s no\nuse lookin\' at \'em any longer; the likes of us can\'t expect to have\nsuch good things as them.\'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities\nof life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to\nfollow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not\nlived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were\nnot for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he\npursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a\ngee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort\nhim by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the\nwindows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to\nbring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any\nimpression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at\nonce.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom\nthey hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain\ngifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from\nhim.\'Hello, Mr Barrington,\' said the two boys in a breath.\'Hello,\' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby\'s cheek.\'He wants that there \'orse, mister, the one with the real \'air on,\'\nsaid Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized\nthe absurdity of the demand.\'Fweddie want gee-gee,\' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington\'s\nhand and returning to the window.\'Tell him that Santa Claus\'ll bring it to him on Christmas,\' whispered\nElsie.\'P\'raps he\'ll believe you and that\'ll satisfy him, and he\'s\nsure to forget all about it in a little while.\'\'Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?\'\'I\'ve got something to do at last.\'\'Well, that\'s a good job, ain\'t it?\'\'And whom do you think I\'m working for?\'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest\nextent.\'Yes,\' continued Barrington, solemnly.\'You know, he is a very old man\nnow, so old that he can\'t do all his work himself.Last year he was so\ntired that he wasn\'t able to get round to all the children he wanted to\ngive things to, and consequently a great many of them never got\nanything at all.So this year he\'s given me a job to help him.He\'s\ngiven me some money and a list of children\'s names, and against their\nnames are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the\nthings and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.\'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible\nas the story seemed, Barrington\'s manner was so earnest as to almost\ncompel belief.\'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?\'said Frankie at\nlength, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an\nawestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of\nhis hands.\'Really and truly,\' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his\npocket-book and turned over the leaves.\'I\'ve got the list here;\nperhaps your names are down for something.\'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they\nlistened wide-eyed for what was to follow.\'Let me see,\' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,\n\'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can\nbe taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse\nwith real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of\ngroceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with\nreal coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines\nround.\'Barrington closed the book: \'So you may as well have your things now,\'\nhe continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.\'We\'ll buy them here;\nit will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking\nthem round to where you live.It\'s lucky I happened to meet you, isn\'t\nit?\'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to\ngasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the\nfour whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in\na half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at\nall.It couldn\'t be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They\ndid not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and\nhanded it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely\nconscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington\nwas talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the\nsound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one\nparcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,\nwas also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie\'s heart nearly burst\nwhen the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said \'Good night\' to Frankie,\nwho went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he\nwere walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant\'s near\nby, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that\nhe had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a\npair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy\nthese, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of\nholes, so they went to a draper\'s and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure\nSanta Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,\nbut had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54\n\nThe End\n\n\nThe following evening Barrington called at Owen\'s place.He said he\nwas going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,\nalthough he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share\nof work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they\noften had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that\nthe slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,\nwhich made it almost impossible to work even when he had the\nopportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will\nthat he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up\nappearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew\nthat Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook\nit so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very\nuseful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with\nwhom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a\nmate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two\nmen\'s work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it\nmakes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in\nthe winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local\nhospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid\nthey were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in\nthe town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the\nhospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they\ngave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill\nin the ticket or application form with the name and address of the\napplicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a\ndeserving case,\'suitable to receive this charity\'.In common with the\nmajority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to\nthis hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a\nprivate doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a\nparticular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The\nmedicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for\nthe truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of\nothers--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things\nthat had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been\ndying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to\nbuy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but\nalthough some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough\nfor him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of\nbeing unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to\nbelieve that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once\nmore.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in\nthe sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off\nthe ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in\nRushton\'s home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.\'I have never told you before,\' said Barrington, after they had been\ntalking for a while, \'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not\nwork for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just\nwanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the\nmajority.He doesn\'t approve of my\nopinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding\nthem, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own\nway.I\'m going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring\nI intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We\'ll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we\'ll hold\nmeetings every night; we\'ll drench the town with literature, and we\'ll\nstart a branch of the party.\'Owen\'s eye kindled and his pale face flushed.\'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,\' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.\'\'And I can help to give away handbills,\' chimed in Frankie, looking up\nfrom the floor, where he was seated working the railway.\'I know a lot\nof boys who\'ll come along with me to put \'em under the doors as well.\'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in\nthe next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door\nbell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing\nthe door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,\nand from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the\nadjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the\nfront door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with\nexcitement, burst into the room, crying out:\n\n\'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering\ngleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified\nby this extraordinary conduct.\'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she\'s gone home\nagain with them,\' replied Freddie, \'and--she\'s given the baby to us for\na Christmas box!\'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton\'s separation\nfrom his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;\nit was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to\nwrite.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then\nshe helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested\nthat the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer\'s shop at the end of the street.He went in here\nand bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed\nthe pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with\nthe two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having\naddressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for\nhim outside.\'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I\ndon\'t want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get\nhome.\'\'I won\'t stop running all the way.\'\'I think I have time to\ngo back with you as far as your front door,\' he said, \'then I shall be\nquite sure you haven\'t lost it.\'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the\nentrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a\nmoment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and\nlooking over the banisters.\'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you\nwere to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we\ncould wave back.\'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of\nOwen\'s flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he\nheard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the\nside-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious\nmeeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and\non the glass of this lamp was painted: \'Be not deceived: God is not\nmocked.\'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they\nhad come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy\nto hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of\nthe Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the\norganizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he\nwas \'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there\nco-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,\nRushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd\nas his \'Brothers and Sisters\' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the \'Brothers\': Mr Sweater, resplendent in\na new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr\nGrinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged\nworship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk\nhats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they\nhad fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr\nDauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he\nwas paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing\nin his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function\nwas to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of\nrespectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang\nof swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority\nof the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his\npresence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical\nrepresentatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity\nhave made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of\'respectable\', well-dressed people who\nlooked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily\ndressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of\nplace in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced\nworking men and women, most of them dressed in other people\'s cast-off\nclothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give\nout the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of\nhis remarks:\n\n\n        \'Oh, come and jine this \'oly band,\n        And hon to glory go.\'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of\nthem ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were\nconducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of\nChrist--Christians!Jesus said: \'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth\', \'Love not\nthe world nor the things of the world\', \'Woe unto you that are rich--it\nis easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich\nman to enter the kingdom of heaven.\'Yet all these self-styled\n\'Followers\' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal\nbusiness of their lives.Jesus said: \'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and\ngrievous to be borne, and lay them on men\'s shoulders, but they\nthemselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is\nyour master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.\'But nearly all\nthese alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be\nother people\'s masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,\nwhilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and\nfared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands\nof those they hypocritically called their \'brethren\', men, women and\nlittle children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have\nalready seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton\nand the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus\npreached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not\nseem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,\nthat Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to\nforget that Jesus said, \'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do\nnot the things I say?...\'\'Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and\ndoeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house\nupon the sand.\'But although none of these self-styled \'Followers\' of Christ, ever did\nthe things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and\nsang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to\nexhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And\nthey procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: \'Be not deceived,\nGod is not mocked.\'They stigmatized as \'infidels\' all those who differed from them,\nforgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically\nfalse and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several\nother infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had\naddressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,\nof whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain\npleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as\nRushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:\n\n        \'Come and jine this \'Oly band and hon to glory go!\'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium\nstruck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the\nsinging:\n\n        \'Oh, come and join this \'oly band and hon to glory go.\'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the\ncrowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to\nBarrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was\nSlyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by\nname.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:\n\n\'I don\'t want that--from you,\' he said contemptuously.\'Oh, I know what you\'re thinking of,\' he said after\na pause and speaking in an injured tone; \'but you shouldn\'t judge\nanyone too hard.It wasn\'t only my fault, and you don\'t know \'ow much\nI\'ve suffered for it.If it \'adn\'t been for the Lord, I believe I\nshould \'ave drownded myself.\'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was\nfinished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a\nhearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing\nweek at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there\nspecially, of course, because it was the place with which he was\nhimself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they\nwould not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places\nof worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly\nevery street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining\nLight could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did\nhope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go\nSomewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for\nthe presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed\ndisciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore\nmore respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each\nother or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two\npoor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with\nthe hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried\noff to catch the train one of the \'Followers\' gave him a card which he\nread by the light of a street lamp--\n\n                   Come and join the Brotherhood\n                    at the Shining Light Chapel\n                                PSA\n                    Every Sunday at 3 o\'clock.\'Oh come and join this Holy Band\n                        and on to Glory go.\'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a\nplace--with some decent people, than share \'glory\' with a crew like\nthis.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep\nin her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had\nboth been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington\'s departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton\nand Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of\naccomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their\nown position.\'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,\' said\nNora at last breaking the long silence, \'and Frankie is so fond of her\ntoo.But all the same I can\'t feel happy about it when I think how ill\nyou are.\'\'Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,\' said\nOwen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.\'We have always pulled\nthrough somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make\nmuch difference, and she\'ll be as well off with us as she would have\nbeen if Ruth had not gone back.\'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child\nand the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent\na thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,\ndependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he\nwould never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had\nsometimes entertained in hours of despondency.\'We\'ve always got through somehow or other,\' he repeated, \'and we\'ll do\nso still.\'Presently they heard Frankie\'s footsteps ascending the stairs and a\nmoment afterwards the boy entered the room.\'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his\ntrain goes over the bridge,\' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.\'\'There\'s plenty of time yet,\' replied Owen, smiling at the boy\'s\nimpetuosity.We don\'t want the window open\nall that time.It\'s only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and\nthat\'s five minutes fast.\'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past\nunnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the\nglass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while\nOwen opened the letter:\n\n\'Dear Owen,\n\n\'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the\nother for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself\nin the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you\nif our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you\nwould willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you\nby refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White\'s\nmother.\'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for\nthe fray when I come back in the spring,\n\n                             \'Yours for the cause,\n\n                                                  \'George Barrington.\'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly\nunderstand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not\nhave spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who\nfelt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted\nfrom her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as\nshe thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the\ndirection of the station.\'Don\'t you think we\'d better have the window open now, Dad?\'he said at\nlast as the clock struck eight.\'The steam keeps coming on the glass\nas fast as I wipe it off and I can\'t see out properly.I\'m sure it\'s\nnearly time now; p\'raps our clock isn\'t as fast as you think it is.\'\'All right, we\'ll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,\' said\nOwen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the\nchild up in a shawl, joined them at the window.\'It can\'t be much longer now, you know,\' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened\nthe window.\'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it\ndrew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came\ninto sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were\nilluminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;\na few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed\nas it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later\nit thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his\nface, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a\nhandkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in\nreturn.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the\nlights at the rear of the guard\'s van, and presently even those\nvanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the\nadjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the\nroad were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents\'\nadvertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop\nformerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt\ntwo or three months previously, was also plastered with similar\ndecorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the\npremises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were\njust being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were\nclosing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more\ncheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the\nmoon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;\nbut a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the\nweather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being\nconcealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly\naccumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few\nminutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that\nthe gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the\nInfamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting\nfor their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each\nother like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;\nabundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and\ncrime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of\nworking for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and\ncold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time\ntheir grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the\nblack masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,\nseemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist\nSystem.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest\nmeasure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling\ninto ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so\nwicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and\ncurse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for\never, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the\nCo-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of\nbondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain\nprone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving\nasunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from\nthem the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide\nFatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of\nthe beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in\ntrue brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be\ndiffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun\nof Socialism.Appendix\n\nMugsborough\n\n\nMugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two\nhundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking\nwest, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand\nParade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad\nhills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,\ncultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles\naway.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful\nand sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the\nwealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous\nboarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,\nthe town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the\nother side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working\nclasses lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more\ncostly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of\nlate years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on\nthe Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of\nEngland.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of\nprosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what\nwere called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The\nGrand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and\ncarriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of\nour story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair\noutward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited\nsepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the\nmajority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty\nwhich in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for\nthis was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and\nboarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working\nclasses were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public\nworks and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased\nthe rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services\nundertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every\npublic service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of\nprivate companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the\nhands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the\nCorporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of\ntheir number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of\nwhom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which\nbattened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,\nthe Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous\nothers.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,\nDidlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the\noldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown\nwith the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the\ngreater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although\nthey lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by\nlaw from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently\nfound it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They\npaid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of\ncourse--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and\nluxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of\nBonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the\nprofits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the\nworkmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by\nthe terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of\ncourse none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing\nthat.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about\nthem.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small\namount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy\nthe Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon\nwhom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that\nthe sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but\nit was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally\nconsidered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough\nhad to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company\nfor the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the\nCouncil.The address was short, but much to the substance of\nthe speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said\nthat what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was\never his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them\nin their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to\nsettle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.It was reported the\nsubscribers were above 1,000.But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was\nassured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty\nasked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party\nmight consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,\nand then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that\nfor the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very\nsmall, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and\nthose chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.Blathwaite\'s (two miles from Hampton).This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having\nraised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.He is a\nvery proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides\nall this, has married a great fortune.His income by the Army, Council,\nand Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in\nabove L2,000 per annum.The Privy Seal for L6,000 was passed to me, so that this\ntedious affair was dispatched.Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous\nsummer.The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich\nChurch.[Sidenote: WOTTON]\n\n19th July, 1687.In the way, I dined at Ashted, with\nmy Lady Mordaunt.I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr.Finch (the\nKing\'s Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the\ngarden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where\nwas my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had\naccompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;\nthe King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not\ndaring to trust his own subjects.Notwithstanding this, the Danes are\nexceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been\nfive weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very\nnobly.God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my\nmany troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me.The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to\nbe one of the Governors of St.PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,\npriests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at\nSt.Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly\nimproved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.I was godfather to Sir John Chardin\'s son, christened\nat Greenwich Church, named John.The Earl of Bath and Countess of\nCarlisle, the other sponsors.An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a\nmechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor.The King and Queen, and Dadi, the\nPope\'s Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall.A strange turn of\naffairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of\nPopery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who\nrepresented the very person of their Antichrist!My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been\non a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of\nland.I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see\nhis house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place.To a very ordinary\nhouse he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to\nit than the place deserves, in my opinion.He desired my advice about\nlaying out his gardens, etc.The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see\nsome pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk\'s, particularly the statue, or\nchild in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to\nthink it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under\nvery deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and\nespecially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to\nbe favorable to him.My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to\nLady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord\nPresident of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent\nus, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.There was a solemn and particular office used at\nour, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a\nthanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.This afternoon I went not to church, being employed\non a religious treatise I had undertaken._Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]\n\n    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was\n    written.]Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our\ncurate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent\nPrince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1\nSamuel xxvi.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n12th February, 1688.My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in\nthe city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in\nsuch manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her\nknees.Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no\nother harm.In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly\nwell; through God Almighty\'s great mercy to an excellent wife and a most\ndutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.I received the sad news of my niece Montague\'s\ndeath at Woodcot on the 15th.I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in\norder to have my quietus.Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published\nhis extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating\nthe test and penal laws, died.He was esteemed a violent, passionate,\nhaughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he\nutterly refused it.The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those\nProtestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in\ndungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so\nlong trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,\nbut utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great\nnumbers came daily into England and other places, where they were\nreceived and relieved with very considerate Christian charity.This\nProvidence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,\ndid so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the\npersecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went\nto mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in\ntheir conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great\nnumbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and\nlieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to\nreturn to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but\npeaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but\nso without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or\nsedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,\nmeeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers\nand priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever\nthey could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced\ndeath, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their\npersecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former\nassembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible\nconstancy, that through God\'s mercy they might obtain pardon for this\nlapse.Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the\nprimitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in\nthe end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on\nhis Providence.I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house\nand estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a\nhard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in\ngaming few exceeded him.Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,\nhouse, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of\nrelation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of\nColchester, forty years before.It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,\nand well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an\nhonest gentleman and soldier.He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of\nWorcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother\nbeing without children.They are descendants of the great lawyer of that\nname, and give the same arms and motto.Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and\nhe has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple\'s near to it; the\nmost remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the\nwall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better\nthan I ever noted.There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke\'s, in both these\nhouses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel\'s, whose orangery and\n_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept.He was contriving\nvery high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,\nand painting those reeds in oil.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n1st April, 1688.In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.Paul\'s (at Whitehall), on Luke x.The\nHoly Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in\nof multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the\nBishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could\nhardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great\ntrouble.The Princess being come, he preached on Mich.8, 9, 10,\ndescribing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the\nBabylonian persecution, for her sins, and God\'s delivery of her on her\nrepentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,\nwhenever insulted and persecuted.He preached with his accustomed\naction, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to\nhear him.A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and\nmany very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a\nsecond general contribution, the <DW7>s, by God\'s Providence, as yet\nmaking small progress among us.The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an\nalmost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there\nwas little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very\nfavorable as to frost and snow.To London, about my petition for allowances upon the\naccount of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with\nHolland.His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch\n(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their\nfleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or\nhad any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been\noccasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound\npeace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no\nforce at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was\ndoubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance\nPopery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances\npursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in\nthe Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance\non Popish promises.The King enjoining the ministers to read his\nDeclaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all\nchurches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]\nPeterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St.Asaph,[69] and\nBristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his\nMajesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to\nthe several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were\naverse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward\ndissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a\ntemper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered\nand settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration\nbeing founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside\nall laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it\nhad done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of\nsuch consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to\nit, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted\nto.[Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening\nexpressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,\nand so dismissed them.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n20th May, 1688.I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning\nlessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read\nthe chapters.I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost\nuniversally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a\nlittle time will show.All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to\nread the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc.It seems the\ninjunction came so crudely from the Secretary\'s office, that it was\nneither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so\nas the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great\ndifficulties how to proceed against them.Great were the consults, and a\nproclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done.The action\nof the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse\nparties, <DW7>s only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and\nviolent courses were every moment expected.Report was, that the\nProtestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the\nsudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling\nher, declares her resolution to stay.News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever\nheard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a\ndreadful inundation following it.This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the\nBishops of Ely, Chichester, St.Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath\nand Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for\nrefusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the\nDeclaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it\nwould have prejudiced their peerage.The concern of the people for them\nwas wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,\nand praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower\nwharf.A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.About two o\'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells\nring for the birth of a Prince of Wales.This was very surprising, it\nhaving been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the\nnext month.I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the\nArchbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St.Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought\nto Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they\nwere called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was\nillegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.The\nCourt then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they\nrefused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear\nthat day fortnight; the Archbishop in L200, the Bishops in L100 each.Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about\nfor the young Prince\'s birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by\nthe Bishop of Rochester.They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the\nmorning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of\ntheir verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning.The\njury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an\nacquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.At length he\nagreed with the others.The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great\nmoderation and civility to the Bishops.Alibone, a <DW7>, was strongly\nagainst them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,\nthey were acquitted.When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and\nthere was a lane of people from the King\'s Bench to the water side, on\ntheir knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill\nat Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on\nthe bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along\nfull of comfort and cheerful.Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used\nthem very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.Godolphin and his brother Sir William to\nSt.Alban\'s, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St.Alban\'s, a very good collection of\nbooks, especially in divinity; he was to give L300 for them.Having seen\nthe GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we\nreturned home.One of the King\'s chaplains preached before the Princess\non Exodus xiv.13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"\nwhich he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of\nEngland, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.The\nPopish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned\nadversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in\nhigh discontent.Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his\ntreason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,\nwere sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that\nparty from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now\nthey began to do, foreseeing the design of the <DW7>s to descend and\ntake in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed\nthem to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation\nof the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.This night the fireworks were played off, that had been\nprepared for the Queen\'s upsitting.We saw them to great advantage; they\nwere very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,\nstatues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I\nfound very cheerful.Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some\ngreat thing discovered.This was the Prince of Orange intending to come\nover.I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy\nmiles.A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and\ncarried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from\nthence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles\nbeyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o\'clock that evening.Both\nthese coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,\nwho invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my\nson with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my\nLord\'s chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest\ndiscourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his\nsermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the\nparsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least L600 a year in\nspiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of\nquality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according\ntherewith.My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton\'s Seat, a very strong, large\nhouse, built with stone, not altogether modern.They were enlarging the\ngarden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening\ninto the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers\npainted with blue and gilded.There is a noble walk of elms toward the\nfront of the house by the bowling green.I was not in any room of the\nhouse besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new\nCountess (Sir Stephen Fox\'s daughter, whom I had known from a child)\nentertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly\nmarried to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,\nand so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to\nAlthorpe, twelve miles distant.[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]\n\nThe house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in\nform of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _a la\nmoderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,\ngalleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.It\nis situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and\nall this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and\nwalks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game.And, what\nis above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of\nsolicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and\nwithout, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is\nany in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact\norder, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble.The\nmeanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the\nseveral tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire\neconomy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person.She is one who\nfor her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I\nmust ever honor and celebrate.I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband\n(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of\nher, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself\nunworthy!This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much\naffliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.The\nCountess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the\ncomfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,\nespecially Mr.Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very\nlearned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord\nSpencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his\nfamily, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all\nimaginable care of his education.There is a daughter very young married\nto the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,\nbut who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally\ncontaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age!But this is\nagain recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who\nhas espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable\naccomplishments and virtue.I left this noble place and conversation, my lady\nhaving provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we\nwent, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a\ntown that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and\ntownhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter\nto the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any\nlonger among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the\nClergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in\nprejudice of the Church of England.The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which\nwith no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many\ndifficulties.The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;\nthe whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales\nby hand (so many of her Majesty\'s children having died infants) not\nsucceeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give\nit suck.I went to London, where I found the Court in the\nutmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange\'s landing; which\nput Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it\npossible to find such a change.Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back\nthe good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the\nChurch of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the\npeople, who showed their high discontent at several things in the\nGovernment.Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other\nplaces in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of\ngreater calamities.God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put\nthemselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be\noverpassed.The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on\nassurance of the Prince of Orange\'s intention to land, that the writs\nsent forth for a Parliament were recalled.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n7th October, 1688.16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its\nperfection above all traditions.After which, near 1,000 devout persons\npartook of the Communion.The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,\nwho in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture\nand railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they\npulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch\nthat it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange\'s invasion heightened to that\ndegree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the\ndispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all\nlaws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford.In\nthe meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued\nto remove Protestants and put in <DW7>s at Portsmouth and other places\nof trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal\ndiscontent.It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed\npassionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom\nthey looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying\nincessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of\nhis expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent.To such a\nstrange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation\nreduced, and of which I was an eyewitness.The apprehension was (and\nwith reason) that his Majesty\'s forces would neither at land nor sea\noppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and\nthe Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by\ntheir usual tricks.A letter was sent to the Archbishop of\nCanterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving\nby them.A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared\ninvasion.The letter was as follows:--\n\n    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace\'s piety,\n    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not\n    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally\n    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her\n    discipline; God Almighty\'s Providence and blessing upon your Grace\'s\n    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be\n    diminished in this conjuncture.The conversation I now and then have\n    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing\n    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church\'s adversaries,\n    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the\n    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been\n    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among\n    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have\n    no cause to apprehend.The plan of this and of all that which is to\n    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who\n    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all\n    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,\n    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should\n    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest\n    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally\n    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will\n    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will\n    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined\n    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is\n    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say\n    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which\n    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of\n    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or\n    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW\n    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,\n    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is\n    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so\n    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT\n    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and\n    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,\n    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words\n    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND\n    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come\n    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God\'s name, be they\n    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My\n    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I\n    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all\n    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does\n    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove\n    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace\'s pardon, with your\n    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn\'s\n    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory\nof William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The\nwind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful\nexpectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the\nchurches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a\nPopish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty\'s\ntaking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the\nQueen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown\nremiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some\nreported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret\nbetrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all\nthe ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort\'s labor, were\nto give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales\'s birth,\nrecorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two\nafter.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to\ncondescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this\noccasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and\nNottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their\nbold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among\nthem was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard\nbe true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,\nin the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of\nBurlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,\nand her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O\nblessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from\nthose dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to\nthis sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,\ndisposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if\nit be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which\nhitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir\nStephen Fox\'s.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no\ncertainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but\nwithout any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed\nmanifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet\nCouncil.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction\nof all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the\nFrench.There was in that of the Prince\'s an expression, as if the Lords\nboth spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of\nthe causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of\nCanterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what\nwas in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some\npublic writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the\nfleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on\nWednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take\nleave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere\nabout Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would\nhave been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince\nhaving landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing\nthrough the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not\nintercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great\nconsternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their\nfurther progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways\nvery improper for his Majesty\'s forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and\nLords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth\ntheir abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they\nhad never invited any of the Prince\'s party, or were in the least privy\nto it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,\nas to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty\nwould call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult\nwhat was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to\npublish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the\nPrince\'s manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the\nLords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they\ndeparted.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the\nPrince\'s manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his\nexpedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it\nby some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all\nlikelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we\ncannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray\nGod to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of\nhis people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and\nWarner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to\nHoniton, the Prince\'s headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the\nrabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord\nBerkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for\nsafety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful\naspect.The King goes to\nSalisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere\nappears for the Prince in Cheshire.The\nArchbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in\nLondon, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all\nforeign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and\nalarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the\nelection of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public\ncommotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of\nHalifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;\nhe told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of\nquality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,\nand go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations\nagainst the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,\nfly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public\nprint, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming\nto Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to\nPortsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not\ngrateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their\ncommissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like\na revolution.The rabble\ndemolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen\'s\nhouses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,\nand burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for\nballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to\nSt.James\'s, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General\nof the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained\nprisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his\nMajesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be\nquartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the\nKing goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on\nthe Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I\nwas present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to\nassent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve\no\'clock--a sad sight!James\'s, and fills\nWhitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient\nto call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,\nEarl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland\nflies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James\'s, where there is a\ngreat Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came\nover with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English\nsoldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and\nchild were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the\nParliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the\nPrince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till\na convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by\nhis circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had\nnow quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first\nleft off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost\nfrozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I\nfound the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and\nChichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,\nLord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,\nconcerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find\nthere was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and\nCommons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen\nwithout any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory\nparty (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon\nconditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of\nOrange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several\nparties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other\ninterest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing\nof all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me\ninto their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve\ntheir oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty\'s name,\nby that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws\nin being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent\nhim in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,\nand that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were\nindeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in\nthat Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this\nconjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that\nkingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate\nrequested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with\nthe Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at\npresent settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took\nmy leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the\nquestion about the government, resolved that King James having by the\nadvice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the\nlaws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away\nthe seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,\nhad by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did\ntherefore desire the Lords\' concurrence to their vote, to place the\ncrown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the\nPrincess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of\nDenmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever\nall possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a\nchild not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most\nprodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether\nmemory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined\nhim, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required\njudgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was\nnot anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of\nastronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the\nspheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,\nboundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any\nother part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and\ndemonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he\nwould describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things\nwhich are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,\nrepublics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred\nstories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the\nmonarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower\nEmperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,\nwhat they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of\nthe Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that\nto other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;\nwe asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable\nmeditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of\nthe Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and\nmoral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or\nangel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in\nknowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard\nof, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the\nPrince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms\nwithout any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of\nnothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the\nGreat out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to\nmeet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little\nconflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was\nreceived with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms\nonly, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin\nauthors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,\nItaly, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient\nGreece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning\nfurther.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who\nhad learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going\nabout the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner\n(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a\nlively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,\nwithout the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by\ncausing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but\nhis tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in\nLatin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every\nday, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was\nperfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum\n(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious\nyouths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of\nanything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who\nhas more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father\nnot to set his heart too much on this jewel,\n\n    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"\n\nas I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,\nmany years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in\nshape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up\nby Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the\nPrince\'s lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much\nof the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for\nthe House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after\nall had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three\nvoices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority\nalleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and\nexpressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down\nparticularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:\nothers that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration\nwas chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine\nbishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and\nthe clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,\non their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the\nbishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to\ndissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the\nPrince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and\nothers, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they\nmade their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to\nhis interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done\ntoward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,\nthat we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober\nestablishment!\'s MARTYRDOM; but\nin all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany\nfor the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached\nbefore the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a\nthanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers\npurposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very\nhonest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances\nof our Church, without touching on politics.The King\'s coronation day was ordered not to be\nobserved, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and\nPrincess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland\n(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being\nto enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to\nbe vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in\nboth names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of\nsuch, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of\nsuch, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that\nfailing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These\nproduced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented\nheads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these\nconditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King\'s abdication, and whether he had\nvacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,\nand many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great\nagainst them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom\nbeing in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel\'s army, and expectations\nfrom France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading\nFlanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this\nwill be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in\nmany years.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n21st February, 1689.James\'s on the\nobligation to walk worthy of God\'s particular and signal deliverance of\nthe nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her\ncoming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation\nand general good reception.It was believed\nthat both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)\nreluctance at least, of assuming her father\'s crown, and made some\napology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement\nnecessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would\nhave shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character\ngiven of her piety; consonant also to her husband\'s first declaration,\nthat there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the\nnation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall\nlaughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,\nbefore her women were up, went about from room to room to see the\nconvenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the\nlate Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as\nthe Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to\neverybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since\nher last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see\nher, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to\nheart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is\nwonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike\ngravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France\ncalling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden\nassumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some\nconditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting\nto those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part\nof both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a\ncrown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such\nvehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all\npreferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been\ngiven him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the\nsame carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have\nwell spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it\nhad been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,\nacquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of\nconscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests\nand hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so\nmuch as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who\nobserved with what zeal they contributed to the Prince\'s expedition, and\nall the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the\nabsent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created\nmuch division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and\nespecially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention\nonly, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves\non the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with\nthe crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,\nthe government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;\nmost of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were\ndisposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of\nDevonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord\nChamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet\nnone in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as\nPrivy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but\nneither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not\nyet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent\ndiscourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of\nenemies; I suppose']
